## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration and dependencies for a Node.js project named "metriport-node-example". It sets up a TypeScript-based Express application that utilizes the Metriport API SDK for health and medical data management.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Metriport API SDK for accessing health and medical data |
| @metriport/shared | Common code shared across Metriport packages |
| express | Web application framework for Node.js |

## Scripts
| Script | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| start | Runs the main application using ts-node |
| mock-webhook | Runs a mock webhook script using ts-node |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| name | string | "metriport-node-example" | Project name |
| version | string | "1.0.0" | Project version |
| main | string | "index.js" | Entry point of the application |
| private | boolean | true | Prevents accidental publication to npm |

## DevDependencies
The project uses various development dependencies for TypeScript support, linting, and type definitions:

- TypeScript and related tools (ts-node, ts-node-dev)
- ESLint for code linting
- Type definitions for Express, Node.js, and other libraries

## Performance Considerations
The project uses `ts-node` for running TypeScript files directly, which may have some performance overhead in production environments. For production deployment, it's recommended to compile TypeScript to JavaScript and run the compiled code.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this configuration file. However, the project might benefit from adding production build and deployment scripts in the future.
