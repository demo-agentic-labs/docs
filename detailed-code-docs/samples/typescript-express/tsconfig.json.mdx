## High-level description
This `tsconfig.json` file is a TypeScript configuration file for a Node.js project. It extends the base configuration for Node.js version 18 provided by the `@tsconfig/node18` package, which sets up commonly used TypeScript compiler options for Node.js 18 environments.

## Symbols

### Root object

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tsconfig/node18 | Provides a base TypeScript configuration for Node.js 18 projects |

This `tsconfig.json` file is minimal and relies on the `@tsconfig/node18` package to provide a set of default TypeScript compiler options suitable for Node.js 18 projects. By extending this base configuration, the project inherits a pre-configured set of options that are optimized for Node.js 18 development, reducing the need for manual configuration and ensuring consistency with best practices for TypeScript in Node.js environments.
