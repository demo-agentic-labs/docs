## High-level description
This code defines a mock GCP (Google Cloud Platform) class with methods for retrieving secrets and saving data to BigQuery. It uses environment variables to simulate secret management and provides a placeholder for BigQuery interactions.

## Symbols

### `GCP`
#### Description
A mock class that simulates interactions with Google Cloud Platform services, specifically secret management and BigQuery.

#### Methods

### `get_secret`
#### Description
A static method that retrieves a secret value from environment variables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secret_name | str | The name of the secret to retrieve |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secret_value | str | The value of the requested secret |

#### Internal Logic
The method uses `os.getenv()` to retrieve the value of the environment variable with the name specified by `secret_name`.

### `save_to_big_query`
#### Description
A method that simulates saving data to BigQuery.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | dict | The data to be saved to BigQuery |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This method is a placeholder and currently does not implement any functionality (it uses `pass`).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Used to load environment variables from a .env file |
| os | Used to access environment variables |

## Configuration
The code uses environment variables for configuration. These are loaded from a .env file using `load_dotenv()`.

## References
This mock GCP class is referenced in the related file `create_patient_trigger_webhook.py`. Specifically:

1. In the `MetriportAuth` class, an instance of `GCP` is created to retrieve the `METRIPORT_SECRET_KEY`.
2. In the `main` function, `GCP` is used to retrieve the `METRIPORT_FACILITY_ID`.

These references suggest that in a production environment, this mock `GCP` class would be replaced with actual interactions with Google Cloud Platform services for secret management and potentially BigQuery operations.
