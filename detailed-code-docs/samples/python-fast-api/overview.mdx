## High-level description
This directory contains a Python-based FastAPI implementation for interacting with the Metriport API and handling webhook events. It provides functionality for patient management, document querying, and processing various medical data events.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory allows developers to:
1. Create and manage patients in the Metriport system
2. Perform document and consolidated queries
3. Handle webhook events from Metriport, including document downloads, conversions, and consolidated data updates
4. Interact with Google Cloud Platform services for secret management and data storage

The main workflow involves creating patients, triggering webhooks, and then processing the incoming webhook events to perform actions such as querying for consolidated data and saving results to BigQuery.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this project are:

1. `create_patient_trigger_webhook.py`: This file contains utility functions for interacting with the Metriport API, including patient creation and data querying. It serves as the primary interface for developers to interact with Metriport's services.

2. `mock-webhook.py`: This file implements the FastAPI webhook endpoint that handles incoming events from Metriport. It processes different types of medical data events and performs appropriate actions based on the event type.

The data flow typically starts with creating a patient using functions from `create_patient_trigger_webhook.py`, which then triggers webhook events. These events are received and processed by the FastAPI application in `mock-webhook.py`, which may in turn make additional API calls or save data to BigQuery.

## Key Files
1. `env.py`: Provides utility functions for managing environment variables, including determining if the current environment is production and retrieving environment variables with optional default values.

2. `gcp.py`: Contains a mock GCP (Google Cloud Platform) class with methods for retrieving secrets and saving data to BigQuery. This file simulates interactions with GCP services and would be replaced with actual GCP interactions in a production environment.

These files support the main functionality by providing environment management and simulated cloud service interactions.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several external libraries:

1. FastAPI: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
2. httpx: An asynchronous HTTP client library used for making API requests to Metriport.
3. pydantic: A data validation and settings management library used for defining data models and validating webhook payloads.
4. python-dotenv: Used for loading environment variables from a .env file.

These dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file located in the parent `samples` directory.

## Configuration
The project uses environment variables for configuration, which are loaded from a `.env` file. Key configuration options include:

- `IS_PROD`: Determines if the environment is production.
- `METRIPORT_SECRET_KEY`: The API key for authenticating with Metriport.
- `METRIPORT_FACILITY_ID`: The facility ID for Metriport operations.
- `WH_KEY`: The webhook key for verifying incoming webhook signatures.
- `PATIENT_ID`: The Metriport patient ID used in webhook processing.

Additionally, the code defines constants for Metriport API URLs:
- `_METRIPORT_SANDBOX_URL`: "https://api.sandbox.metriport.com/"
- `_METRIPORT_PROD_URL`: "https://api.metriport.com/"

To set up and run the project:
1. Create a Python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r samples/requirements.txt`
4. Run the FastAPI webhook server: `uvicorn mock-webhook:app --reload --port 8088`
5. Use ngrok to expose the local server: `ngrok http 8088`
6. Update the Metriport dashboard with the ngrok URL and copy the `metriport_wh_key` to your `.env` file.

To create a patient and trigger a webhook, run: `python3 -m create_patient_trigger_webhook`

This setup allows developers to quickly start working with the Metriport API and test webhook functionality in a local development environment.
