title: "launch.json"
---

## High-level description
This `launch.json` file configures Visual Studio Code's debugging and running capabilities for a project that includes an API and a widget. It defines multiple launch configurations for running and debugging the API in different environments (local Node.js and Docker) and running the widget in Chrome.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single JSON object with a "version" field and a "configurations" array. Each item in the "configurations" array represents a different launch configuration for various parts of the project.

## Symbols

### Configuration: "Run API"
#### Description
This configuration runs the API in development mode using npm.

#### Internal Logic
It uses the "node-terminal" type to execute the npm command `npm run dev -w packages/api` in a terminal window.

### Configuration: "Run & Debug API"
#### Description
This configuration runs and enables debugging for the API in development mode.

#### Internal Logic
It uses the Node.js debugger to launch the API, running the `npm run-script dev` command in the `packages/api` directory. The output is displayed in the integrated terminal.

### Configuration: "Debug API - Attach to Node"
#### Description
This configuration allows attaching the debugger to a running Node.js process for the API.

#### Internal Logic
It attaches to a Node.js process running on localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 9229.

### Configuration: "Debug API - Attach to Docker"
#### Description
This configuration enables debugging the API running inside a Docker container.

#### Internal Logic
It attaches to a Node.js process running in a Docker container at 0.0.0.0:9229. It includes source map path overrides to map the container's file system to the local workspace, facilitating proper source mapping during debugging.

### Configuration: "Run Widget in Chrome"
#### Description
This configuration launches the widget in Google Chrome for debugging.

#### Internal Logic
It opens Chrome and navigates to `http://localhost:3001`, setting the web root to the `packages/connect-widget/` directory in the workspace.

## Dependencies
The configurations implicitly depend on the following tools and environments:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Node.js | Running and debugging the API |
| npm | Package management and running scripts |
| Docker | Running the API in a containerized environment |
| Google Chrome | Debugging the widget |

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for VS Code's debug and run capabilities. Each configuration in the "configurations" array can be selected and run from the VS Code Debug view.

## Error Handling
This configuration file does not implement explicit error handling. Any errors that occur during the execution of these configurations would be handled by VS Code's debugging interface or the respective runtime environments (Node.js, Chrome, etc.).

This `launch.json` file provides a comprehensive set of debugging and running options for different components of the project, allowing developers to easily switch between debugging the API (both locally and in Docker) and the widget in Chrome.
