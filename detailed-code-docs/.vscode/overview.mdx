## High-level description
This `.vscode` directory contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that customize the development environment for a project involving an API, a widget, and potentially Java components. The directory includes two key files: `launch.json` and `settings.json`, which together provide a comprehensive setup for debugging, running, and customizing the VS Code workspace for this project.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory accomplish several important tasks:

1. They set up multiple ways to run and debug the API, both locally and in a Docker container.
2. They provide a configuration to run and debug the widget in Google Chrome.
3. They customize the VS Code environment, including UI elements, TypeScript configuration, and GitHub pull request settings.
4. They configure Java build settings for automatic updates.

These configurations allow developers to easily switch between different debugging scenarios, ensure consistent TypeScript usage across the team, and customize their VS Code environment for optimal productivity.

## Key Files

### 1. launch.json
This file defines multiple launch configurations for running and debugging different parts of the project:

- "Run API": Runs the API in development mode using npm.
- "Run & Debug API": Runs and enables debugging for the API in development mode.
- "Debug API - Attach to Node": Allows attaching the debugger to a running Node.js process for the API.
- "Debug API - Attach to Docker": Enables debugging the API running inside a Docker container.
- "Run Widget in Chrome": Launches the widget in Google Chrome for debugging.

These configurations use various debugging types (node-terminal, node, chrome) and specify different commands and settings to facilitate debugging in different environments.

### 2. settings.json
This file customizes the VS Code workspace with several important settings:

- Disables automatic cloaking of environment variables.
- Customizes the status bar color to a specific blue shade (#007acc).
- Specifies the TypeScript SDK path to use the local installation in the project's node_modules directory.
- Configures the GitHub Pull Requests extension to ignore pull requests targeting the "develop" branch.
- Sets the Java build configuration to update automatically when changes are detected.

## Dependencies
The configurations in these files imply the use of several tools and VS Code extensions:

1. Node.js and npm: For running and debugging the API.
2. Docker: For running the API in a containerized environment.
3. Google Chrome: For debugging the widget.
4. TypeScript: Used for type-checking in the project.
5. GitHub Pull Requests extension: For integration with GitHub pull requests.
6. Java extension pack: For Java development support.

## Configuration
The `settings.json` file serves as the main configuration for the VS Code workspace. Here are the key configurations:

```json
{
  "dotenv.enableAutocloaking": false,
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "statusBar.background": "#007acc"
  },
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "githubPullRequests.ignoredPullRequestBranches": ["develop"],
  "java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration": "automatic"
}
```

The `launch.json` file provides multiple debug configurations that can be selected and run from the VS Code Debug view. These configurations allow developers to easily switch between debugging the API (both locally and in Docker) and the widget in Chrome.

In summary, the `.vscode` directory provides a well-structured and comprehensive set of configurations that streamline the development process, enhance debugging capabilities, and ensure consistency across the development team for this multi-component project.
