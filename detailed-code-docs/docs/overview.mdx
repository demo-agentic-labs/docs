2. Offers guides on accessing patient medical data, health device integrations, and EHR interfacing.

3. Explains FHIR resources used in the Medical API, including their properties and search parameters.

4. Guides developers through the process of getting started with both APIs, from account creation to making API requests.

5. Provides information on advanced features such as webhooks, error handling, and sandbox environments for testing.

6. Includes reusable code snippets and examples to assist developers in implementing Metriport's services.

7. Offers configuration details for the documentation website itself.

5. `docs/guides/`: Includes guides on accessing patient data, health device integrations, and EHR interfacing.

6. `docs/home/`: Contains the welcome page and general API information such as authentication and error handling.

## Dependencies

The documentation mentions several key dependencies:

1. Metriport SDK (@metriport/api-sdk): Used for easy integration with the Medical API in Node.js applications.

2. FHIR R4 specification (version 4.0.1): The Medical API follows this standard for healthcare data interoperability.

3. Node.js: Required for using the Metriport SDK.

4. Mintlify: The documentation is generated and hosted using Mintlify.

## Configuration

The documentation covers several configuration aspects:

1. API Key: Required for authentication when making API requests or initializing the SDK.

2. Webhook URL: Can be configured for receiving asynchronous notifications about events like document availability.

3. Sandbox Mode: Can be enabled for testing and development purposes.

4. SDK Initialization:
   ```javascript
   import { MetriportMedicalApi } from "@metriport/api-sdk";
   const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY", { sandbox: true });
   ```

5. Documentation Website Configuration: Defined in `docs/mint.json`, including settings for the website's name, logo, colors, navigation structure, and other UI elements.

This comprehensive documentation provides developers with all the necessary information to understand, implement, and utilize Metriport's Medical API and Converter API effectively in their healthcare applications.
