## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of code snippets and reusable components used in the documentation for a medical API. The snippets are primarily written in MDX format, which allows for the combination of Markdown and JSX.

## What does it do?
The snippets in this directory serve as building blocks for the API documentation. They provide standardized descriptions, examples, and explanations for various aspects of the API, such as:

1. Data structures (e.g., patient demographics, addresses)
2. API responses (e.g., facility responses, patient responses)
3. Code examples for API initialization and usage
4. Webhook handling and metadata
5. Configuration snippets for different programming languages and frameworks

These snippets can be easily included and reused across different parts of the documentation, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication of content.

## Key Files
1. `demographics.mdx`: Defines the structure for patient demographic information, including personal identifiers, address, and contact details.

2. `patient-response.mdx` and `patient-response-json.mdx`: Provide the structure and an example of a patient response from the API.

3. `facility-response.mdx` and `facility-response-json.mdx`: Describe the structure and provide an example of a facility response from the API.

4. `medical-api-init.mdx` and `medical-api-init-with-options.mdx`: Contain code snippets for initializing the Metriport Medical API client.

5. `webhook-signature-validation.mdx`: Provides an example of how to validate webhook signatures.

6. `devices-api-query-params.mdx`: Describes the query parameters used in the Devices API.

7. `document-progress.mdx`, `document-progress-download.mdx`, and `document-progress-convert.mdx`: Describe the structure of document progress responses for downloading and converting medical documents.

8. `consolidated-query.mdx`: Defines the structure of a consolidated query response.

These snippets work together to provide a comprehensive and consistent set of documentation components for the medical API. They can be easily imported and used in various parts of the main documentation, allowing for modular and maintainable documentation structure.

## Configuration
The snippets use various custom components and styles, which are likely defined elsewhere in the documentation system. These include:

- `&lt;ResponseField&gt;`: Used to describe API response fields
- `&lt;ParamField&gt;`: Used to describe API request parameters
- `&lt;Expandable&gt;`: Used to create collapsible sections
- `&lt;Info&gt;`: Used to display informational notes
- `&lt;Warning&gt;`: Used to display warning messages
- `&lt;Tip&gt;`: Used to display helpful tips

These components enhance the readability and interactivity of the documentation.
