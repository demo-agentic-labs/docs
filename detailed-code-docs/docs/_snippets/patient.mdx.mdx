&lt;Tip&gt;
  The more demographic information you can provide about a Patient, the higher chances Metriport will be
  able to find a match. For example: nicknames, old addresses, multiple phone numbers, a pre-marital
  last name, etc.
&lt;/Tip&gt;

&lt;Snippet file="demographics.mdx" /&gt;

&lt;ParamField body="externalId" type="string"&gt;
  An external Patient ID to associate to a Patient in Metriport.
&lt;/ParamField&gt;

&lt;Info&gt;
  If the optional `externalId` param is provided, you can expect to see it returned in the responses
  involving the Patient. It will also be included within the webhook payloads.
&lt;/Info&gt;
