## High-level description

This file, `docs/mint.json`, is a configuration file for a documentation website. It defines the structure, navigation, and appearance of the Metriport API documentation. The file contains settings for the website's name, logo, API endpoints, colors, navigation structure, and various other UI elements.

## Code Structure

The JSON object in this file contains several top-level keys that define different aspects of the documentation website:

- General information (name, logo, favicon)
- API configuration (baseUrl, authentication method)

The `navigation` array is the largest and most complex part of the file, defining the hierarchical structure of the documentation pages.
