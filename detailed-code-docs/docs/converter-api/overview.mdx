## High-level description

The "docs/converter-api" directory contains documentation for Metriport's FHIR Converter API, which allows users to convert C-CDA (Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) R4 format. The documentation covers the API reference, getting started guide, and additional information about the sandbox mode.

## What does it do?

The FHIR Converter API provides a service that takes C-CDA documents as input and converts them into FHIR R4 resources. This conversion process allows healthcare organizations and developers to transform their existing C-CDA data into the more modern and interoperable FHIR format. The API accepts C-CDA XML documents via a POST request and returns a FHIR R4 Bundle containing the converted resources.

The documentation in this directory guides users through the process of setting up an account, obtaining API keys, making API requests, and understanding the sandbox environment for testing and development purposes.

## Key Files

1. api-reference:
   This file contains the API reference documentation for the Convert C-CDA to FHIR endpoint. It details the request format, including the required XML body and query parameters, as well as the expected response format. The file provides examples of both the input C-CDA document and the output FHIR R4 Bundle.

2. getting-started:
   This file provides a step-by-step guide for users to get started with the FHIR Converter API. It covers creating a developer account, generating an API key, making a sample API request to convert C-CDA to FHIR, and requesting production access.

3. more-info:
   This file contains additional information about the Sandbox mode, which allows developers to build and test their applications using example clinical data. It explains how to toggle between Sandbox and Production modes and provides warnings about the limitations of Sandbox mode.

## Configuration

The documentation mentions the use of API keys for authentication. Users need to generate an API key through the Metriport dashboard to access the Converter API. The API key should be treated as sensitive information and kept secure.

The API also uses a query parameter `patientId` to specify the internal identifier for the patient associated with the C-CDA document being converted. This parameter is required and is used to populate patient-related references in the returned FHIR Bundle.

## Dependencies

The documentation doesn't explicitly mention any external dependencies. However, it's clear that the API works with the following standards and formats:

1. C-CDA (Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture) R2.1: The input format for the documents to be converted.
2. FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) R4: The output format of the converted data.
3. XML: The input C-CDA documents are in XML format.
4. JSON: The output FHIR R4 Bundle is in JSON format.

## Entry points

The main entry point for developers using the FHIR Converter API is the POST endpoint `/convert/v1/ccda/to/fhir`. This endpoint accepts a C-CDA XML document in the request body and returns a FHIR R4 Bundle containing the converted resources.

The documentation is organized to guide users through the process of using the API:

1. The "getting-started" file provides an overview and step-by-step instructions for new users.
2. The "api-reference" file offers detailed information about the API endpoint, request format, and response structure.
3. The "more-info" file provides additional context about the Sandbox mode for testing and development.

Data flow in the API is straightforward:
1. The client sends a C-CDA XML document to the API endpoint.
2. The API processes the document and converts it to FHIR R4 format.
3. The API returns a FHIR R4 Bundle containing the converted resources.

Control flow is managed through the use of API keys for authentication and the `patientId` query parameter for associating the converted data with a specific patient.
