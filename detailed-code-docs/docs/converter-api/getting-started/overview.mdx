## Overview

Getting started with our FHIR Converter API is pretty easy, you'll just need take the following steps:

1. [Create a developer account](#1-create-a-developer-account).
1. [Generate an API key](#2-generate-an-api-key).
1. [Convert C-CDA to FHIR](#3-convert-c-cda-to-fhir).
1. [Request Production access](#4-request-api-access).


Let's get into it! ðŸ¤˜

## 1. Create a developer account

&lt;Snippet file="create-dev-account.mdx" /&gt;

---

## 2. Generate an API key

Once you've created an account and confirmed your email, you'll be taken to the [dashboard
home page](https://dash.metriport.com/). From here, take the following steps to get your API key:

- Toggle the `Sandbox` switch in the Dashboard navbar to enter `Sandbox` mode (learn more about this [here](/converter-api/more-info/sandbox)).
- In the left hand menu, click `Developers`.
- On the Developers page, you'll be able to click the "Generate Secret Key" button.

&lt;Info&gt;
  This Secret Key will allow you to start making requests to the Metriport API.
  Treat this like a password, and keep it somewhere safe! You can read the [API
  Keys](/home/api-info/api-keys) page to learn more about API key security best practices.
&lt;/Info&gt;

&lt;Tip&gt;
  If you believe your key has been compromised, you can always revoke it and then generate a new one
  on the Developers page by clicking the trash button beside the key.
&lt;/Tip&gt;

## 3. Convert C-CDA to FHIR

Essentially, you'll just need to send a `POST` request to the [Convert C-CDA to FHIR endpoint](/converter-api/api-reference/ccda/ccda-to-fhir),
with the body containing a valid C-CDA (R2.1) XML document to convert:


```xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;ClinicalDocument xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3"&gt;
    &lt;!-- contents --&gt;
&lt;/ClinicalDocument&gt;
```

&lt;Tip&gt;
  You can use [this example C-CDA from HL7](https://github.com/HL7/CDA-ccda-2.1/blob/master/examples/C-CDA_R2-1_CCD.xml) for testing purposes.
&lt;/Tip&gt;

Since C-CDAs correspond to a particular patient, you should also specify the `patientId` query param to match your patient's identifier. 

You'll get back a [FHIR R4 Bundle](/medical-api/fhir/resources/bundle) back, with `entry` containing an array of FHIR R4 Resources being the outcome of the conversion.

```json
{
    "resourceType": "Bundle",
    "type": "batch",
    "entry": [
        {
            "fullUrl": "urn:uuid:adc44b9c-3083-396f-877f-463120f6b26a",
            "resource": {
                "resourceType": "Location",
                "id": "adc44b9c-3083-396f-877f-463120f6b26a",
                "name": "Good Health Urgent Care"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

See the [Convert C-CDA to FHIR endpoint](/converter-api/api-reference/ccda/ccda-to-fhir) in our API reference for more details.

## 4. Request Production access ðŸš€

To start using the Convert API for production workloads, you can take the following steps to request production API access:

- In the left hand menu, click `Products & Billing`.
- Click `Get Started` on the Converter API product.
- Press `Book an Intro Call` and select a time and a date to talk to us.

After the call, we will promptly setup your account for production access.

## Wrapping up

That's it! ðŸ¤˜

You're now well equiped to use the Metriport Converter API to convert healthcare data to various standards.

For next steps, we'd recommend scoping out our [Converter API Reference](/converter-api/api-reference/ccda/ccda-to-fhir)
in further detail to see the other things you can do with the API.
