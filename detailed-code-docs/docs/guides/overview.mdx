## High-level description
The "docs/guides" directory contains documentation guides for various aspects of the Metriport platform. These guides provide information on accessing patient medical data, health device integrations, and seamless EHR interfacing. The content is structured in a user-friendly format, using Markdown with extended syntax (MDX) to include interactive elements and visual aids.

## What does it do?
This directory serves as a resource for developers and users of the Metriport platform, offering guidance on:

1. Accessing patient medical data: It explains how to retrieve medical data with or without an NPI number, emphasizing the platform's open-source nature, HIPAA and SOC 2 compliance, and flexible pricing plans.

2. Health device integrations: Although the content is marked as "Coming Soon," it promises to provide information on connecting to various wearables, RPM devices, and mHealth apps through a standardized API.

3. EHR interfacing: It outlines the capability to read and write to common Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems like Epic, Athena, and Allscripts, with native FHIR support.

These guides aim to help developers understand and utilize Metriport's features effectively, promoting interoperability and ease of use in healthcare technology integration.

## Key Files
1. `access.mdx`: This file focuses on accessing patient medical data. It highlights the platform's open-source nature, startup-friendly approach, and compliance with HIPAA and SOC 2 standards. Key points include:
   - Open source technology for enhanced security and development speed
   - Flexible pricing plans, including pay-per-use and self-hosting options
   - HIPAA and SOC 2 compliant API for secure handling of Protected Health Information (PHI)

2. `integrations.mdx`: This file is a placeholder for upcoming content on health device integrations. While the main content is not yet available, it promises to cover:
   - Connecting to wearables, RPM devices, and mHealth apps
   - Using a single standardized API for various integrations
   - Eliminating the need for writing proprietary integrations

3. `interfacing.mdx`: This file provides information on EHR interfacing capabilities. It includes:
   - An accordion group for different EHR systems (Epic, Athena, Allscripts)
   - Native FHIR support for healthcare interoperability
   - Ability to read and write to common EHR systems

Each file uses a combination of text, images, and interactive elements to convey information effectively.

## Configuration
The MDX files in this directory use frontmatter for configuration. Each file includes the following fields:

- `title`: The main title of the guide
- `description`: A brief summary of the guide's content

For example, in `access.mdx`:

```yaml
---
title: "Access Patient Medical Data"
description: "Access your users' medical data, with or without an NPI number. Get the data you need to grow and scale quickly, leveraging our data sharing partners."
---
```

These configuration fields are likely used to generate metadata for the documentation site and provide quick summaries for navigation purposes.
