## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) related endpoints in the Metriport Medical API. It covers various operations related to patient data, including querying consolidated data, counting resources, creating consolidated data, and managing medical record summaries.

## What does it do?

The FHIR API endpoints in this directory allow developers to:

1. Count a patient's data per resource type, optionally filtered by date range.
2. Query and retrieve a patient's consolidated data asynchronously, with options for filtering by resource types and date range.
3. Create or update a patient's consolidated data using FHIR Bundles.
4. Generate and retrieve Medical Record Summaries in PDF or HTML formats.
5. Check the status of Medical Record Summary generation.

These endpoints enable applications to interact with patient health data in a standardized FHIR format, facilitating interoperability and comprehensive health record management.

## Entry points

The main entry points for the FHIR API are:

1. `GET /medical/v1/patient/{id}/consolidated/count`: Count patient data resources.
2. `GET /medical/v1/patient/{id}/consolidated/query`: Get status of consolidated data queries.
3. `POST /medical/v1/patient/{id}/consolidated/query`: Start a new consolidated data query.
4. `PUT /medical/v1/patient/{id}/consolidated`: Create or update patient's consolidated data.
5. `GET /patient/:id/medical-record-status`: Check status of Medical Record Summary generation.
6. `GET /patient/:id/medical-record`: Retrieve Medical Record Summary in PDF or HTML format.

These endpoints provide a comprehensive set of operations for managing and retrieving patient health data in FHIR format.

## Key Files

1. `consolidated-data-count.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for counting patient data resources.
2. `consolidated-data-query-get.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve the status of consolidated data queries.
3. `consolidated-data-query-post.mdx`: Explains how to initiate a new consolidated data query.
4. `create-patient-consolidated.mdx`: Details the process of creating or updating a patient's consolidated data.
5. `get-medical-record-summary-status.mdx`: Covers checking the status of Medical Record Summary generation.
6. `get-medical-record-summary.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve the Medical Record Summary.

These files provide detailed documentation for each FHIR-related endpoint, including request parameters, response formats, and example usage.

## Dependencies

The API documentation references the Metriport SDK, specifically the `MetriportMedicalApi` class, which is used to interact with the Metriport Medical API. The exact version of the SDK is not specified in the provided documentation.

## Configuration

The API endpoints use the following configuration:

1. API Token: Required for authentication, passed when initializing the `MetriportMedicalApi` instance.
2. Webhook URL: Configured separately for receiving asynchronous responses from consolidated data queries.

Environment variables or specific configuration files are not mentioned in the provided documentation.

The API supports various query parameters for filtering and customizing requests, such as:

- `resources`: Comma-separated list of FHIR resource types to include in queries.
- `dateFrom` and `dateTo`: ISO 8601 formatted dates for filtering resources by date range.
- `conversionType`: Specifies the format for Medical Record Summaries (PDF or HTML).

These configuration options allow for flexible and targeted retrieval of patient health data in FHIR format.
