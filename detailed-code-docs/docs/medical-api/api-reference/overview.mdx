## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for the Metriport Medical API. It covers various aspects of healthcare data management, including patient records, medical documents, facilities, organizations, and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data handling. The API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting healthcare-related information.

## What does it do?
The Metriport Medical API enables developers to:

1. Manage patient records: Create, retrieve, update, and delete patient information, as well as match patients based on demographic data.
2. Handle medical documents: Query, download, upload, and list medical documents associated with patients.
3. Manage healthcare facilities: Create, retrieve, update, and delete facility information, as well as list facilities associated with an organization.
4. Manage organizations: Create, retrieve, and update organization details within the Metriport system.
5. Work with FHIR data: Query consolidated patient data, count resources, create or update consolidated data, and manage medical record summaries.

These functionalities allow healthcare applications to efficiently manage and access patient information, medical documents, and organizational data while ensuring interoperability through FHIR standards.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the Metriport Medical API are organized into several categories:

1. Patient API:
   - POST /medical/v1/patient: Create a new patient record
   - GET /medical/v1/patient/{id}: Retrieve patient information
   - PUT /medical/v1/patient/{id}: Update patient information
   - DELETE /medical/v1/patient/{id}: Delete a patient record
   - GET /medical/v1/facility/{facilityId}/patients: List patients at a facility
   - POST /medical/v1/patient/match: Match a patient based on demographic data

2. Document API:
   - POST /medical/v1/patient/{patientId}/document/query: Start a document query
   - GET /medical/v1/patient/{patientId}/document/query/{queryId}: Get document query status
   - GET /medical/v1/patient/{patientId}/document/{documentId}: Get a document download URL
   - GET /medical/v1/patient/{patientId}/documents: List patient documents
   - POST /medical/v1/patient/{patientId}/document: Upload a document

3. Facility API:
   - POST /medical/v1/facility: Create a new facility
   - GET /medical/v1/facility/{id}: Retrieve facility information
   - PUT /medical/v1/facility/{id}: Update facility information
   - DELETE /medical/v1/facility/{id}: Delete a facility
   - GET /medical/v1/facilities: List all facilities

4. Organization API:
   - POST /medical/v1/organization: Create a new organization
   - GET /medical/v1/organization: Retrieve organization information
   - PUT /medical/v1/organization/{id}: Update organization details

5. FHIR API:
   - GET /medical/v1/patient/{id}/consolidated/count: Count patient data resources
   - GET /medical/v1/patient/{id}/consolidated/query: Get status of consolidated data queries
   - POST /medical/v1/patient/{id}/consolidated/query: Start a new consolidated data query
   - PUT /medical/v1/patient/{id}/consolidated: Create or update patient's consolidated data
   - GET /patient/:id/medical-record-status: Check status of Medical Record Summary generation
   - GET /patient/:id/medical-record: Retrieve Medical Record Summary

## Dependencies
The API documentation references the Metriport SDK, specifically the `@metriport/api-sdk` package. This SDK is used in code examples to demonstrate how to interact with the API endpoints programmatically. The SDK provides a `MetriportMedicalApi` class for easy integration with the API.

## Configuration
The API requires an API key for authentication. This key is used when initializing the `MetriportMedicalApi` instance:

```javascript
import { MetriportMedicalApi } from "@metriport/api-sdk";

const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

Some endpoints, particularly those related to document handling, may require a configured webhook URL for receiving asynchronous notifications. This can be set up at `/home/api-reference/settings/post-settings`.

The API uses standard RESTful conventions and supports various query parameters for filtering and customizing requests. For example, the FHIR endpoints allow filtering by resource types and date ranges.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of creating a patient using the Metriport SDK:

```javascript
const patient = await metriport.createPatient(
  {
    firstName: "Jose",
    lastName: "Juarez",
    dob: "1951-05-05",
    genderAtBirth: "M",
    personalIdentifiers: [
      {
        type: "driversLicense",
        state: USState.CA,
        value: "51227265",
      },
    ],
    address: [
      {
        zip: "12345",
        city: "San Diego",
        state: USState.CA,
        country: "USA",
        addressLine1: "Guadalajara Street",
      },
    ],
    contact: [
      {
        phone: "1234567899",
        email: "jose@domain.com",
      },
    ],
    externalId: "123456789",
  },
  facilityId
);
```

This example demonstrates the structure of patient data and how to use the SDK to create a new patient record associated with a specific facility.

The Metriport Medical API provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing healthcare data, enabling developers to build robust and interoperable healthcare applications.
