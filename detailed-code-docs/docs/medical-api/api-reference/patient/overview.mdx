## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for patient-related operations in the Metriport Medical API. It covers various endpoints for managing patient data, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting patient records, as well as matching patients based on demographic data.

## What does it do?
The patient API endpoints allow developers to perform the following actions:

1. Create a new patient record associated with a specific facility.
2. Retrieve patient information by ID.
3. Update existing patient information.
4. Delete a patient record.
5. List all patients receiving care at a specific facility.
6. Match a patient based on demographic data.

These operations enable healthcare applications to manage patient data efficiently, ensuring that patient information is accurately stored, retrieved, and maintained within the Metriport system.

## Key Files
1. `create-patient.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating a new patient record.
2. `get-patient.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve patient information by ID.
3. `update-patient.mdx`: Explains the process of updating existing patient information.
4. `delete-patient.mdx`: Details the endpoint for removing a patient record.
5. `list-patients.mdx`: Covers the API call for listing all patients at a specific facility.
6. `match-patient.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for matching a patient based on demographic data.

Each file provides detailed information about the respective API endpoint, including required parameters, request body structure, and response format.

## Dependencies
The API documentation references the Metriport SDK, specifically the `@metriport/api-sdk` package. This SDK is used in the code examples to demonstrate how to interact with the API endpoints using JavaScript.

## Configuration
The API endpoints require an API key for authentication. This key is passed to the `MetriportMedicalApi` constructor when initializing the SDK:

```javascript
const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

Each API endpoint may require additional parameters, such as:

1. `facilityId`: The ID of the facility where the patient is receiving care.
2. `id`: The unique identifier of a patient.

These parameters are passed either as query parameters, path parameters, or in the request body, depending on the specific endpoint.

The patient data structure includes the following main fields:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the patient
- `facilityIds`: Array of facility IDs where the patient receives care
- `firstName`: Patient's first name
- `lastName`: Patient's last name
- `dob`: Date of birth
- `genderAtBirth`: Gender at birth (e.g., "M" or "F")
- `personalIdentifiers`: Array of personal identification documents
- `address`: Array of patient addresses
- `contact`: Array of contact information (phone, email)
- `externalId`: External identifier for the patient

Here's an example of creating a patient using the SDK:

```javascript
const patient = await metriport.createPatient(
  {
    firstName: "Jose",
    lastName: "Juarez",
    dob: "1951-05-05",
    genderAtBirth: "M",
    personalIdentifiers: [
      {
        type: "driversLicense",
        state: USState.CA,
        value: "51227265",
      },
    ],
    address: [
      {
        zip: "12345",
        city: "San Diego",
        state: USState.CA,
        country: "USA",
        addressLine1: "Guadalajara Street",
      },
    ],
    contact: [
      {
        phone: "1234567899",
        email: "jose@domain.com",
      },
    ],
    externalId: "123456789",
  },
  facilityId
);
```

This API documentation provides developers with the necessary information to integrate patient management functionality into their applications using the Metriport Medical API.
