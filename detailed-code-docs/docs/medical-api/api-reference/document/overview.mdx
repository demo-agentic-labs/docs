## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for document-related operations in a medical API. It includes endpoints for querying, downloading, uploading, and listing medical documents associated with patients.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides documentation for various API endpoints that allow developers to:

1. Start a bulk process to generate download URLs for all of a patient's documents.
2. Check the status of a document query for a specific patient.
3. Get a downloadable URL for a specific document.
4. List all available documents for a patient, with optional filtering.
5. Upload a new medical document for a patient.
6. Start a document query process across Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) for a specific patient.

These endpoints enable developers to manage and access medical documents within the system, facilitating the retrieval, storage, and processing of patient-related medical information.

## Key Files

1. `download-url-bulk.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for starting a bulk process to generate download URLs for all of a patient's documents.

2. `get-document-query.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for checking the status of a document query for a specific patient.

3. `get-document.mdx`: Explains how to get a downloadable URL for a specific document.

4. `list-documents.mdx`: Details the endpoint for listing all available documents for a patient, including filtering options.

5. `post-upload-url.mdx`: Provides information on how to upload a new medical document for a patient.

6. `start-document-query.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for initiating a document query process across HIEs for a specific patient.

## Dependencies
The documentation mentions the use of the Metriport SDK, specifically the `MetriportMedicalApi` class, for interacting with the API endpoints. The SDK is likely an external library provided by Metriport to simplify API interactions.

## Configuration
The documentation refers to a configured webhook URL, which can be set up at `/home/api-reference/settings/post-settings`. This URL is used to receive notifications about the status of various document-related processes.

Additionally, an API key is required to authenticate requests to the API endpoints. This key should be provided when initializing the `MetriportMedicalApi` instance.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how to use the Metriport SDK to start a document query:

```javascript
import { MetriportMedicalApi } from "@metriport/api-sdk";

const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");

const metadata = {
  youCan: "putAny",
  stringKeyValue: "pairsHere",
};

const status = await metriport.startDocumentQuery(
  "018a80c4-292a-7486-a1234-76yuhe23yu14", // Patient
  "018a80c4-292a-7486-a1234-9uiu76yhe234", // Facility
  metadata
);
```

This code initializes the SDK with an API key, sets up some metadata, and then calls the `startDocumentQuery` method with a patient ID, facility ID, and the metadata.

The documentation provides similar code snippets for each endpoint, demonstrating how to use the SDK to interact with the API.
