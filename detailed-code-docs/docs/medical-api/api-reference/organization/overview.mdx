## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for organization-related operations in the Metriport Medical API. It covers the creation, retrieval, and updating of organization details within the Metriport system.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides documentation and examples for three main operations:

1. Creating a new organization: This allows users to register their organization in Metriport by providing details such as the organization type, name, and location.

2. Retrieving organization information: Users can fetch the details of their registered organization, which represents their legal corporate entity in the Metriport system.

3. Updating organization details: This operation allows users to modify the information of an existing organization, such as changing the name, type, or location.

These operations are essential for managing an organization's presence within the Metriport ecosystem, enabling users to maintain accurate and up-to-date information about their entity.

## Key Files
1. create-organization.mdx: 
   - Describes the API endpoint for creating a new organization.
   - Provides details on the required request body and expected response.
   - Includes an example using the Metriport SDK to create an organization.

2. get-organization.mdx:
   - Documents the API endpoint for retrieving organization information.
   - Explains the response structure for organization details.
   - Provides an example of how to use the Metriport SDK to fetch organization data.

3. update-organization.mdx:
   - Outlines the API endpoint for updating an existing organization's details.
   - Specifies the required path parameters, request body, and expected response.
   - Includes an example of updating an organization using the Metriport SDK.

## Dependencies
The documentation references the Metriport API SDK, specifically the `@metriport/api-sdk` package. This SDK is used in the code examples to demonstrate how to interact with the Metriport API for organization-related operations.

Key components from the SDK used in the examples include:
- `MetriportMedicalApi`: The main class for interacting with the Metriport Medical API.
- `OrgType`: An enumeration of organization types.
- `USState`: An enumeration of US states.

## Configuration
The examples in the documentation use an API key for authentication. Users are expected to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with their actual Metriport API key when using the SDK.

Example configuration:

```javascript
const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

The API endpoints documented in this directory are:
- POST /medical/v1/organization (Create Organization)
- GET /medical/v1/organization (Get Organization)
- PUT /medical/v1/organization/{id} (Update Organization)

These endpoints require appropriate authentication and authorization to access.

Code snippets in the documentation showcase the structure of requests and responses for each operation. For example, the create organization request body structure:

```javascript
{
  type: OrgType.postAcuteCare,
  name: "Metriport Inc.",
  location: {
    addressLine1: "2261 Market Street",
    addressLine2: "#4818",
    city: "San Francisco",
    state: USState.CA,
    zip: "94114",
    country: "USA",
  }
}
```

This structure is consistent across create and update operations, with the update operation requiring an additional `id` parameter in the path.

The documentation also includes response examples, typically in JSON format, to illustrate the structure of the data returned by the API for each operation.
