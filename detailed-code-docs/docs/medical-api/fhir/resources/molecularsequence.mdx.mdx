| chromosome-variant-coordinate     | composite | Search parameter by chromosome and variant coordinate. This will refer to part of a locus or part of a gene where search region will be represented in 1-based system. Since the coordinateSystem can either be 0-based or 1-based, this search query will include the result of both coordinateSystem that contains the equivalent segment of the gene or whole genome sequence. For example, a search for sequence can be represented as `chromosome-variant-coordinate=1$lt345$gt123`, this means it will search for the MolecularSequence resource with variants on chromosome 1 and with position &gt;123 and &lt;345, where in 1-based system resource, all strings within region 1:124-344 will be revealed, while in 0-based system resource, all strings within region 1:123-344 will be revealed. You may want to check detail about 0-based v.s. 1-based above.                                              | MolecularSequence.variant                     |
| chromosome-window-coordinate      | composite | Search parameter by chromosome and window. This will refer to part of a locus or part of a gene where search region will be represented in 1-based system. Since the coordinateSystem can either be 0-based or 1-based, this search query will include the result of both coordinateSystem that contains the equivalent segment of the gene or whole genome sequence. For example, a search for sequence can be represented as `chromosome-window-coordinate=1$lt345$gt123`, this means it will search for the MolecularSequence resource with a window on chromosome 1 and with position &gt;123 and &lt;345, where in 1-based system resource, all strings within region 1:124-344 will be revealed, while in 0-based system resource, all strings within region 1:123-344 will be revealed.

| referenceseqid-variant-coordinate | composite | Search parameter by reference sequence and variant coordinate. This will refer to part of a locus or part of a gene where search region will be represented in 1-based system. Since the coordinateSystem can either be 0-based or 1-based, this search query will include the result of both coordinateSystem that contains the equivalent segment of the gene or whole genome sequence. For example, a search for sequence can be represented as `referenceSeqId-variant-coordinate=NC_000001.11$lt345$gt123`, this means it will search for the MolecularSequence resource with variants on NC_000001.11 and with position &gt;123 and &lt;345, where in 1-based system resource, all strings within region NC_000001.11:124-344 will be revealed, while in 0-based system resource, all strings within region NC_000001.11:123-344 will be revealed.
