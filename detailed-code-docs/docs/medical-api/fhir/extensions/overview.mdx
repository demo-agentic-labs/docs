In some cases, when querying for FHIR Resources, you may want to download the Document
corresponding to a Resource - you can use the information found in this extension to
do so.

For example, this is helpful to answer questions such as "what Progress Note does this Encounter
correspond to?".

## Properties

Example extension:

```json
{
  "url": "https://public.metriport.com/fhir/StructureDefinition/doc-id-extension.json",
  "valueString": "1A5512D2-0EE9-11EE-B2A6-A2F55214B7C1-MLKJ392874kjshhKJSHDFdskjfh98234uiy"
}
```

&lt;Tip&gt;
  You can use the value of the `valueString` property as input to the [Get Document URL
  endpoint](/medical-api/api-reference/document/get-document) to download the C-CDA Document from
  which the FHIR Resource was derived from.
&lt;/Tip&gt;

&lt;ResponseField name="url" type="string" required&gt;
  The URL of this extension's JSON structure specification.
&lt;/ResponseField&gt;

&lt;ResponseField name="valueString" type="string" required&gt;
  The ID of the C-CDA Document the FHIR Resource was derived from.
&lt;/ResponseField&gt;
