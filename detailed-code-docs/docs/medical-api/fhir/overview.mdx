## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the FHIR resources used in the medical API. Each file corresponds to a specific FHIR resource and provides detailed information about its properties, search parameters, and inherited properties.

## What does it do?

This directory serves as a comprehensive reference guide for developers working with the medical API. It provides detailed specifications for each FHIR resource, including:

- Resource properties and their descriptions
- Required vs optional fields
- Data types used
- Search parameters supported for querying the resource
- Inherited properties from the base Resource type

This allows developers to understand the structure and capabilities of each resource when building applications that interact with the API.

## Key Files

Some of the most important resource definitions include:

- patient.mdx - Defines the Patient resource for representing demographic and other administrative information about an individual receiving care
- observation.mdx - Specifies the Observation resource for measurements and simple assertions made about a patient
- condition.mdx - Details the Condition resource for recording detailed information about a patient's condition/problem/diagnosis
- medicationrequest.mdx - Describes the MedicationRequest resource for ordering or requesting medications
- encounter.mdx - Defines the Encounter resource for representing a healthcare encounter/visit

Each file follows a consistent structure to specify:

- Resource properties and descriptions
- Required vs optional fields  
- Data types used
- Search parameters
- Inherited properties

This standardized format makes it easy for developers to quickly find the information they need about any given resource.

## Dependencies

The resource definitions reference the base FHIR specification and use FHIR-specific concepts and data types. Implementations would typically rely on a FHIR library or framework to work with these resources.

Some key dependencies include:

- FHIR R4 specification (version 4.0.1)
- FHIR data types like CodeableConcept, Identifier, Reference, etc.
- FHIR search parameter types (e.g. token, reference, date)

## Configuration 

The resource definitions themselves don't require configuration. However, when implementing systems that use these resources, there may be configuration options for:

- Which optional fields to support
- Custom extensions to add
- Search parameter indexes to create
- Validation rules to enforce

The exact configuration would depend on the specific FHIR implementation being used.
