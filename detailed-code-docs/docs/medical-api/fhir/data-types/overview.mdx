## High-level description

This directory contains definitions for FHIR data types used in the medical API. FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. The data types defined here provide structured formats for representing various kinds of healthcare data.

## What does it do?

The data types in this directory define the structure and constraints for different kinds of data used in healthcare information exchange. They provide standardized ways to represent things like:

- Addresses and contact information
- Ages and time periods
- Annotations and notes
- Attachments and references to external content  
- Codes and coded concepts
- Dates, times, and durations
- Identifiers
- Names
- Numeric quantities and ranges
- Signatures

These data types are used as building blocks to construct more complex FHIR resources and elements. By using standardized data types, systems can more easily exchange and interpret healthcare data in a consistent way.

## Key Files

Some of the most important data type definitions include:

- address.mdx - Defines structure for postal/physical addresses
- codeableconcept.mdx - Represents coded concepts that can link to terminology systems
- identifier.mdx - Defines identifiers used to uniquely identify entities
- period.mdx - Represents time periods with start/end dates
- quantity.mdx - Represents numeric quantities with units
- reference.mdx - Defines references to other FHIR resources

Each file defines the properties, data types, and constraints for a particular FHIR data type. The definitions use a consistent structure to specify things like:

- Required vs optional fields
- Allowed data types for each field
- Cardinality (e.g. whether multiple values are allowed)
- Descriptions and usage notes

By providing these detailed specifications, the data types enable consistent implementation and interoperability between systems using the FHIR standard.

## Dependencies

The data types defined here are fundamental building blocks used throughout the FHIR specification. They don't have external dependencies themselves, but are used extensively by FHIR resources and other more complex data structures.

The definitions reference the base FHIR specification and use FHIR-specific concepts like Extensions. Implementations would typically rely on a FHIR library or framework to work with these data types.

## Configuration

The data type definitions themselves don't require configuration. However, when implementing systems that use these data types, there may be configuration options for how strictly to validate against the specifications, how to handle extensions, etc. The exact configuration would depend on the specific FHIR implementation being used.
