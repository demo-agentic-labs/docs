## High-level description

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for Metriport's Medical API, covering various aspects of healthcare data management, including API reference, FHIR resources, getting started guide, and additional information. The documentation is designed to help developers integrate and utilize Metriport's Medical API effectively in their healthcare applications.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory serves several purposes:

1. Provides a detailed API reference for various endpoints related to patient management, document handling, facility management, organization management, and FHIR data operations.

2. Offers in-depth information about FHIR resources used in the Medical API, including their properties, search parameters, and inherited properties.

3. Guides developers through the process of getting started with the Medical API, from account creation to accessing patient data and sharing information with health information exchanges.

4. Provides additional information on advanced features, sandbox environment, SDK usage, webhooks, and frequently asked questions.

This comprehensive set of documents enables developers to:

- Understand the structure and capabilities of the Medical API
- Implement various healthcare data management functionalities in their applications
- Work with standardized FHIR resources for interoperability
- Test their integrations in a sandbox environment
- Efficiently handle asynchronous operations using webhooks
- Troubleshoot common issues and find answers to frequently asked questions

## Entry points

The main entry points for developers using this documentation are:

1. Getting Started Guide (docs/medical-api/getting-started): This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up and using the Medical API, including account creation, API key generation, organization registration, and basic data operations.

2. API Reference (docs/medical-api/api-reference): This section contains detailed information about all available API endpoints, their parameters, and response structures. It's organized into categories such as Patient API, Document API, Facility API, Organization API, and FHIR API.

3. FHIR Resources (docs/medical-api/fhir): This directory provides comprehensive information about the FHIR resources used in the Medical API, including their properties, search parameters, and data types.

4. Additional Information (docs/medical-api/more-info): This section covers advanced topics, frequently asked questions, and specific features like the sandbox environment, SDK usage, and webhooks.

## Key Files

1. api-reference/: Contains detailed documentation for all API endpoints, organized by functionality (e.g., patient, document, facility, organization, FHIR).

2. fhir/: Includes files for each FHIR resource used in the API, providing detailed specifications and search parameters.

3. getting-started.mdx: A comprehensive guide to help developers start using the Medical API, covering all essential steps from account creation to data sharing.

4. more-info/: Contains additional documentation on various topics, including:
   - etag.mdx: Explains the use of ETags for preventing mid-air collisions
   - faq.mdx: Frequently asked questions about the Medical API
   - sandbox.mdx: Details on using the sandbox environment for testing
   - sdk.mdx: Information on using the Metriport SDK
   - webhooks.mdx: Explanation of the webhook system for asynchronous updates

## Dependencies

The main dependencies mentioned in the documentation are:

1. Metriport SDK (@metriport/api-sdk): Used for easy integration with the Medical API in Node.js applications.
2. FHIR R4 specification (version 4.0.1): The API follows this standard for healthcare data interoperability.
3. Node.js: Required for using the Metriport SDK.

## Configuration

Key configuration aspects mentioned in the documentation include:

1. API Key: Required for authentication when making API requests or initializing the SDK.

2. Webhook URL: Can be configured for receiving asynchronous notifications about document availability and other events.

3. Sandbox Mode: Can be enabled for testing and development purposes, allowing the use of example clinical data.

4. SDK Initialization:
   ```javascript
   import { MetriportMedicalApi } from "@metriport/api-sdk";
   const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY", { sandbox: true });
   ```

5. Organization and Facility Setup: Required for HIPAA compliance and proper data management within the API.

The documentation provides a comprehensive resource for developers to understand, implement, and utilize Metriport's Medical API effectively in their healthcare applications, covering everything from basic setup to advanced features and FHIR resource management.
