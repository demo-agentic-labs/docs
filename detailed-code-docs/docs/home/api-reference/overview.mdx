## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for the Settings API endpoints in the Metriport Medical API. It covers four main operations: retrieving settings, updating settings, getting webhook status, and retrying webhook requests. These endpoints allow users to manage their account settings, particularly focusing on webhook configurations and status.

## What does it do?
The Settings API provides functionality to:
1. Retrieve current account settings, including webhook URL and authentication key.
2. Update account settings, specifically the webhook URL.
3. Check the status of the webhook, including whether it's enabled, any error messages, and the number of requests being processed or failed.
4. Trigger a retry of failed webhook requests.

These operations are crucial for integrating Metriport's services with a user's application, especially for setting up and managing webhooks for real-time data updates.

## Key Files
1. `get-settings.mdx`: Documents the GET /settings endpoint, which retrieves the current account settings.
2. `post-settings.mdx`: Covers the POST /settings endpoint, used for updating the webhook URL in the account settings.
3. `get-webhook.mdx`: Describes the GET /settings/webhook endpoint, which provides detailed status information about the webhook.
4. `retry-webhook.mdx`: Explains the POST /settings/webhook/retry endpoint, used to retry failed webhook requests.

## Dependencies
The documentation references the Metriport SDK, specifically the `MetriportMedicalApi` class from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package. This SDK is used in the code examples to demonstrate how to interact with the API endpoints.

## Configuration
The API endpoints require an API key for authentication. This is demonstrated in the code examples where a `MetriportMedicalApi` instance is created with `"YOUR_API_KEY"`.

Key configurable fields include:
- `webhookUrl`: The URL where webhook notifications will be sent.
- `webhookKey`: An authentication key for securing webhook calls.

Here's an example of how to use the Metriport SDK to update settings:

```javascript
import { MetriportMedicalApi } from "@metriport/api-sdk";

const metriportClient = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");

const response = await metriportClient.updateSettings("https://api.health.com/webhook");
```

The response from the settings endpoints typically includes:

```json
{
  "id": "&lt;settings-id&gt;",
  "webhookUrl": "https://server.domain.com/webhook/endpoint",
  "webhookKey": "&lt;webhook-key&gt;"
}
```

The webhook status endpoint provides more detailed information:

```json
{
  "webhookEnabled": false,
  "webhookStatusDetail": "Request failed with status code 404",
  "webhookRequestsProcessing": 0,
  "webhookRequestsFailed": 3
}
```

These endpoints are crucial for managing the integration between a user's application and Metriport's services, particularly for setting up and monitoring real-time data updates via webhooks.
