## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for the Metriport platform, focusing on API information, API reference, and a welcome page. It provides comprehensive guidance for developers integrating with Metriport's Medical API and Converter API, covering topics such as API keys, error handling, webhooks, and various API endpoints.

## What does it do?
The documentation in this directory serves multiple purposes:

1. It welcomes developers to the Metriport platform and provides quick links to get started with the Medical API and Converter API.
2. It explains how to securely use and manage API keys, handle errors, and set up webhooks for real-time data updates.
3. It provides detailed information on various API endpoints, including those for managing account settings and webhook configurations.
4. It offers code examples and explanations to help developers effectively integrate Metriport's services into their applications.

## Key Files

1. welcome.mdx:
   - Serves as the landing page for the documentation.
   - Provides quick links to Medical API and Converter API quickstart guides.
   - Includes links to the GitHub repository and contact information.

2. api-info directory:
   - Contains documentation on API keys, error responses, and webhooks.
   - Explains security best practices and standardized error formats.
   - Provides comprehensive guidance on setting up and using webhooks.

3. api-reference directory:
   - Documents the Settings API endpoints for the Metriport Medical API.
   - Covers operations such as retrieving and updating settings, checking webhook status, and retrying webhook requests.

## Dependencies
The documentation references the Metriport SDK, specifically the `MetriportMedicalApi` class from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package. This SDK is used in code examples to demonstrate API interactions.

## Configuration
The documentation mentions several configuration options:

1. API Key: Required for authentication with the Metriport API.
2. Webhook URL: Set on the Developers page in the dashboard or via the Update Settings endpoint.
3. Webhook Key: Generated automatically when setting up the webhook URL, used for authenticating webhook requests.

Key concepts covered in the documentation include:

1. API Key Security:
   - API keys provide full access to the Metriport API and should be treated with high security.
   - Keys should only be used in backend services and never exposed in plain text.

2. Error Handling:
   - Error responses follow the RFC 7807 format, including fields such as status, name, title, and detail.

3. Webhooks:
   - Allow Metriport to push data to the client application in real-time.
   - Require setting up a public endpoint and configuring it in the Metriport dashboard.
   - Messages are authenticated using HMAC SHA-256 signatures.
   - Include retry mechanisms for failed deliveries.

4. Settings API Endpoints:
   - GET /settings: Retrieves current account settings.
   - POST /settings: Updates the webhook URL.
   - GET /settings/webhook: Provides detailed webhook status information.
   - POST /settings/webhook/retry: Triggers a retry of failed webhook requests.

Example of using the Metriport SDK to update settings:

```javascript
import { MetriportMedicalApi } from "@metriport/api-sdk";

const metriportClient = new MetriportMedicalApi("YOUR_API_KEY");

const response = await metriportClient.updateSettings("https://api.health.com/webhook");
```

This documentation provides developers with a comprehensive guide to integrating Metriport's services, covering everything from initial setup to advanced webhook management and error handling.
