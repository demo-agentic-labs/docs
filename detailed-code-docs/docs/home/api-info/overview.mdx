## High-level description
This directory contains documentation related to API information for the Metriport platform. It covers essential topics such as API keys, error responses, and webhooks, providing developers with crucial information for integrating and using the Metriport API effectively.

## What does it do?
The documentation in this directory serves to educate developers on key aspects of working with the Metriport API:

1. It explains how to securely use and manage API keys for authentication.
2. It describes the standardized error response format used by the API, helping developers understand and handle errors effectively.
3. It provides detailed information on setting up and using webhooks to receive real-time data updates from Metriport.

These resources help developers implement secure, efficient, and reliable integrations with the Metriport platform.

## Key Files

1. api-keys.mdx:
   - Explains the importance of API key security.
   - Provides guidelines for generating and managing API keys.
   - Warns about potential security risks and best practices.

2. error-responses.mdx:
   - Describes the standardized error response format used by the Metriport API.
   - Explains each field in the error response and its significance.
   - Helps developers understand and handle API errors effectively.

3. webhooks.mdx:
   - Provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and using webhooks with Metriport.
   - Covers webhook authentication, message formats, and handling different types of webhook events.
   - Explains retry mechanisms for failed webhook deliveries.

## Configuration
The documentation mentions configuration options related to webhooks:

1. Webhook URL: Set on the Developers page in the developer dashboard or via the Update Settings endpoint.
2. Webhook Key: Generated automatically when setting up the webhook URL, used for authenticating webhook requests.

## Dependencies
The documentation doesn't explicitly mention any external dependencies. However, it does reference the use of cryptography libraries for webhook signature validation, which would be a dependency in the implementation.

Here's a summary of the key concepts covered in each file:

1. api-keys.mdx:
   - API keys provide full access to the Metriport API.
   - Keys should be treated with high security, similar to account passwords.
   - Keys should only be used in backend services and never exposed in plain text.
   - Compromised keys can be revoked and new ones generated.

2. error-responses.mdx:
   - Error responses follow the RFC 7807 format.
   - The standard error response includes fields such as status, name, title, and detail.
   - This standardized format helps developers quickly understand and handle API errors.

3. webhooks.mdx:
   - Webhooks allow Metriport to push data to the client application in real-time.
   - Setting up webhooks involves exposing a public endpoint and configuring it in the Metriport dashboard.
   - Webhook messages are authenticated using HMAC SHA-256 signatures.
   - Different types of webhook messages include ping messages and Medical API messages.
   - The documentation provides code examples for validating webhook signatures in Node.js and Python.
   - Retry mechanisms are available for failed webhook deliveries, both through the dashboard and API.

This documentation provides developers with a comprehensive understanding of how to securely authenticate, handle errors, and receive real-time updates when working with the Metriport API.
