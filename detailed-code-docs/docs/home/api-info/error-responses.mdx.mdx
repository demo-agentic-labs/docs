## Overview

In the event that there's an issue when making a request to our API, we'll return a
standardized error response that describes the nature of the error in detail.

Read more below to get familiar with the error response format.

&lt;Tip&gt;
  Our error responses are based on the [RFC 7807 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807) - a
  widely used standard for HTTP APIs.
&lt;/Tip&gt;

## Format

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "name": "NOT_FOUND",
  "title": "NotFoundError",
  "detail": "Could not find organization Devault Medical"
}
```

&lt;ResponseField name="status" type="number" required&gt;
  Numeric HTTP status code.
&lt;/ResponseField&gt;

&lt;ResponseField name="name" type="string" required&gt;
  Human-readable description of the status code.
&lt;/ResponseField&gt;

&lt;ResponseField name="title" type="string" required&gt;
  The specific error description - this wont't change between occurences of the same error.
&lt;/ResponseField&gt;

&lt;ResponseField name="detail" type="string" required&gt;
  Details about this error occurrence - this might change between occurences.
&lt;/ResponseField&gt;
