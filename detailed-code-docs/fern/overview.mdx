## High-level description
This directory contains the API definition and configuration files for a comprehensive medical data management system using the Fern framework. It defines various endpoints, data structures, and configurations for handling medical information, including patient records, documents, facilities, organizations, and FHIR resources. The directory also includes configuration files for generating SDKs in multiple programming languages and specifies external dependencies.

## What does it do?
The API defined in this directory enables developers to:

1. Manage patient records: Create, retrieve, update, list, and delete patient information, including medical record summaries and patient matching.
2. Handle medical documents: Query, list, download, and upload medical documents for patients across different healthcare information exchanges (HIEs).
3. Manage medical facilities: Create, retrieve, update, list, and delete information about medical facilities.
4. Work with FHIR resources: Query, create, and count patient data using standardized FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) formats.
5. Manage organizations: Create, retrieve, and update organization information within the medical system.
6. Receive real-time updates: Define and handle webhooks for various events related to medical data, such as document updates and consolidated patient information.

Additionally, the configuration files in this directory allow for:

7. Generating SDKs: Automatically create client libraries for Python, Java, and Node.js to interact with the API.
8. Managing dependencies: Specify and version external dependencies, particularly the FHIR Fern Definition.
9. Configuring the Fern framework: Set organization name, version, and other Fern-specific settings.

## Key Files
1. definition/api.yml: Defines the overall API configuration, including authentication method (ApiKey), environment (Production), and error handling strategy.

2. definition/commons.yml: Specifies common data types used across the API, such as Address and USState, providing standardized structures for location-based information.

3. definition/medical/document.yml: Outlines the API for medical document management, allowing operations like querying, listing, downloading, and uploading patient documents.

4. definition/medical/facility.yml: Defines endpoints for managing medical facilities, including creation, retrieval, updating, listing, and deletion.

5. definition/medical/fhir.yml: Specifies FHIR-based endpoints for patient data management, enabling standardized healthcare data exchange.

6. definition/medical/organization.yml: Provides API definitions for organization management within the medical system.

7. definition/medical/patient.yml: Defines comprehensive patient record management endpoints, including creation, retrieval, updating, listing, and deletion of patient information.

8. definition/medical/webhooks.yml: Specifies the structure of webhook payloads for various medical data events, enabling real-time notifications and integrations.

9. dependencies.yml: Specifies external dependencies, particularly the FHIR Fern Definition.

10. fern.config.json: Contains configuration settings for the Fern framework, including organization name and version.

11. generators.yml: Defines configurations for generating SDKs in Python, Java, and Node.js, including output locations and various options.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used across these files is the FHIR package, which provides standardized healthcare data structures and definitions. This is referenced in the fhir.yml file and is crucial for ensuring interoperability in healthcare data exchange.

The API also relies on internal dependencies:
1. A commons package (defined in commons.yml) that provides shared types like Address and USState.
2. The @fern/fhir package, version 0.0.0-4, which is likely a Fern-specific wrapper or implementation of FHIR standards.

## Configuration
The API is configured with the following key settings:

1. Authentication: Uses an ApiKey scheme, with the key expected in the X-API-Key header.
2. Base URL: https://api.metriport.com (Production environment)
3. Error Handling: Utilizes HTTP status codes for error discrimination.
4. Base Path: All endpoints use the /medical/v1/ prefix, followed by the specific resource (e.g., /medical/v1/document, /medical/v1/facility).

The Fern framework is configured with:
1. Organization: "metriport"
2. Version: "0.26.8"

SDK generation is configured for Python, Java, and Node.js, with specific output locations, package names, and options for each language.

This comprehensive API definition and configuration provide a robust foundation for building medical data management systems, ensuring standardization, security, and interoperability in healthcare information exchange, while also facilitating easy integration through automatically generated SDKs.
