## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files that define the API specification for a medical data management system. It covers various aspects of medical data handling, including patient records, medical documents, facilities, organizations, FHIR resources, and webhooks.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines a comprehensive API for managing medical data. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Document Management: Allows querying, listing, downloading, and uploading medical documents for patients across different healthcare information exchanges (HIEs).

2. Facility Management: Provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, listing, and deleting medical facilities.

3. FHIR Resource Handling: Offers endpoints for querying, creating, and counting patient data using FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards.

4. Organization Management: Enables the creation, retrieval, and updating of organization information in the medical system.

5. Patient Management: Provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, listing, and deleting patient records, as well as managing medical record summaries and patient matching.

6. Webhook Definitions: Specifies the structure of webhook payloads for various events related to medical data, such as document updates and consolidated patient data.

## Key Files
1. `document.yml`: Defines the API for medical document management.
2. `facility.yml`: Specifies the API for managing medical facilities.
3. `fhir.yml`: Outlines the FHIR-based API for patient data management.
4. `organization.yml`: Defines the API for organization management.
5. `patient.yml`: Specifies the API for patient record management.
6. `webhooks.yml`: Defines the structure of webhook payloads for various medical data events.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used across these files is the FHIR package, which provides standardized healthcare data structures and definitions. The files also reference a `commons` package, likely containing shared types and utilities.

## Configuration
The API specifications use a base path structure of `/medical/v1/` followed by the specific resource (e.g., `/medical/v1/document`, `/medical/v1/facility`). All endpoints require authentication.

This directory provides a comprehensive API specification for a medical data management system, covering various aspects of healthcare data handling and integration. It uses standardized formats like FHIR and provides detailed type definitions to ensure consistency and interoperability in medical data exchange.
