## High-level description
This YAML file defines the API specification for managing organizations in a medical system. It outlines the structure and endpoints for creating, retrieving, and updating organization information, including details like name, type, and location.

## Code Structure
The file is structured into two main sections: `service` and `types`. The `service` section defines the API endpoints, while the `types` section specifies the data structures used in requests and responses.

## Symbols

## Notes
1. The file uses a schema for YAML validation, as indicated by the comment at the top.
2. The API requires authentication for all endpoints.
3. The `update` endpoint includes an optional `ETag` header, which is likely used for concurrency control.
4. The `Organization` type extends `OrganizationCreate`, adding an `id` field.
5. The `OrgType` enum in this file corresponds to the `TreatmentType` enum in the related `organization.ts` file, which suggests that `OrgType` might be deprecated in favor of `TreatmentType` in the future.
