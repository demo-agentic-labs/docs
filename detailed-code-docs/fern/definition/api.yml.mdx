title: "api.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines the configuration for an API named "api". It specifies the authentication method, environments, and error handling strategy for the API. This configuration is likely used by a framework or tool to generate API documentation, client libraries, or server-side code.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Specifies the name of the API as "api".

### `auth`
#### Description
Defines the authentication method for the API as "ApiKey".

### `auth-schemes`
#### Description
Provides details about the authentication scheme used by the API.

#### Internal Logic
The `ApiKey` scheme is defined with the following properties:
- `header`: Specifies that the API key should be sent in the "X-API-Key" header.
- `name`: Sets the name of the API key parameter as "apiKey".

### `environments`
#### Description
Defines the available environments for the API.

#### Internal Logic
Only one environment is defined:
- `Production`: Set to the URL "https://api.metriport.com"

### `default-environment`
#### Description
Specifies the default environment as "Production".

### `error-discrimination`
#### Description
Defines how errors are distinguished in the API responses.

#### Internal Logic
The `strategy` is set to "status-code", indicating that HTTP status codes are used to differentiate between different types of errors.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | api | The name of the API |
| auth | string | ApiKey | The authentication method used |
| default-environment | string | Production | The default environment for the API |

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't directly expose an API, it defines how the API should be accessed:

| Aspect | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| Authentication | ApiKey | API key should be sent in the X-API-Key header |
| Base URL | https://api.metriport.com | The production environment URL |
| Error Handling | status-code | Errors are distinguished by HTTP status codes |

This configuration suggests that any client interacting with this API should:
1. Include an API key in the X-API-Key header for authentication.
2. Use https://api.metriport.com as the base URL for API requests.
3. Expect errors to be indicated by HTTP status codes.
