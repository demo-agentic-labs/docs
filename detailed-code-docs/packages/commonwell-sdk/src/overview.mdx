## High-level description
The `packages/commonwell-sdk/src` directory contains the core implementation of the CommonWell SDK, which is designed to interact with the CommonWell Health Alliance API. This SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing healthcare data, including patient information, documents, organizations, and network links within the CommonWell ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The CommonWell SDK facilitates various healthcare interoperability operations:

1. Organization management: Creating, updating, and retrieving organization data.
2. Patient and person enrollment: Registering and managing patient and person records.
3. Document handling: Querying, retrieving, and managing patient documents.
4. Network link management: Handling patient links across different healthcare providers.
5. API authentication: Generating JWTs for secure API interactions.
6. Error handling: Providing custom error classes for CommonWell and Metriport-specific issues.
7. Data validation: Ensuring data integrity through schema validation.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers using this SDK is the `CommonWell` class defined in `client/commonwell.ts`. This class implements the `CommonWellAPI` interface, providing concrete implementations for all supported API operations.

The SDK's functionality is exposed through `index.ts`, which exports various components, models, and utility functions for easy access.

## Key Files
1. `client/commonwell.ts`: Implements the `CommonWell` class, the primary client for API interactions.
2. `common/make-jwt.ts`: Provides JWT creation functionality for API authentication.
3. `common/util.ts`: Contains utility functions for various SDK operations.
4. `models/`: Directory containing data model definitions and schemas.
5. `index.ts`: Main export file for the SDK.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on several external libraries:
- axios: For making HTTP requests
- jsonwebtoken: For JWT creation
- zod: For schema validation
- @faker-js/faker: For generating mock data in tests
- http-status: For handling HTTP status codes

## Configuration
The SDK can be configured through the `CommonWell` class constructor, which accepts parameters such as:
- Organization certificate and RSA private key
- Organization name and OID
- API mode (integration or production)
- Optional parameters like request timeout

Example initialization:

```typescript
const client = new CommonWell(
  orgCert,
  rsaPrivateKey,
  orgName,
  oid,
  APIMode.Integration,
  { timeout: 180000 }
);
```

The SDK provides a robust set of tools for interacting with the CommonWell Health Alliance API, abstracting complex operations and providing a developer-friendly interface for healthcare data management and interoperability tasks.
