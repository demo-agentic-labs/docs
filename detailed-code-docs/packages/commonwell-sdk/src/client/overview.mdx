## High-level description
This directory contains the client implementation for interacting with the CommonWell Health Alliance API. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and classes to manage organizations, persons, patients, documents, and links within the CommonWell network. The code is structured to handle various API operations, including data retrieval, creation, and updates.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to:
1. Create and manage organizations within the CommonWell network
2. Enroll and manage persons and patients
3. Query and retrieve patient documents
4. Handle network links and certificates
5. Perform various other operations related to healthcare data management

It abstracts the complexities of direct API interactions, providing a more user-friendly interface for developers to work with the CommonWell Health Alliance system.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers using this SDK is the `CommonWell` class defined in `commonwell.ts`. This class implements the `CommonWellAPI` interface (defined in `commonwell-api.ts`), providing concrete implementations for all the API operations.

The workflow typically involves:
1. Initializing a `CommonWell` instance with necessary credentials and configuration
2. Using the instance methods to perform various operations (e.g., enrolling a person, querying documents)
3. Handling the responses and errors returned by these methods

For document-specific operations, the `document.ts` file provides additional utility functions that can be used directly or are internally used by the `CommonWell` class.

## Key Files
1. `commonwell-api.ts`: Defines the `CommonWellAPI` interface, which serves as a contract for the CommonWell client implementation.

2. `commonwell.ts`: Implements the `CommonWell` class, which is the main client for interacting with the CommonWell API. It provides methods for all supported API operations.

3. `document.ts`: Contains utility functions for document-related operations, including querying and retrieving patient documents.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries:
- axios: For making HTTP requests to the CommonWell API
- http-status: For handling HTTP status codes
- stream: For handling document retrieval streams

Internal dependencies include various utility functions and models from other parts of the SDK.

## Configuration
The `CommonWell` class constructor accepts several configuration parameters:
- `orgCert`: The certificate (public key) for the organization
- `rsaPrivateKey`: An RSA key corresponding to the specified orgCert
- `orgName`: The name of the organization
- `oid`: The organization's OID
- `apiMode`: The mode the client will be running (integration or production)
- `options`: Optional parameters including timeout (default 120 seconds)

These parameters are used to initialize the API client and set up the necessary authentication and request configurations.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how to initialize and use the `CommonWell` client:

```typescript
const client = new CommonWell(
  orgCert,
  rsaPrivateKey,
  orgName,
  oid,
  APIMode.Integration,
  { timeout: 180000 }
);

// Enrolling a person
const enrolledPerson = await client.enrollPerson(requestMetadata, personData);

// Querying documents for a patient
const documentQueryResponse = await client.queryDocuments(requestMetadata, patientId);
```

For document retrieval:

```typescript
const outputStream = fs.createWriteStream('document.pdf');
await client.retrieveDocument(requestMetadata, documentUrl, outputStream);
```

The `CommonWell` class handles error scenarios by throwing `MetriportError` instances, which developers should catch and handle appropriately:

```typescript
try {
  const patient = await client.registerPatient(requestMetadata, patientData);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof MetriportError) {
    console.error('CommonWell API error:', error.message);
  } else {
    console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
  }
}
```

The document utility functions in `document.ts` can be used directly if needed:

```typescript
import { query, retrieve } from './document';

const documentQueryResponse = await query(axiosInstance, headers, patientId);
await retrieve(axiosInstance, headers, documentUrl, outputStream);
```

These functions provide more granular control over document operations and can be useful in specific scenarios where the full `CommonWell` client is not needed.

In summary, this directory provides a robust and flexible client implementation for interacting with the CommonWell Health Alliance API, enabling developers to easily integrate CommonWell functionality into their healthcare applications.
