## High-level description
This directory contains model definitions for the CommonWell SDK, which is used to interact with the CommonWell Health Alliance API. It defines various data structures, schemas, and utility functions for handling healthcare-related data such as patients, organizations, documents, and identifiers.

## What does it do?
The models in this directory provide a structured way to represent and validate data used in healthcare interoperability scenarios. They define the shape of data objects, enforce data integrity through validation schemas, and provide utility functions for working with these data structures. This ensures that data exchanged with the CommonWell Health Alliance API is consistent and properly formatted.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is likely the `index.ts` file (not provided in the summaries), which would export the various models and types for use in other parts of the SDK. Key models include:

1. `patient.ts`: Defines the structure of patient data and related responses.
2. `document.ts`: Handles document-related data structures and queries.
3. `organization.ts`: Manages organization information and interactions with the API.
4. `person.ts`: Defines person-related data structures and utility functions.

## Key Files

1. `patient.ts`: Defines the `patientSchema` and related types for patient data.
2. `document.ts`: Contains schemas for document references and content.
3. `demographics.ts`: Defines the structure for demographic information.
4. `identifier.ts`: Handles various types of identifiers used in the system.
5. `link.ts`: Manages patient and network link structures.
6. `organization.ts`: Provides functions for creating, updating, and retrieving organization data.
7. `person.ts`: Defines person-related schemas and utility functions.

## Dependencies
The models heavily rely on the following external libraries:

1. Zod: Used for schema definition, validation, and type inference.
2. @faker-js/faker: Used in test utilities for generating mock data.

## Configuration
Many of the models reference the CommonWell Alliance specification for their structure. For example:

- `address.ts` references: https://specification.commonwellalliance.org/services/rest-api-reference (8.4.3 Address)
- `period.ts` references: https://specification.commonwellalliance.org/services/rest-api-reference (8.4.12 Period)

These specifications guide the structure and validation rules of the data models.

The models in this directory form the backbone of data handling in the CommonWell SDK, ensuring that all interactions with the CommonWell Health Alliance API use consistent, well-defined, and validated data structures. This promotes reliability and interoperability in healthcare data exchange scenarios.
