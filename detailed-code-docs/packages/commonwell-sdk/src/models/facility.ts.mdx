## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for a facility object in the CommonWell SDK. It includes fields for the facility's ID, name, and address, utilizing the Zod library for runtime type checking and validation.

## Code Structure
The code imports the `z` object from the Zod library and the `addressSchema` from a local `address` module. It then defines and exports a `facilitySchema` using Zod's object schema.

## References
- `addressSchema` from "./address"

## Symbols

### `facilitySchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure and validation rules for a facility object using Zod.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a schema definition, not a function)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| facilitySchema | z.ZodObject | A Zod schema for validating facility objects |

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines three fields:
1. `id`: An optional and nullable string
2. `name`: An optional and nullable string
3. `address`: An optional and nullable object conforming to the `addressSchema`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for creating and defining the schema |

## Related Information
The `facilitySchema` is used in the `patientSchema` defined in the `patient.ts` file. It's included as an optional array field named `facilities` within the patient object. This suggests that a patient can be associated with multiple facilities in the CommonWell system.

The `addressSchema` imported and used in this file is defined in the `address.ts` file. It includes fields such as `use`, `line`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`, and `period`. This provides a standardized structure for representing addresses across the SDK.

By using Zod for schema definition, the SDK ensures type safety and runtime validation for facility objects, which can help prevent errors and improve data consistency when working with facility information in the CommonWell ecosystem.
