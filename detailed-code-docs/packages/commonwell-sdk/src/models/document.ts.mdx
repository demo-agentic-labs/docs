title: "document.ts"
---

Here's a high-level description of the target file (packages/commonwell-sdk/src/models/document.ts):

This file defines TypeScript types and Zod schemas for document-related data structures used in the CommonWell SDK. It includes definitions for DocumentReference, DocumentContent, and related types. The file uses Zod for runtime type checking and validation of these structures.

## Code Structure

The file defines several interconnected types and schemas:

1. `resourceTypeSchema`: Defines the possible resource types.
2. `identifierSchema`: Defines the structure of an identifier.
3. `codeableConceptSchema`: Defines the structure of a codeable concept.
4. `containedSchema`: Defines the structure of contained resources.
5. `statusSchema`: Defines the possible document statuses.
6. `eventSchema`: Defines the structure of clinical events.
7. `contentSchema`: Defines the main structure of a document's content.
8. `documentSchema`: Combines the document ID and content.
9. `operationOutcomeSchema`: Defines the structure of operation outcomes.
10. `documentQueryResponseSchema` and `documentQueryFullResponseSchema`: Define the structure of document query responses.

These schemas and types are interrelated, with many referencing each other to create a comprehensive structure for representing document-related data in the CommonWell SDK.

## Symbols

### `resourceTypeSchema`
#### Description
Defines the possible resource types as a string (optional).

### `identifierSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure of an identifier, including use, system, and value.

### `codeableConceptSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a codeable concept, including coding and text.

### `containedSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure of contained resources, including various optional fields like identifier, name, and address.

### `statusSchema`
#### Description
Defines the possible document statuses as an enum.

### `eventSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure of clinical events, based on the codeableConceptSchema.

### `contentSchema`
#### Description
Defines the main structure of a document's content, including various fields like resourceType, contained, masterIdentifier, subject, type, author, and context.

### `documentSchema`
#### Description
Combines the document ID and content into a single schema.

### `operationOutcomeSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure of operation outcomes, including id and content.

### `documentQueryResponseSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure of document query responses, filtering for DocumentReference resources.

### `documentQueryFullResponseSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure of full document query responses, including both DocumentReference and OperationOutcome resources.

## Dependencies
The file imports from the following modules:
- `zod`: For schema definition and validation
- `./address`: For address-related schemas
- `./demographics`: For gender-related schemas
- `./human-name`: For human name schemas
- `./identifier`: For identifier-related schemas
- `./iso-datetime`: For date/time schemas
- `./period`: For period schemas

This file is crucial for defining the structure and validation of document-related data in the CommonWell SDK, ensuring type safety and consistency in the handling of document information.
