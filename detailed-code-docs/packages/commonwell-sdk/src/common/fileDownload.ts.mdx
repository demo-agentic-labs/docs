## High-level description
This code defines a function `downloadFile` that downloads a file from a given URL and writes it to a provided output stream. It uses Axios for making HTTP requests and Node.js streams for efficient file handling.

## Symbols

### `downloadFile`
#### Description
This asynchronous function downloads a file from a specified URL and writes it to a provided output stream. It supports optional custom headers and allows the use of a custom Axios instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL of the file to be downloaded |
| outputStream | stream.Writable | The writable stream to which the downloaded file will be written |
| client | AxiosInstance (optional) | A custom Axios instance for making the HTTP request |
| headers | object (optional) | Custom headers to be included in the HTTP request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;boolean&gt; | A promise that resolves to `true` when the download is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an Axios request configuration object with `responseType` set to "stream" and includes custom headers if provided.
2. Makes a GET request to the specified URL using either the provided Axios client or the default Axios instance.
3. Uses `util.promisify` and `stream.pipeline` to pipe the response data to the provided output stream.
4. Returns `true` when the download is complete.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| axios | Making HTTP requests to download the file |
| stream | Handling streaming of the downloaded file |
| util | Promisifying the stream pipeline for async/await usage |

## Error Handling
The function doesn't implement explicit error handling. Errors that occur during the download process will be propagated to the caller, who should handle them appropriately.

## Performance Considerations
The use of streams for downloading and writing the file allows for efficient memory usage, especially for large files, as it doesn't need to load the entire file into memory before writing it to the output stream.
