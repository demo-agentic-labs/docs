## High-level description
The `packages/commonwell-sdk` directory contains the implementation of the CommonWell SDK, a package designed to simplify integration with the CommonWell Health Alliance API. This SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing healthcare data, including patient information, documents, organizations, and network links within the CommonWell ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The CommonWell SDK facilitates various healthcare interoperability operations:

1. Organization management: Creating, updating, and retrieving organization data.
2. Patient and person enrollment: Registering and managing patient and person records.
3. Document handling: Querying, retrieving, and managing patient documents.
4. Network link management: Handling patient links across different healthcare providers.
5. API authentication: Generating JWTs for secure API interactions.
6. Error handling: Providing custom error classes for CommonWell and Metriport-specific issues.
7. Data validation: Ensuring data integrity through schema validation.

The SDK abstracts complex operations and provides a developer-friendly interface for healthcare data management and interoperability tasks.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers using this SDK is the `CommonWell` class defined in `src/client/commonwell.ts`. This class implements the `CommonWellAPI` interface, providing concrete implementations for all supported API operations.

The SDK's functionality is exposed through `src/index.ts`, which exports various components, models, and utility functions for easy access.

## Key Files
1. `src/client/commonwell.ts`: Implements the `CommonWell` class, the primary client for API interactions.
2. `src/common/make-jwt.ts`: Provides JWT creation functionality for API authentication.
3. `src/common/util.ts`: Contains utility functions for various SDK operations.
4. `src/models/`: Directory containing data model definitions and schemas.
5. `src/index.ts`: Main export file for the SDK.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on several external libraries:
- axios: For making HTTP requests
- jsonwebtoken: For JWT creation
- zod: For schema validation
- @faker-js/faker: For generating mock data in tests
- http-status: For handling HTTP status codes

## Configuration
The SDK can be configured through the `CommonWell` class constructor, which accepts parameters such as:
- Organization certificate and RSA private key
- Organization name and OID
- API mode (integration or production)
- Optional parameters like request timeout

Example initialization:

```typescript
const client = new CommonWell(
  orgCert,
  rsaPrivateKey,
  orgName,
  oid,
  APIMode.Integration,
  { timeout: 180000 }
);
```

The package is set up with TypeScript, including strict type-checking and modern ECMAScript features. It uses ESLint for code linting and Jest for testing. The `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.ref.json` files provide detailed TypeScript configuration, enabling features like project references for better integration in a monorepo structure.

The `package.json` file defines the package metadata, scripts for building and testing, and dependencies. It also configures the package exports, allowing users to import specific parts of the SDK as needed.

Overall, the CommonWell SDK provides a robust and well-structured solution for integrating with the CommonWell Health Alliance API, with a focus on type safety, code quality, and developer experience.
