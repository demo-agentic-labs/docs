title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.ref.json`) extends the base configuration and sets up specific compiler options for the CommonWell SDK package. It's designed to be used as a reference in a larger project structure, enabling TypeScript's project references feature.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `include`, and `compilerOptions`. These properties work together to define the TypeScript compilation settings for the CommonWell SDK package.

## Symbols

### Root Configuration Object
#### Description
The root object in this JSON file configures TypeScript compilation for the CommonWell SDK package.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration.
2. Specifies files to include in compilation.
3. Sets compiler options specific to this package.

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that this configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends `./tsconfig.json`, which likely contains common settings shared across multiple packages in the project.

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | array of strings | Glob patterns for files to include |

#### Internal Logic
Includes all files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories using the glob pattern `"src/**/*"`.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This property sets specific compiler options for the TypeScript compiler when processing this package.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| composite | boolean | Enables TypeScript's project references feature |

#### Internal Logic
Sets `composite` to `true`, which enables TypeScript's project references feature. This allows this package to be referenced by other parts of the project and enables incremental builds.

## References
This configuration file is referenced in the root `tsconfig.json` file of the project, as seen in the related code snippet:

```json
{
  "references": [
    // ...other references...
    {
      "path": "./packages/commonwell-sdk/tsconfig.ref.json"
    },
    // ...other references...
  ]
}
```

This reference allows the main project to include the CommonWell SDK package in its build process while maintaining separate compilation settings.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the base `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory, which it extends.
