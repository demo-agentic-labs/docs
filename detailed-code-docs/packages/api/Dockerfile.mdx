title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines the production-ready container image for the Metriport API. It creates a minimal, secure environment based on Node.js 18 Alpine, optimized for running the API in a production setting without any development dependencies.

## Symbols

### Base Image
#### Description
The Dockerfile uses the official Node.js 18 Alpine image from Amazon ECR Public Gallery as its base.

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 public.ecr.aws/docker/library/node:18-alpine
```

This line specifies the base image for the container. It uses the Node.js 18 Alpine version, which is a lightweight Linux distribution. The `--platform=linux/amd64` flag ensures the image is built for the AMD64 architecture.

### Environment Configuration
#### Description
Sets the Node.js environment to production.

```dockerfile
ENV NODE_ENV production
```

This environment variable helps optimize Node.js for production use, disabling development-specific features.

### Working Directory
#### Description
Sets the working directory inside the container.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
```

This line establishes `/usr/src/app` as the working directory for subsequent commands and the application runtime.

### Application Code
#### Description
Adds the pre-built application code to the container.

```dockerfile
ADD ./metriport-api.tar.gz ./
```

This command extracts the contents of `metriport-api.tar.gz` into the working directory. This archive is expected to contain the pre-built application code.

### Dependencies Installation
#### Description
Installs production dependencies for the application.

```dockerfile
RUN npm ci --ignore-scripts --omit=dev --no-fund
```

This command installs only the production dependencies, skipping development dependencies and scripts for a leaner, more secure container.

### Port Exposure
#### Description
Exposes port 8080 for the application.

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080
```

This line indicates that the container will listen on port 8080 at runtime.

### Entrypoint
#### Description
Specifies the command to run when the container starts.

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT [ "node", "packages/api/dist/app.js" ]
```

This sets the entry point of the container to run the main application file using Node.js.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Node.js 18 | Runtime environment for the application |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Alpine Linux as the base image and the exclusion of development dependencies contribute to a smaller, more efficient container image, which can lead to faster deployments and reduced resource usage.

## TODOs
- Remove the `--platform=linux/amd64` flag when building on Intel systems, as noted in the comment.
