## High-level description

This file, `tsconfig.build.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically used for building the API package. It extends the base TypeScript configuration defined in the `tsconfig.json` file located in the same directory.

## Code Structure

The file contains a single JSON object with one property:

### `extends`

#### Description
The `extends` property is used to specify another TypeScript configuration file that this configuration should inherit from. In this case, it's set to `"./tsconfig"`, which refers to the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | The path to the base TypeScript configuration file |

## Dependencies

This configuration file depends on the existence of a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory.

## Configuration

By extending the base `tsconfig.json`, this build-specific configuration inherits all the settings from the base configuration. This approach allows for:

1. Maintaining a common set of TypeScript compiler options across different build scenarios.
2. Overriding or adding specific options for the build process if needed (although no overrides are present in this file).

This setup is commonly used to separate build-specific TypeScript configurations from the main development configuration, allowing for different settings to be applied during the build process if necessary.
