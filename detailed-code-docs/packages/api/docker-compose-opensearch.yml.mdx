title: "docker-compose-opensearch.yml"
---

## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a multi-node OpenSearch cluster with two OpenSearch nodes and an OpenSearch Dashboards instance. It sets up the necessary configurations for a basic OpenSearch deployment, including networking, volumes, and environment variables.

## Code Structure
The Docker Compose file defines three services: `opensearch-node1`, `opensearch-node2`, and `opensearch-dashboards`. It also specifies volumes for data persistence and a custom network for inter-service communication.

## Symbols

### `opensearch-node1`
#### Description
This service defines the first node of the OpenSearch cluster.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| image | string | The Docker image to use for the OpenSearch node |
| environment | list | Environment variables for configuring the OpenSearch node |
| ulimits | object | System resource limits for the container |
| volumes | list | Volume mappings for data persistence |
| ports | list | Port mappings for external access |
| networks | list | Networks the container should join |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up cluster and node configuration
- Configures memory settings and disables swapping
- Exposes ports for OpenSearch API and Performance Analyzer

### `opensearch-node2`
#### Description
This service defines the second node of the OpenSearch cluster, similar to `opensearch-node1` but without exposed ports.

#### Inputs
(Similar to `opensearch-node1`, excluding the `ports` section)

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up cluster and node configuration
- Configures memory settings and disables swapping

### `opensearch-dashboards`
#### Description
This service sets up OpenSearch Dashboards, a user interface for visualizing data from OpenSearch.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| image | string | The Docker image to use for OpenSearch Dashboards |
| ports | list | Port mappings for external access |
| expose | list | Ports to expose to other containers |
| environment | object | Environment variables for configuring OpenSearch Dashboards |
| networks | list | Networks the container should join |

#### Internal Logic
- Exposes port 5601 for web access
- Configures connection to OpenSearch nodes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| opensearchproject/opensearch:latest | OpenSearch engine |
| opensearchproject/opensearch-dashboards:latest | OpenSearch Dashboards UI |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| cluster.name | string | opensearch-cluster | Name of the OpenSearch cluster |
| node.name | string | opensearch-node1/2 | Name of each OpenSearch node |
| discovery.seed_hosts | string | opensearch-node1,opensearch-node2 | Hosts to use for cluster discovery |
| cluster.initial_cluster_manager_nodes | string | opensearch-node1,opensearch-node2 | Initial manager nodes for the cluster |
| bootstrap.memory_lock | boolean | true | Disables swapping for better performance |
| OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS | string | -Xms512m -Xmx512m | Java heap size settings |

## Performance Considerations
- Memory locking is enabled to prevent swapping and improve performance.
- Java heap size is set to 512MB minimum and maximum, which should be adjusted based on available system resources.
- The `nofile` ulimit is set to 65536 to allow for a high number of open files, which is important for OpenSearch performance.
