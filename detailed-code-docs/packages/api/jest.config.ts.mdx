title: "jest.config.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file configures Jest for testing a TypeScript project, specifically for an API package. It sets up the testing environment, specifies test file patterns, and configures TypeScript compilation for tests, with support for both unit and end-to-end (E2E) testing.

## Symbols

### `config`
#### Description
This constant defines the Jest configuration object of type `JestConfigWithTsJest`. It specifies various settings for running tests in the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This is a configuration object, not a function |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | JestConfigWithTsJest | Jest configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the preset to "ts-jest" for TypeScript support.
2. Configures the test environment as "node".
3. Enables verbose output.
4. Ignores tests in "/node_modules/" and "/dist/" directories.
5. Defines test file patterns based on whether it's an E2E test or not.
6. Specifies global teardown and setup files.
7. Configures TypeScript transformation using ts-jest with a custom tsconfig path.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| path | Used for resolving file paths |
| ts-jest | TypeScript preprocessor for Jest |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| isE2E | boolean | process.env.E2E === "true" | Determines if E2E tests should be run |
| process.env.ENV_TYPE | string | "dev" | Sets the environment type |
| tsconfig | string | Resolved path to tsconfig.dev.json | Path to TypeScript configuration file |

## Side Effects
- Sets `process.env.ENV_TYPE` to "dev".
- Resolves the path to the TypeScript configuration file based on the current working directory.

## Performance Considerations
The configuration uses `ts-jest` for TypeScript compilation, which may impact test execution speed compared to plain JavaScript tests. However, it provides the benefit of type checking during testing.

## Notes
- The configuration supports both unit tests and E2E tests, determined by the `isE2E` variable.
- The `tsconfig` path is dynamically resolved, accommodating different project structures (whether run from the root or within the "packages/api" directory).
- Global teardown and setup files are specified, which will run for all tests.
- The configuration is exported as the default export, making it easily importable by Jest.
