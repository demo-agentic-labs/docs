## High-level description
This code defines a custom error class `NotFoundError` that extends `MetriportError`. It is used to represent situations where a requested resource could not be found. The class is marked as deprecated, suggesting that it should be replaced with a version from `@metriport/core`.

## Code Structure
The `NotFoundError` class extends `MetriportError` and sets a specific HTTP status code for "Not Found" errors.
