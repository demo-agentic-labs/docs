## High-level description
This file contains a utility function `sanitize` that processes a given string by converting it to lowercase and removing leading and trailing whitespace. It's a simple helper function designed to standardize and clean up string inputs.

## Symbols

### `sanitize`
#### Description
The `sanitize` function takes a string input, converts it to lowercase using the locale-specific rules, and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. This function is useful for normalizing string inputs, which can be helpful in scenarios where case-insensitive comparisons or consistent string formatting is required.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| str | string | The input string to be sanitized |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The sanitized string, converted to lowercase and trimmed |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function applies `toLocaleLowerCase()` to the input string, which converts all characters to lowercase according to the current locale.
2. It then applies `trim()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace characters.
3. The resulting sanitized string is returned.

## Performance Considerations
The `sanitize` function uses built-in JavaScript string methods, which are generally optimized for performance. However, for very large strings or high-frequency usage, it's worth noting that both `toLocaleLowerCase()` and `trim()` create new string instances, which could have memory implications in extreme cases.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses only native JavaScript string methods.
