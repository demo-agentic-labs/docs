## High-level description
This code defines an `analyzeRoute` function that captures and analyzes API request data for analytics purposes. It filters out certain device-related routes and sends the collected data to an analytics service using the PostHog platform.

## Code Structure
The main function `analyzeRoute` takes request details as input, processes them, and conditionally sends analytics data. It relies on helper functions from other modules to extract customer IDs and interact with the analytics service.

## Symbols

### `devicesRoutes`
#### Description
An array of strings representing route names related to devices. These routes are excluded from analytics tracking.

### `analyzeRoute`
#### Description
A function that processes request data and sends it to the analytics service if the route is not device-related and a customer ID is present.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | Request | The Express request object |
| method | string | The HTTP method of the request |
| url | string | The URL of the request |
| params | Record&lt;string, string&gt; \| undefined | URL parameters |
| query | QueryString.ParsedQs \| undefined | Query string parameters |
| duration | number | The duration of the request processing |
| status | number | The HTTP status code of the response |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract customer IDs from the request using `getCxId` and `getCxIdFromHeaders`.
2. Check if the URL includes any of the device routes.
3. If the route is not device-related and a customer ID is present, send analytics data using the `analytics` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express | For type definitions (Request) |
| qs | For type definitions (ParsedQs) |
| @metriport/core/external/analytics/posthog | For sending analytics data |

## Performance Considerations
The function filters out device-related routes to reduce unnecessary analytics tracking, which can help optimize performance and reduce data volume.
