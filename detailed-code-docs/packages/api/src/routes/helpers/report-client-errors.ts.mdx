## High-level description
This code defines helper functions and middleware for handling client-side error reporting in an Express.js application. It provides a mechanism to flag requests for client error reporting and a middleware function to enable this feature for specific routes.

## Symbols

### `reportClientErrorsProp`
#### Description
A constant string used as a key to store the client error reporting flag on the request object.

### `setReportClientErrors`
#### Description
A function that sets a flag on the request object to indicate that client errors should be reported.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | Request | The Express request object |

#### Internal Logic
The function adds a boolean property to the request object using the `reportClientErrorsProp` key, setting it to `true`.

### `isReportClientErrors`
#### Description
A function that checks if the client error reporting flag is set on the request object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | Request | The Express request object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | boolean \| undefined | Whether client error reporting is enabled for this request |

#### Internal Logic
The function retrieves the value of the property set by `setReportClientErrors` from the request object.

### `reportClientErrors`
#### Description
An Express middleware function that enables client error reporting for a specific route.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | Request | The Express request object |
| res | Response | The Express response object |
| next | NextFunction | The Express next function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `setReportClientErrors` to enable client error reporting for the current request.
2. Calls the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware.

## Side Effects
The `setReportClientErrors` and `reportClientErrors` functions modify the request object by adding a custom property. This property is later used by the error handling middleware to determine whether to report client errors.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express | Provides types for Express.js Request, Response, and NextFunction |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't directly handle errors but sets up a mechanism for other parts of the application (likely the error handling middleware) to determine whether client errors should be reported.

## TODOs
The code includes two ESLint disable comments for the `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule. These might be considered TODOs for future type improvements:

1. In `setReportClientErrors`: `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
2. In `isReportClientErrors`: `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`

These comments suggest that the type of the request object is being explicitly cast to `any` to allow for the addition of a custom property. A more type-safe approach could be investigated in the future.
