## High-level description
This code defines a helper function `getProviderDataForType` that retrieves health data of a specific type from multiple connected providers for a given user and date. It handles the process of fetching data from each provider, managing errors, and aggregating the results.

## Code Structure
The main function `getProviderDataForType` uses several utility functions and constants to extract request parameters, fetch user information, and interact with different providers. It then processes the data from all providers and returns the aggregated results.

## References
This code references several other parts of the codebase, including:
- Constants and types from `../../providers/provider` and `../../shared/constants`
- Utility functions from `../schemas/timezone-id`, `../schemas/user-id`, and `../util`
- The `getConnectedUserOrFail` function from `../../command/connected-user/get-connected-user`

## Symbols

### `getProviderDataForType&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves health data of a specific type from all connected providers for a given user and date.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | Request | The Express request object |
| type | ConsumerHealthDataType | The type of health data to retrieve |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | T[] | An array of health data objects from all providers |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract necessary parameters from the request (cxId, userId, date, timezoneId).
2. Fetch the connected user information.
3. For each connected provider that supports the specified data type:
   - Queue up a request to fetch data from that provider.
   - Handle any errors by logging them and including an error message in the result.
4. Wait for all requests to complete using `Promise.allSettled`.
5. Aggregate successful results into the `data` array.
6. Return the aggregated data.

## Side Effects
This function does not have any side effects beyond logging errors to the console.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment suggesting to create separate functions for each data type to avoid potential type mismatching on the caller's side.
