## High-level description
This code defines an Express router for handling organization-related HTTP requests in a medical API. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving organizations, integrating with a database and potentially with Health Information Exchanges (HIEs).

## Code Structure
The code defines three main routes: POST for creating an organization, PUT for updating an organization, and GET for retrieving an organization. Each route uses middleware for request logging and error handling, and calls specific command functions to perform the requested operations.

## References
This code references several external modules and functions:
- Command functions: `createOrganization`, `updateOrganization`, `getOrganization`
- Utility functions: `getETag`, `asyncHandler`, `getCxIdOrFail`, `getFromQuery`, `getFromParamsOrFail`
- DTO function: `dtoFromModel`
- Schema validation: `organizationCreateSchema`, `organizationUpdateSchema`, `organizationBizTypeSchema`

## Symbols

### router
#### Description
An Express router instance created using `express-promise-router`.

### POST "/"
#### Description
Handles the creation of a new organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req.body | object | The data to create the organization |
| req.query.organizationBizType | string (optional) | The organization business type |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | Response | HTTP response with the created organization data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts customer ID and organization business type from the request
2. Validates the request body using `organizationCreateSchema`
3. Calls `createOrganization` command with the extracted data
4. Returns the created organization as a DTO with a 201 (Created) status code

### PUT "/:id"
#### Description
Handles the update of an existing organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req.params.id | string | The ID of the organization to update |
| req.body | object | The data to update the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | Response | HTTP response with the updated organization data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts customer ID and organization ID from the request
2. Validates the request body using `organizationUpdateSchema`
3. Calls `updateOrganization` command with the extracted data and ETag
4. Returns the updated organization as a DTO with a 200 (OK) status code

### GET "/"
#### Description
Retrieves the organization corresponding to the customer ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req.headers | object | Contains the customer ID |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | Response | HTTP response with the organization data or undefined |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts customer ID from the request
2. Calls `getOrganization` command with the customer ID
3. Returns the organization as a DTO or undefined with a 200 (OK) status code

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express | Web framework for handling HTTP requests |
| express-promise-router | Router for handling asynchronous routes |
| http-status | HTTP status codes |

## Error Handling
The code uses the `asyncHandler` wrapper for all route handlers, which likely handles any thrown errors and sends appropriate error responses.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | POST | Organization create data | Created organization | Creates a new organization |
| /:id | PUT | Organization update data | Updated organization | Updates an existing organization |
| / | GET | - | Organization data | Retrieves the organization for the customer |

This API handles organization management for a medical system, allowing creation, updates, and retrieval of organization data. It integrates with a database and potentially with Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) to maintain consistent organization information across systems.
