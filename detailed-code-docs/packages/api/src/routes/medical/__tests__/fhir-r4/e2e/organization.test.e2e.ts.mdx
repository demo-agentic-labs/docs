## High-level description
This file contains end-to-end (e2e) tests for the FHIR R4 Organization resource. It tests the creation, retrieval, and deletion of an organization using the FHIR API endpoints. The tests ensure that the API correctly handles CRUD operations for the Organization resource.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a Jest test suite with multiple test cases. It uses the `api` object from a shared test utility file to make HTTP requests to the FHIR API endpoints. The tests create an organization, retrieve it, and then delete it, validating the responses at each step.

## References
- `api` from "../../../../../__tests__/e2e/shared"
- `makeOrganization` from "./organization"

## Symbols

### `describe("Integration FHIR Org", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the FHIR Organization resource. It contains individual test cases for creating, retrieving, and deleting an organization.

### `test("create org", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the creation of an organization using a PUT request.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a PUT request to create an organization
2. Expects a 201 status code
3. Validates the response body using the `validateOrg` function

### `test("get org", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of a previously created organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a GET request to retrieve the organization
2. Expects a 200 status code
3. Validates the response body using the `validateOrg` function

### `describe("delete", ...)`
#### Description
A nested describe block for deletion-related tests.

### `test("delete org", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the deletion of the organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a DELETE request to remove the organization
2. Validates the delete response using `validateDeleteResponse`

### `test("sequential delete org", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to delete an already deleted organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends another DELETE request for the same organization
2. Validates the delete response, expecting a different status code

### `validateOrg(body: any)`
#### Description
A helper function to validate the structure and content of an organization resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | any  | The response body to validate |

#### Internal Logic
Checks various properties of the organization resource, such as resourceType, id, and identifier.

### `validateDeleteResponse(res: AxiosResponse, expectedResponse: string)`
#### Description
A helper function to validate the response of a delete operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | AxiosResponse | The API response object |
| expectedResponse | string | The expected response code |

#### Internal Logic
Validates the structure of the OperationOutcome resource returned after a delete operation.

## TODOs
1. TODO 1634: Fix and re-enable the "search org by name" test, which is currently failing in production.
2. There's a commented-out test for "get all orgs" that fails on the second run. This might need debugging in the future.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| axios | Used for making HTTP requests to the API |
| jest | Testing framework |

Note: The test suite uses a longer timeout (15000ms) due to the nature of e2e tests potentially taking longer than unit tests.
