## High-level description
This directory contains end-to-end (e2e) tests for FHIR R4 resources, specifically focusing on Document, Organization, and Patient resources. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the API endpoints for creating, retrieving, searching, and deleting these resources. The test suite ensures that the API correctly handles CRUD operations and adheres to the FHIR R4 specification.

## What does it do?
The e2e tests in this directory simulate real-world usage of the FHIR R4 API by:

1. Creating new resources (Documents, Organizations, and Patients) using PUT requests.
2. Retrieving created resources using GET requests.
3. Searching for resources based on specific criteria (e.g., patient name).
4. Deleting resources and verifying the deletion process.
5. Testing edge cases, such as attempting to delete already deleted resources.

These tests help ensure that the API behaves correctly and consistently across different FHIR resource types, maintaining data integrity and following the FHIR R4 standard.

## Key Files
1. `document.test.e2e.ts`: Contains tests for Binary and DocumentReference resources, including upload, download, and deletion operations.

2. `organization.test.e2e.ts`: Includes tests for the Organization resource, covering creation, retrieval, and deletion of organizations.

3. `patient.test.e2e.ts`: Focuses on Patient resource tests, including creation, retrieval, search by name, and deletion operations.

4. `organization.ts`: Provides a utility function `makeOrganization` for generating test data for Organization resources.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Jest: The testing framework used for running the e2e tests.
2. Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
3. @faker-js/faker: Generates fake data for testing purposes.
4. @metriport/core: Internal module providing utility functions and test data generators.

## Configuration
The tests use the following configuration:

1. Jest timeout is set to 15000ms to accommodate potentially slower e2e test execution.
2. Environment variables are loaded using dotenv, likely for API endpoint configuration.

Here's an example of how the tests are structured, using the Patient resource as an example:

```typescript
describe("Integration FHIR Patient", () =&gt; {
  test("create patient", async () =&gt; {
    const patient = makePatient();
    const res = await api.put(`/Patient/${patient.id}`, patient);
    expect(res.status).toBe(201);
    validatePatient(res.data);
  });

  test("get patient", async () =&gt; {
    const res = await api.get(`/Patient/${patientId}`);
    expect(res.status).toBe(200);
    validatePatient(res.data);
  });

  // Additional tests for search and delete operations
});
```

The tests use helper functions like `validatePatient` to ensure the API responses conform to the expected FHIR R4 structure:

```typescript
function validatePatient(body: any) {
  expect(body).toBeDefined();
  expect(body.resourceType).toBe("Patient");
  expect(body.id).toBeDefined();
  expect(body.identifier).toBeDefined();
  expect(body.identifier).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
  expect(body.identifier.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  // Additional validations...
}
```

These e2e tests provide comprehensive coverage of the FHIR R4 API functionality, ensuring that the API behaves correctly and consistently across different resource types and operations.
