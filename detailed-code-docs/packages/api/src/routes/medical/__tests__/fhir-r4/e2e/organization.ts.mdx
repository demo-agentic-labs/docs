## High-level description
This code defines a function `makeOrganization` that creates a FHIR R4 Organization resource with predefined structure and some customizable fields. It's primarily used for testing purposes, providing a consistent way to generate Organization resources with unique identifiers.

## Symbols

### `makeOrganization`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an object representing a FHIR R4 Organization resource. It uses a default or provided ID to generate a unique organization with predefined structure and some fixed values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Optional. A unique identifier for the organization. If not provided, a default ID is used. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Object | A FHIR R4 compliant Organization resource object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses a default ID if none is provided, which is a combination of a fixed prefix and a unique `nanoid`.
2. It constructs an object with the following properties:
   - `resourceType`: Set to "Organization"
   - `id`: The provided or default ID
   - `identifier`: An array with a single identifier object
   - `type`: An array with a single type object describing a healthcare provider
   - `name`: A string combining "HOSPITAL" and the ID
   - `telecom`: An array with a single telecom object (phone number)
   - `address`: An array with a single address object

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| nanoid | Imported from a shared test utility file to generate unique identifiers |

## References
The code references the `nanoid` function from the file `packages/api/src/__tests__/e2e/shared.ts`.

## Notes
1. This code is likely part of a test suite for FHIR R4 Organization resources.
2. The use of `nanoid` ensures that each generated Organization has a unique identifier, which is crucial for testing scenarios.
3. The fixed values (like the phone number, address, etc.) are probably placeholder data for testing purposes and may not represent real organizations.
4. The code follows the FHIR R4 specification for the Organization resource structure.
