## High-level description
This file contains end-to-end (e2e) tests for the medical document routes in an API. It specifically tests the GET endpoint of the "/medical/v1/document" path, verifying that it correctly interacts with a FHIR server to retrieve patient documents.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized using Jest, with a single describe block for the "Integration Document routes" and a nested describe block for the GET endpoint. It uses a shared API instance and a utility function to create mock patient data.

## Symbols

### `describe("Integration Document routes", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the document routes integration tests.

### `describe("GET /", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the GET endpoint of the document routes.

### `it("returns response from FHIR server", async () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the GET endpoint returns a response from the FHIR server.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock patient using `makePatient()` with a randomly generated UUID.
2. Sends a GET request to the document endpoint with the patient ID as a parameter.
3. Expects a 200 status code and a truthy response data.
4. Handles a potential 404 error, assuming it's due to the FHIR server not finding the patient.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Generates fake data for testing |
| ../../../domain/medical/__tests__/patient | Provides the `makePatient` utility function |
| ../../../__tests__/e2e/shared | Provides the shared `api` instance for making requests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| jest.setTimeout | number | 15000 | Sets the timeout for Jest tests to 15 seconds |

## Error Handling
The test case includes a try-catch block to handle potential errors:
- If a 404 error is encountered, it logs a message assuming the FHIR server couldn't find the patient.
- For other errors, it logs the error and re-throws it.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out line that uses a specific patient ID instead of a randomly generated one:
```typescript
// const patient = makePatient({ id: "2.16.840.1.113883.3.9621.5.2005.2.100" });
```
This might be useful for debugging or testing with a known patient ID in the future.
