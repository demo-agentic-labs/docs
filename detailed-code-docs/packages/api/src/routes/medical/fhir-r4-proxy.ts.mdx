## High-level description
This code defines a proxy router for FHIR R4 requests. It forwards requests to a FHIR server, modifying the request path and response data. If the FHIR server URL is not configured, it returns a "Not Found" error.

## Code Structure
The main components are:
1. `fhirRouter`: A proxy function that handles FHIR requests.
2. `dummyRouter`: A router that returns a "Not Found" error when FHIR server is disabled.
3. `router`: The exported router, which is either `fhirRouter` or `dummyRouter` based on the FHIR server configuration.

## Symbols

### `fhirRouter`
#### Description
Creates a proxy router for FHIR R4 requests using the `express-http-proxy` library.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fhirServerUrl | string | The URL of the FHIR server to proxy requests to |

#### Internal Logic
1. Modifies the request path by adding `/fhir/{cxId}` to the original URL.
2. Logs original headers and URL, and the updated URL.
3. Modifies the response data by replacing the API URL with the base URL.

### `dummyRouter`
#### Description
A router that returns a "Not Found" error for all requests when the FHIR server is disabled.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `asyncHandler` to throw a `NotFoundError` with the message "FHIR server is disabled".

### `router`
#### Description
The main router exported by the module. It's either `fhirRouter` or `dummyRouter` based on whether `fhirServerUrl` is configured.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express-http-proxy | Used to create the proxy router |
| express-promise-router | Used to create the dummy router |
| ../../errors/not-found | Provides the NotFoundError class |
| ../../shared/config | Provides configuration settings |
| ../../shared/util | Provides logging utility |
| ../util | Provides utility functions for request handling |

## Configuration
The code relies on the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| FHIR_SERVER_URL | string | The URL of the FHIR server to proxy requests to |

## Error Handling
- If the FHIR server URL is not configured, all requests will result in a NotFoundError with the message "FHIR server is disabled".
- Any errors occurring during the proxy request will be handled by the express-http-proxy library.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging utility (`log` function) to log:
- Original request headers
- Original request URL
- Updated URL for proxying to the FHIR server

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
