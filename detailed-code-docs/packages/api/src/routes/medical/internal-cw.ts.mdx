## High-level description
This code defines a router for internal CommonWell operations, including retrieving and updating organizations and facilities. It provides endpoints for getting organization details, updating organization status, and updating facility status within the CommonWell network.

## Code Structure
The code exports a router with three main endpoints:
1. GET /ops/organization/:oid - Retrieves organization details
2. PUT /ops/organization/:oid - Updates organization status
3. PUT /ops/facility/:oid - Updates facility status

Each endpoint uses middleware for request logging and error handling.
