## High-level description
This code defines schemas for creating, updating, and managing facility data in a medical API. It uses Zod for schema validation and includes specific schemas for facility creation, updating, and internal details.

## Code Structure
The code defines three main schemas: `facilityCreateSchema`, `facilityUpdateSchema`, and `facilityInternalDetailsSchema`. These schemas are used to validate and structure data related to medical facilities.

## Symbols

### `facilityCreateSchema`
#### Description
Defines the schema for creating a new facility.

#### Internal Logic
- Validates facility name, NPI, TIN, active status, and address.
- Uses custom validation for NPI using the `validateNPI` function.

### `facilityUpdateSchema`
#### Description
Defines the schema for updating an existing facility. It is identical to the `facilityCreateSchema`.

### `facilityInternalDetailsSchema`
#### Description
Defines an extended schema for internal facility details, including additional fields for Carequality (CQ) and CommonWell (CW) integration.

#### Internal Logic
- Includes all fields from `facilityCreateSchema`.
- Adds fields for internal ID, name in Metriport, and various CQ and CW related properties.
- Uses `FacilityType` enum for CQ and CW type fields.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/commonwell-sdk | Provides `validateNPI` function for NPI validation |
| zod | Used for schema definition and validation |
| ../../../domain/medical/facility | Imports `FacilityType` enum |

## References
- `AddressStrictSchema` from "./address"
- `optionalString` from "./shared"
- `validateNPI` from "@metriport/commonwell-sdk"
- `FacilityType` from "../../../domain/medical/facility"

## Error Handling
The schemas include built-in error handling through Zod's validation. For example, the NPI field uses a custom refinement to ensure it's valid using the `validateNPI` function.

## API/Interface Reference
While not explicitly defining an API, these schemas form the basis for validating input in API routes related to facility management. They define the expected structure and types for facility-related operations.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | Facility name (min length 1) |
| npi | string | National Provider Identifier (10 digits, validated) |
| tin | string | Optional Tax Identification Number |
| active | boolean | Optional facility active status |
| address | object | Strict address object |
| id | string | Optional internal ID |
| nameInMetriport | string | Facility name in Metriport system |
| cqApproved, cwApproved | boolean | Optional approval status for CQ and CW |
| cqType, cwType | enum | Facility type for CQ and CW |
| cqActive, cwActive | boolean | Optional active status for CQ and CW |
| cqOboOid, cwOboOid | string | Optional OBO OIDs for CQ and CW |

This schema definition ensures that all facility-related data is properly structured and validated before being processed or stored in the system.
