## High-level description
This file contains various route handlers and utility functions for the Carequality integration in the Metriport API. It includes endpoints for managing the Carequality directory, handling patient discovery, document queries, and document retrievals. The code interacts with external Carequality services and internal Metriport systems to facilitate health information exchange.

## Code Structure
The file defines several Express.js route handlers for different Carequality-related operations. It also includes utility functions for processing responses, managing patient data, and interacting with the Carequality directory. The code relies on various imported functions and models from other parts of the Metriport system.
