## High-level description
This code defines a router for medical-related routes in an Express.js application. It imports and sets up sub-routes for facilities, organizations, patients, and documents, creating a modular structure for handling medical data endpoints.

## Code Structure
The code imports sub-routers for different medical entities and combines them into a single router. Each sub-router is assigned to a specific path, creating a hierarchical structure for the API endpoints.

## Symbols

### `routes`
#### Description
An instance of `express-promise-router` that serves as the main router for medical-related endpoints.

#### Internal Logic
The router uses the `use` method to attach sub-routers to specific paths:
- `/facility` for facility-related routes
- `/organization` for organization-related routes
- `/patient` for patient-related routes
- `/document` for document-related routes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express-promise-router | Used to create an Express router that supports promises |
| ./facility | Sub-router for facility-related routes |
| ./organization | Sub-router for organization-related routes |
| ./patient | Sub-router for patient-related routes |
| ./document | Sub-router for document-related routes |

## References
The code references other modules within the project:
- `facility`: Likely handles facility-related operations
- `organization`: Likely handles organization-related operations
- `patient`: Likely handles patient-related operations
- `document`: Likely handles document-related operations

These modules are imported and used to set up the respective sub-routes.

While not directly referenced in this file, the related code snippets provide insights into the structure of the medical data models and operations:

1. The `packages/api-sdk/src/medical/models/facility.ts` file defines schemas for facility data, including creation and validation rules.

2. The `packages/api/src/command/medical/patient/convert-fhir-to-cda.ts` file contains a function for converting FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format, which might be used in the patient or document routes.

These related files suggest that the medical routes defined in this index file are part of a larger system for managing healthcare data, including facilities, patients, and document conversions between different healthcare data standards.
