## High-level description
This code defines an Express router for handling internal HIE (Health Information Exchange) related operations. It specifically provides an endpoint to retrieve an overview of a patient's status across different HIEs.

## Code Structure
The main structure of this code is a single Express router with one GET endpoint. It uses various utility functions and schemas for request handling and validation.

## Symbols

### `router`
#### Description
An Express router instance created using `express-promise-router`.

### `debugLevelSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the allowed values for the `debugLevel` query parameter.

### GET `/patient/overview`
#### Description
This endpoint retrieves the overall status of a patient across HIEs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | UUID (query parameter) | The patient's ID |
| facilityId | UUID (optional query parameter) | The facility ID |
| debugLevel | Enum: "info" \| "success" \| "error" (optional query parameter) | The level of details to include in the overview |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | JSON | The HIE overview for the patient |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts and validates the `patientId` from the query parameters.
2. Optionally extracts the `facilityId` from the query parameters.
3. Parses and validates the `debugLevel` from the query parameters, defaulting to "info" if not provided.
4. Calls the `getHieOverview` function with the extracted parameters.
5. Returns the response with a 200 OK status.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dayjs | Date manipulation library |
| express | Web application framework |
| express-promise-router | Router for handling asynchronous routes |
| http-status | HTTP status codes |
| zod | Schema validation |

## References
- `getHieOverview` from "../../command/medical/admin/hie-overview"
- `requestLogger` from "../helpers/request-logger"
- `getUUIDFrom` from "../schemas/uuid"
- `asyncHandler`, `getFrom` from "../util"

## Error Handling
The code uses `asyncHandler` to wrap the route handler, which likely handles any errors thrown within the handler. The `getUUIDFrom` function is used with `.orFail()`, which suggests it throws an error if the UUID is not valid or not present.

## Notes
- The code extends dayjs with the duration plugin, but it's not clear where this is used within this file.
- The `facilityId` is only needed if the patient is associated with more than one facility and the `debugLevel` is not "info".
- The different debug levels ("info", "success", "error") provide varying levels of detail in the overview, which can be useful for different purposes such as enhancing patient demographics or diagnosing issues with HIE linking.
