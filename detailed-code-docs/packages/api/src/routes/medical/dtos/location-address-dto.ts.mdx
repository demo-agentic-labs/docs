### `AddressStrictDTO`
#### Description
`AddressStrictDTO` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure for a strict address data transfer object. It contains fields commonly used to represent a physical address, with some fields being optional.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| addressLine1 | string | Yes | The primary address line (e.g., street number and name) |
| addressLine2 | string | No | An optional secondary address line (e.g., apartment or suite number) |
| city | string | Yes | The name of the city |
| state | string | Yes | The state or province |
| zip | string | Yes | The postal or ZIP code |
| country | string | Yes | The country name |

#### Internal Logic
The type uses TypeScript's structural typing to define a strict shape for address objects. The `?` after `addressLine2` indicates that this field is optional, while all other fields are required.

## References
The `AddressStrictDTO` type is referenced in the related file `facilityDTO.ts`, where it is used as part of the `FacilityDTO` and `InternalFacilityDTO` types. This indicates that the address structure is likely used consistently across the application for representing facility locations.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It relies solely on TypeScript's type system.

## Usage Context
Based on the related code snippet, we can infer that `AddressStrictDTO` is used in the context of medical facilities. It's part of a larger data structure representing a medical facility, which includes other information such as the facility's name, NPI (National Provider Identifier), and tax identification number.

The strict nature of this DTO (Data Transfer Object) suggests that it's designed to ensure data consistency and completeness when transferring address information between different parts of the application or when communicating with external systems or APIs.
