## References
The `DocumentBulkUrlDTO` type is referenced in the related file `packages/api/src/command/medical/document/document-webhook.ts`. It is used in the following contexts:

1. As a possible type for the `documents` property in the `WebhookDocumentDataPayload` type.
2. As a possible type for the `documents` parameter in the `processPatientDocumentRequest` function.

This suggests that `DocumentBulkUrlDTO` is used in webhook-related operations, specifically for handling bulk document downloads in a medical context.

## Dependencies
The code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a simple type definition using TypeScript's built-in types.

## Notes
1. The `description`, `mimeType`, and `size` properties are optional, indicated by the `?` after their names.
2. The `size` property is specifically noted to be in bytes, which is important for correct interpretation of the value.
3. This DTO (Data Transfer Object) is likely used to transfer document information between different parts of the application, particularly in API responses or webhook payloads related to bulk document downloads.
