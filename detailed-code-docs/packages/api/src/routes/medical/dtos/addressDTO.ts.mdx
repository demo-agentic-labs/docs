## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript type `AddressDTO` that represents an address structure. It is used to standardize the format of address information within the application, particularly in the context of medical routes and patient data.

### `AddressDTO`
#### Description
`AddressDTO` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure for an address. It includes common address components, with most fields being optional except for the zip code.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| addressLine1 | string (optional) | The first line of the address |
| addressLine2 | string (optional) | The second line of the address, if applicable |
| city | string (optional) | The city name |
| state | string (optional) | The state or province |
| zip | string | The postal code or ZIP code (required) |
| country | string (optional) | The country name |

#### Outputs
As a type definition, it doesn't produce outputs. It's used to type-check and structure address data throughout the application.

## References
The `AddressDTO` type is referenced in the related file `demographicsDTO.ts`, where it's used as part of the `DemographicsDTO` type. Specifically, the `address` field in `DemographicsDTO` is defined as an array of `AddressDTO` objects.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in type system.

## Notes
1. The `zip` field is the only required field in this DTO, which is unusual for address structures. This might be intentional if the application considers the ZIP code as the minimum required information for an address.
2. All other fields are optional, allowing for flexibility in address representation. This could be useful for international addresses or cases where complete address information is not available.
3. The use of `?` for optional fields allows for partial address information to be stored and transmitted without causing type errors.
4. This DTO is likely used for data transfer between different parts of the application, particularly when dealing with patient demographics in a medical context, as evidenced by its usage in the `demographicsDTO.ts` file.
