## High-level description
This directory contains Data Transfer Object (DTO) definitions and related utility functions for the medical routes of an API. These DTOs are used to standardize the structure of data exchanged between the API and its clients, ensuring consistent and well-defined data formats for various medical entities such as patients, organizations, facilities, and documents.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves several key purposes:

1. Defines standardized data structures (DTOs) for various medical entities, including patients, organizations, facilities, addresses, and documents.
2. Provides conversion functions to transform domain models into their corresponding DTO representations.
3. Handles the transformation of external data formats (e.g., CommonWell) into the API's standardized DTO formats.
4. Separates internal and external representations of data, allowing for different levels of detail and security in API responses.
5. Ensures type safety and consistency in data handling throughout the API.

These DTOs and utility functions work together to create a consistent interface for data exchange, making it easier to manage and evolve the API's data structures over time.

## Key Files

### addressDTO.ts
Defines the `AddressDTO` type for representing address information.

### baseDTO.ts
Provides a `BaseDTO` type and `toBaseDTO` function for common DTO properties like `id` and `eTag`.

### codeableDTO.ts
Defines DTOs and conversion functions for CodeableConcept and Coding entities used in medical data.

### demographicsDTO.ts
Contains the `DemographicsDTO` type and conversion function for patient demographic information.

### documentDTO.ts
Defines the `DocumentReferenceDTO` type and conversion function for document references.

### facilityDTO.ts
Provides DTOs and conversion functions for facility data, including both external and internal representations.

### linkDTO.ts
Contains DTOs and conversion functions for patient links, including handling of potential and current links.

### organizationDTO.ts
Defines DTOs and conversion functions for organization data, with separate external and internal representations.

### patientDTO.ts
Provides DTOs and conversion functions for patient data, including both external and internal representations.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @metriport/core: Provides domain models and utility functions.
2. @metriport/commonwell-sdk: Used for handling CommonWell-specific data structures.
3. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides FHIR resource type definitions.
4. lodash: Used for utility functions in data manipulation.

These dependencies allow the DTOs to accurately represent complex medical data structures and facilitate the conversion between different data formats.

The code in this directory plays a crucial role in maintaining a clean and consistent API interface, separating the internal data representations from the external ones, and ensuring type safety throughout the application. It provides a foundation for handling various medical entities in a standardized way, which is essential for building a robust and maintainable medical API.
