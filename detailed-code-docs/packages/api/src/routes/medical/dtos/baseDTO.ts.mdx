## High-level description
This code defines a base Data Transfer Object (DTO) structure and a utility function to convert a model to a BaseDTO. It serves as a foundation for other DTOs in the medical routes of the API, providing common fields like `id` and `eTag`.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main symbols: `BaseDTO` type and `toBaseDTO` function. The `BaseDTO` type is used as a base for other DTOs, while the `toBaseDTO` function is utilized to convert model objects to BaseDTO objects.

## Symbols

### `BaseDTO`
#### Description
A TypeScript type definition that represents the basic structure of a DTO in the system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the DTO |
| eTag | string | Entity tag for the DTO, typically used for caching and concurrency control |

### `toBaseDTO`
#### Description
A function that converts a model object with `id` and `eTag` properties to a `BaseDTO` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | \{ id: string; eTag: string \} | An object containing `id` and `eTag` properties |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| BaseDTO | BaseDTO | A new BaseDTO object with `id` and `eTag` properties |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply creates a new object with the `id` and `eTag` properties from the input model, effectively mapping the model to a BaseDTO structure.

## References
The `BaseDTO` type and `toBaseDTO` function are referenced in other files within the medical routes:

1. In `organizationDTO.ts`, they are used to create `OrganizationDTO` and `InternalOrganizationDTO` types, and in the `dtoFromModel` and `internalDtoFromModel` functions.
2. In `facilityDTO.ts`, they are used similarly for `FacilityDTO` and `InternalFacilityDTO` types, and in the corresponding `dtoFromModel` and `internalDtoFromModel` functions.
3. In `patientDTO.ts`, they are used in the `InternalPatientDTO` type and in the `dtoFromModel` and `internalDtoFromModel` functions.

These references demonstrate that the `BaseDTO` serves as a common foundation for various domain-specific DTOs in the medical routes of the API.
