## High-level description
This code defines a type alias `ContactDTO` that is equivalent to the `Contact` type imported from the `@metriport/core/domain/contact` module. It serves as a Data Transfer Object (DTO) representation of a contact in the medical routes of the API.

## Symbols

### `ContactDTO`
#### Description
`ContactDTO` is a type alias that directly maps to the `Contact` type. It represents the structure of contact information used in the API's medical routes.

#### Inputs
This type alias doesn't have inputs as it's not a function or method.

#### Outputs
The `ContactDTO` type is equivalent to the `Contact` type, which based on the related code snippet, is defined as:

```typescript
Partial&lt;Record&lt;ContactTypes, string | undefined&gt;&gt;
```

Where `ContactTypes` is:

```typescript
type ContactTypes = "email" | "phone";
```

This means `ContactDTO` is an object that may contain `email` and/or `phone` properties, both of which are optional and can be either a string or undefined.

## References
- The `Contact` type is imported from `@metriport/core/domain/contact`.
- `ContactDTO` is used in the `DemographicsDTO` type defined in the `demographicsDTO.ts` file, where it appears as an optional array property named `contact`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/contact | Imports the `Contact` type used to define `ContactDTO` |

This file is part of a larger system dealing with medical data and patient information. The `ContactDTO` type is used to represent contact information consistently across the API, ensuring that the structure of contact data remains uniform when transferred between different parts of the application or when communicating with external systems.
