## High-level description
This code defines an Express router for internal user-related operations in a devices API. It includes two main endpoints: one for refreshing user tokens and another for resubscribing Fitbit webhooks. These endpoints are designed to manage connected users and their provider connections.

## Code Structure
The code exports a router with two POST routes: "/refresh-tokens" and "/resubscribe-fitbit-webhooks". Both routes use the asyncHandler wrapper for error handling. They interact with connected users, their providers, and perform operations like token refreshing and webhook resubscription.

## Symbols

### Router
#### Description
An Express router instance that defines the routes for internal user operations.

### POST /refresh-tokens
#### Description
This endpoint attempts to refresh all users' tokens for each of their connected providers. If the refresh fails, it revokes the token locally and sends a webhook to notify the customer of the disconnect.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | UUID (optional) | The customer/account's ID |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| usersProcessed | number | Count of users processed |
| usersWithDisconnectedProviders | number | Count of users with disconnected providers |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieve connected users (filtered by cxId if provided)
2. For each user and provider:
   - Attempt to refresh the token
   - If refresh fails, update provider data and mark as disconnected
3. Send webhook for disconnected providers
4. Return counts of processed and disconnected users

### POST /resubscribe-fitbit-webhooks
#### Description
This endpoint finds all existing users connected to Fitbit and recreates their webhook subscriptions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | UUID (optional) | The customer/account's ID |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| usersProcessed | number | Count of users processed |
| usersAffected | number | Count of users affected |
| errorsCaught | object | Count and details of errors encountered |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieve connected users (filtered by cxId if provided)
2. For each user with a Fitbit provider:
   - Attempt to resubscribe to Fitbit webhooks
   - Track successful resubscriptions and errors
3. Return counts of processed users, affected users, and errors

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express | Web application framework |
| express-promise-router | Router for handling async routes |
| http-status | HTTP status codes |

## Error Handling
The code uses the `asyncHandler` wrapper for error handling in the routes. Specific error handling is implemented within the route handlers, particularly for the Fitbit webhook resubscription process.

## Logging
The code includes console.log statements for error logging, particularly in the Fitbit webhook resubscription process.
