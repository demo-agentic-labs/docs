## High-level description
This code defines a router for handling settings-related API endpoints in an Express.js application. It provides functionality for retrieving, creating, and updating settings, as well as managing webhook configurations and statuses.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around a main router object that defines various routes for handling different settings-related operations. It imports several helper functions and models from other parts of the application to handle database operations, error handling, and request processing.

## Symbols

### `router`
#### Description
An Express.js router object that defines the routes for settings-related operations.

### `SettingsDTO`
#### Description
A Data Transfer Object class for representing settings information.

#### Internal Logic
- Constructs a DTO with `id`, `webhookUrl`, and `webhookKey`.
- Provides a static method `fromEntity` to create a DTO from a Settings entity.

### `WebhookStatusDTO`
#### Description
A Data Transfer Object class for representing webhook status information.

#### Internal Logic
- Constructs a DTO with `webhookEnabled`, `webhookStatusDetail`, `webhookRequestsProcessing`, and `webhookRequestsFailed`.
- Provides a static method `fromEntity` to create a DTO from individual status components.

### `GET /`
#### Description
Retrieves or creates settings for the API customer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Gets the customer ID from the request.
2. Attempts to retrieve existing settings.
3. If settings don't exist, creates new settings.
4. Returns the settings as a SettingsDTO.

### `POST /`
#### Description
Updates the settings for the API customer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the incoming request body using a Zod schema.
2. Checks the webhook URL against a blacklist.
3. Updates the settings using the `updateSettings` function.
4. Returns the updated settings as a SettingsDTO.

### `GET /webhook`
#### Description
Retrieves webhook status information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Gets the customer ID from the request.
2. Retrieves the settings and counts of failed and processing webhook requests.
3. Returns the status information as a WebhookStatusDTO.

### `POST /webhook/retry`
#### Description
Retries failed webhook requests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Gets the customer ID from the request.
2. Calls the `retryFailedRequests` function to retry failed requests.
3. Returns a 200 OK status.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:
- Express.js for routing
- Zod for request validation
- Various internal modules for settings management, webhook handling, and error handling

## Error Handling
The code uses custom error classes (e.g., `BadRequestError`) and the `asyncHandler` wrapper to handle and propagate errors consistently.

## Configuration
The code defines constants for webhook URL validation, including blacklists for certain URL patterns and exact matches.

This router provides a comprehensive API for managing settings and webhook configurations, with proper error handling and data validation.
