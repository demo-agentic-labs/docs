## High-level description
This code defines a route handler for processing Apple webhook data in an Express.js application. It receives Apple data for various data types, validates and maps the data, and then processes it for a specific user.

## Code Structure
The main function of this code is the route handler for the POST request to "/webhook/apple". It utilizes several imported functions to process the incoming data, including `processAppleData`, `mapData`, `appleSchema`, and utility functions like `asyncHandler` and `getCxIdOrFail`.

## References
- `processAppleData` from "../../command/webhook/apple"
- `appleSchema` and `mapData` from "../../mappings/apple"
- `asyncHandler` and `getCxIdOrFail` from "../util"

### POST route handler
#### Description
This is an asynchronous route handler for POST requests to "/webhook/apple". It processes incoming Apple webhook data for a specific user.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | Request | The Express request object containing the webhook payload |
| res | Response | The Express response object for sending the response |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts `metriportUserId`, `hourly`, and `data` from the request body
2. Retrieves the customer ID (`cxId`) using `getCxIdOrFail`
3. Parses the `data` JSON string
4. Logs the `metriportUserId` and parsed payload for debugging
5. If there's no error in the payload:
   - Validates and maps the data using `appleSchema.parse` and `mapData`
   - Processes the mapped data using `processAppleData`
6. Sends a 200 status code response

#### Side Effects
- Logs debugging information to the console
- Processes Apple data, which may involve database operations or external API calls (in `processAppleData`)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express | Web application framework |
| express-promise-router | Router for handling asynchronous route handlers |

## Error Handling
The code uses `asyncHandler` to wrap the route handler, which likely handles any uncaught errors in the asynchronous function.

## TODOs
- Remove or refine the temporary logging for debugging purposes

## Notes
1. The code includes temporary logging for debugging purposes, which should be removed or refined in a production environment.
2. The `hourly` parameter is extracted from the request body but its purpose is not clear from this code snippet alone.
3. The error handling could be improved by sending appropriate error responses instead of always returning a 200 status code.
