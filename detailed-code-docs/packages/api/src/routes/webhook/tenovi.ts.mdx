## High-level description
This code defines a route for handling POST requests to the "/webhook/tenovi" endpoint. It processes Tenovi measurements by validating the incoming data against a schema and then processing the measurement data.

## Code Structure
The code exports a Router instance with a single POST route. The route uses an asyncHandler to process the request, validate the data, and send a response.

## References
- `asyncHandler` from "../util"
- `tenoviMeasurementSchema` from "../../mappings/tenovi"
- `processMeasurementData` from "../../command/webhook/tenovi"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express | Web framework for handling HTTP requests |
