## High-level description
This directory contains middleware functions for authentication, authorization, and usage reporting in an Express.js API. It includes implementations for OAuth1 and OAuth2 authentication, customer identification, device connection, and usage tracking. The middleware functions are designed to work with various healthcare providers and integrate with services like PropelAuth for user management.

## What does it do?
The middleware in this directory performs several key functions:

1. Authentication: It processes API keys, JWT tokens, and OAuth credentials to authenticate users and extract customer IDs.

2. Authorization: It checks if users have access to specific API features, such as the Medical API.

3. Device Management: It handles the connection and storage of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) device information for users.

4. OAuth Handling: It processes OAuth1 and OAuth2 authentication flows for various healthcare providers.

5. Usage Reporting: It tracks and reports usage data for different products and entities within the API.

These middleware functions work together to ensure that API requests are properly authenticated, authorized, and tracked. They also facilitate the integration of various healthcare providers and devices into the system.

## Key Files

### auth.ts
This file contains the core authentication middleware. It processes customer IDs from API keys and JWT tokens, and includes functions to check Medical API access. Key functions include:

- `processCxId`: Extracts customer ID from various sources and attaches it to the request.
- `getCxIdFromApiKey`: Extracts customer ID from an encoded API key.
- `getCxIdFromJwt`: Extracts customer ID from a JWT token using PropelAuth.
- `checkMAPIAccess`: Validates if a customer has access to the Medical API.

### oauth1.ts and oauth2.ts
These files handle OAuth1 and OAuth2 authentication flows respectively. They process tokens, verify them, and update connected user data. Key functions include:

- `processOAuth1`: Handles OAuth1 authentication for providers like Garmin.
- `processOAuth2`: Manages OAuth2 authentication for various providers.

### connect-device.ts
This file manages the connection of RPM devices to user accounts. The main function is:

- `saveRpmDevice`: Stores RPM device IDs and user ID in the provider map.

### propelauth.ts
This file provides authentication and authorization functionality using PropelAuth. Key functions include:

- `getAuth()`: Initializes and returns the PropelAuth object.
- `getCxId()`, `getRole()`, `getOrgMemberInfo()`: Extract user information from authenticated user objects.

### usage.ts
This file defines middleware for reporting API usage. The main functions are:

- `reportUsage`: Creates middleware to report usage for a given product and entity.
- `reportDeviceUsage`: Specific implementation for reporting device usage.

## Dependencies
The middleware relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

- Express.js: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
- PropelAuth: For user authentication and management.
- @metriport/core and @metriport/api-sdk: For various utility functions and types.
- Zod: For schema validation.
- jsonwebtoken: For JWT token handling.

Internal dependencies include various command modules for user and connected user management, error handling, and configuration settings.

## Configuration
The middleware uses environment variables and configuration files for settings such as:

- PropelAuth credentials and endpoints
- API key encoding and decoding
- OAuth client IDs and secrets for various providers

These configurations are typically loaded from the `../../shared/config` module.

In summary, this middleware directory provides a comprehensive set of functions to handle authentication, authorization, and usage tracking for a healthcare-related API. It supports various authentication methods and integrates with multiple healthcare providers and device types.
