## High-level description
This code defines a middleware function `saveRpmDevice` that stores a user's RPM (Remote Patient Monitoring) device IDs and user ID in the provider map. It also includes a helper function `getConnectedDeviceIds` to merge and return the IDs of all connected devices for the user.

## Code Structure
The main function `saveRpmDevice` uses several imported functions to authenticate the user, retrieve user information, and update the provider data. The `getConnectedDeviceIds` function is a helper that merges existing and new device IDs.

## Symbols

### `saveRpmDevice`
#### Description
This asynchronous function saves RPM device information for a user in the provider map.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| provider | RPMDeviceProviderOptions | A medical device provider (e.g., Tenovi) |
| token | string | Connect Token |
| deviceIds | string[] | A list of device IDs |
| deviceUserId | string | Device User ID |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| updatedConnectedUser | Promise&lt;ConnectedUser&gt; | The updated ConnectedUser object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the user token using the provided token
2. Extracts cxId and userId from the user token
3. Validates the presence of provider, cxId, and userId
4. Retrieves the connected user
5. Merges existing and new device IDs
6. Updates the provider data with new information
7. Returns the updated connected user

### `getConnectedDeviceIds`
#### Description
This function merges and returns the IDs of all connected devices for the user.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connectedUser | ConnectedUser | Connected User object |
| provider | RPMDeviceProviderOptions | A healthcare provider |
| deviceIds | string[] | A list of device IDs |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connectedDeviceIds | string[] | Merged list of unique device IDs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user has a provider map
2. If exists, merges previous connected devices with new device IDs
3. Removes duplicates using Set
4. If no provider map exists, returns the input deviceIds

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Importing types and constants |
| ../../command/connected-user/get-connected-user | Retrieving connected user information |
| ../../command/connected-user/save-connected-user | Updating provider data |
| ../../command/cx-user/get-user-token | Getting user token |
| ../../errors/unauthorized | Handling unauthorized errors |
| ../../models/connected-user | ConnectedUser model |
| ../../providers/tenovi | Tenovi-specific constants |
| ../../shared/constants | Shared constants and types |

## TODOs
- If duplicates are found in the device list, consider notifying the user that the device was already connected.

This code is part of a larger system for managing connected users and their devices in a healthcare-related application. It specifically handles the process of saving and updating RPM device information for users.
