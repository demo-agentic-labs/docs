title: "sleep.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a route handler for the GET /sleep endpoint in an Express.js application. It retrieves sleep data for all connected providers for a specified user ID and date, utilizing the `getProviderDataForType` helper function to fetch and aggregate the data.

## Code Structure
The main component is the route handler, which uses the `asyncHandler` wrapper for error handling. It relies on the `getProviderDataForType` function to fetch sleep data from multiple providers.

## References
- `getProviderDataForType` from "./helpers/provider-route-helper"
- `asyncHandler` from "./util"
- `ConsumerHealthDataType` from "../providers/provider"

## Symbols

### router
#### Description
An instance of Express Router used to define the GET /sleep route.

### GET / route handler
#### Description
Handles GET requests to the /sleep endpoint, fetching sleep data for the specified user and date.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req.query.userId | string | The user ID to fetch sleep data for |
| req.query.date | string | The date to fetch sleep data for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res.body | Sleep[] | An array of Sleep objects containing the user's sleep data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `getProviderDataForType` with the request object and `ConsumerHealthDataType.Sleep`.
2. Sets the response status to OK (200) and sends the results as JSON.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides the Sleep type |
| express | Web application framework |
| http-status | HTTP status codes |
| express-promise-router | Router that allows use of async functions |

## Error Handling
Error handling is managed by the `asyncHandler` wrapper, which catches any errors thrown in the route handler and passes them to the next middleware.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /sleep | GET | Query params: userId, date | Sleep[] | Fetches sleep data for the specified user and date from all connected providers |

The `getProviderDataForType` function (from the related code snippets) is crucial for understanding how the sleep data is fetched. It retrieves data from multiple providers for the specified user, date, and data type (in this case, sleep data). It handles potential errors from individual providers and aggregates the results into a single array.

The `asyncHandler` function (from the util.ts snippet) is used to wrap the route handler, providing consistent error handling and logging across routes.
