## High-level description
This file defines the routes and handlers for user-related operations in the Metriport API. It includes endpoints for retrieving user data, creating and managing connected users, generating authentication tokens, and handling provider connections and revocations.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a series of route definitions using Express.js. It imports various functions and types from other parts of the application, such as command handlers, error classes, and provider-specific logic. The main router object is created using `express-promise-router`, and each route is defined with its corresponding handler function.

## Symbols

### `router`
#### Description
An Express router object that defines the routes for user-related operations.

### `listConnectedUsers`
#### Description
An async function that retrieves a list of all connected users for a given customer.

#### Inputs

| req | Request | The Express request object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connectedUsers | ConnectedUserInfo[] | An array of connected user information |

### `revokeUserProviderAccess`
#### Description
An async function that revokes a user's access to a specific provider.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connectedUser | ConnectedUser | The connected user object |
| provider | any | The provider to revoke access from |
| req | Request | The Express request object |

### `revokeToken`
#### Description
An async function that handles the revocation of a provider token for a user.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | Request | The Express request object |
| res | Response | The Express response object |
| userId | string | The ID of the user |

### `removeDevice`
#### Description
An async function that removes a device from a user's profile.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connectedUser | ConnectedUser | The connected user object |
| provider | string | The device provider |
| deviceId | string | The ID of the device to disconnect |
| rawParams | RawParams | Additional parameters for the operation |

## Routes

### GET /user
Retrieves user data for all connected providers for a specified user ID and date.

### POST /user
Creates a new connected user or returns the existing user ID associated with the customer's user ID.

### GET /user/connect/token
Generates an authentication token for a connect widget session for a specified user ID.

### DELETE /user/:userId/revoke
Revokes access to a specific provider for a user.

### DELETE /user/:userId
Revokes access to all providers and permanently deletes the user.

### GET /user/:userId/connected-providers
Retrieves the list of connected providers for a user.

### DELETE /user/:userId/device

## Dependencies
The code relies on various external libraries and internal modules, including Express.js, HTTP status codes, and custom error classes.

## Error Handling
The code uses custom error classes like `BadRequestError` and `NotFoundError` to handle specific error scenarios. It also uses the `asyncHandler` wrapper to catch and forward errors to the Express error handling middleware.

## Configuration
The code uses the `Config` class to access environment-specific configuration values, such as sandbox user limits.
