## High-level description
The `reportUsage` function in `report-usage.ts` is responsible for asynchronously sending usage data to a configured endpoint. This data includes customer ID, entity ID, product type, and whether a document query was involved.

## References
- `Config.getUsageUrl()`: Retrieves the URL of the usage reporting endpoint from the application configuration.
- `capture.error()`: Reports an error to an error tracking service (likely Sentry).

### `reportUsage`
#### Description
This function sends usage data to a predefined endpoint. It's designed to be asynchronous, meaning it doesn't block the execution flow and handles potential errors internally.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |
| entityId | string | The ID of the entity associated with the usage (e.g., user ID). |
| product | Product | An enum value representing the product being used. |
| docQuery | boolean | (Optional) Indicates whether the usage involved a document query. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value (void).

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the usage reporting URL from the configuration.
2. If the URL is not configured, the function exits early.
3. Constructs a payload object containing the usage data.
4. Sends a POST request to the configured URL with the payload.
5. If the request fails, logs an error message to the console and reports the error to an error tracking service.

## Side Effects
- Sends a POST request to the configured usage reporting endpoint.
- Logs an error message to the console if the request fails.
- Reports errors to an error tracking service.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Axios | Used for making HTTP requests to the usage reporting endpoint. |
| json-stringify-safe | Used for safely stringifying the payload object, handling circular references. |
| Config | Provides access to application configuration, including the usage reporting URL. |
| capture | Provides error reporting functionality. |

## Error Handling
- Errors during the HTTP request are caught and handled within the function.
- Error messages are logged to the console.
- Errors are reported to an error tracking service.
