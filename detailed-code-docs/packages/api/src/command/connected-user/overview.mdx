## High-level description
This directory contains a set of functions for managing connected users in an API. It provides functionality for creating, deleting, retrieving, and updating connected user records in a database. The connected user concept appears to be a way of linking users from external systems or providers to the application's internal user system.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory handles various operations related to connected users:

1. Creating new connected user records with unique IDs and associating them with client applications and external user IDs.
2. Deleting connected user records from the database.
3. Retrieving connected user information based on various criteria such as ID, customer ID, provider token, or device ID.
4. Updating provider-specific data for connected users, such as tokens and scopes.
5. Managing provider access and tokens for connected users.

These operations allow the application to maintain a link between users in external systems (like Google or Fitbit) and the internal user system, facilitating data synchronization and authentication across different platforms.

## Key Files

### create-connected-user.ts
This file contains the `createConnectedUser` function, which generates a new unique ID using UUID and creates a new `ConnectedUser` record in the database. It associates the new user with a provided client application ID (`cxId`) and external user ID (`cxUserId`).

### delete-connected-user.ts
This file provides the `deleteConnectedUser` function, which removes a connected user record from the database based on the user's ID.

### get-connected-user.ts
This file contains multiple functions for retrieving connected user information:

- `getConnectedUser`: Retrieves a single connected user by ID and client application ID.
- `getConnectedUserOrFail`: Similar to `getConnectedUser`, but throws an error if the user is not found.
- `getAllConnectedUsers`: Retrieves all connected users, optionally filtered by client application ID.
- `getConnectedUsers`: Retrieves multiple connected users based on an array of IDs and a client application ID.
- `getConnectedUserByTokenOrFail`: Retrieves a connected user based on a partial token match for a specific provider.
- `getConnectedUsersByTokenOrFail`: Retrieves multiple connected users based on a partial token match for a specific provider.
- `getConnectedUsersByDeviceId`: Retrieves connected users based on a device ID for a specific provider.

### save-connected-user.ts
This file contains the `updateProviderData` function, which updates the provider-specific data (such as tokens and scopes) for a connected user. It merges new provider data with existing data and updates the database record.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following main dependencies:

1. Sequelize: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library used for database operations.
2. UUID: Used for generating unique identifiers for new connected user records.

## Configuration
The code doesn't directly use configuration files, but it does rely on the `ConnectedUser` model, which likely has its own configuration for database connection and schema definition.

The `ProviderOptions` enum is used in several places, suggesting that the system supports multiple external providers. This enum is likely defined in a shared constants file.

## Additional Notes

1. Error Handling: The code uses custom error types like `NotFoundError` for handling cases where connected users are not found in the database.

2. Partial String Matching: The functions `getConnectedUserByTokenOrFail` and `getConnectedUsersByTokenOrFail` use partial string matching for token retrieval. There's a TODO comment (TODO 749) indicating that this approach may be inefficient and should be improved.

3. Provider Map: Connected users have a `providerMap` field that stores provider-specific data. This allows the system to maintain different sets of credentials or information for each provider a user is connected to.

4. Device IDs: The system supports querying connected users by device IDs, suggesting that it may be used in a context where users can connect multiple devices (e.g., fitness trackers, smartphones) to their accounts.

5. Asynchronous Operations: All database operations are asynchronous, returning Promises to ensure non-blocking execution in a Node.js environment.

This directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the lifecycle and data of connected users, allowing the larger application to integrate with various external systems while maintaining a consistent internal user representation.
