## High-level description
The `createOrganization` function is responsible for creating a new organization within the Metriport system. This involves generating a unique organization ID, persisting the organization data to the database, and creating a corresponding tenant in the FHIR server.

## References
- `getOrganization` (from `./get-organization`): Used to check if an organization already exists for the given customer ID.
- `createOrganizationId` (from `../customer-sequence/create-id`): Used to generate a unique organization ID and number.
- `toFHIR` (from `../../../external/fhir/organization`): Used to convert the organization data to FHIR format.
- `upsertOrgToFHIRServer` (from `../../../external/fhir/organization/upsert-organization`): Used to create or update the organization on the FHIR server.
- `createTenantIfNotExists` (from `../../../external/fhir/admin`): Used to create a tenant on the FHIR server if one doesn't already exist for the organization.

## Symbols

### `createOrganization`
#### Description
Creates a new organization in the Metriport system, including database persistence and FHIR server tenant creation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The customer ID associated with the organization. |
| type | OrganizationBizType | The type of business the organization is (e.g., healthcare provider). |
| data | OrganizationData | The organization's data, including name, type, and location. |
| cqApproved | boolean | Flag indicating if the organization is approved for Carequality. |
| cqActive | boolean | Flag indicating if the organization is active in Carequality. |
| cwApproved | boolean | Flag indicating if the organization is approved for Commonwell. |
| cwActive | boolean | Flag indicating if the organization is active in Commonwell. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | OrganizationModel | The newly created organization model. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if an organization already exists for the given `cxId`. If so, throws a `BadRequestError`.
2. Calls `createOrganizationInternal` to handle the actual organization creation logic.
3. Calls `createTenantIfNotExists` to create a tenant on the FHIR server for the new organization.
4. Converts the organization data to FHIR format using `toFHIR`.
5. Calls `upsertOrgToFHIRServer` to create or update the organization on the FHIR server.
6. Returns the newly created organization model.

### `createOrganizationInternal`
#### Description
Handles the internal logic of creating an organization, including generating a unique ID and persisting the data to the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The customer ID associated with the organization. |
| type | OrganizationBizType | The type of business the organization is (e.g., healthcare provider). |
| data | OrganizationData | The organization's data, including name, type, and location. |
| cqApproved | boolean | Flag indicating if the organization is approved for Carequality. |
| cqActive | boolean | Flag indicating if the organization is active in Carequality. |
| cwApproved | boolean | Flag indicating if the organization is approved for Commonwell. |
| cwActive | boolean | Flag indicating if the organization is active in Commonwell. |
| attempt | number | The current attempt number for creating the organization (used for retry logic). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | OrganizationModel | The newly created organization model. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `createOrganizationId` to generate a unique `oid` and `organizationNumber`.
2. Attempts to create a new `OrganizationModel` instance with the generated ID and provided data.
3. If a `UniqueConstraintError` is thrown (indicating a collision in generating the organization ID), retries the creation process up to `MAX_ATTEMPTS` times with a short delay between attempts.
4. If all attempts fail, logs an error message and re-throws the error.
5. If the organization is created successfully, returns the newly created `OrganizationModel` instance.

## Error Handling
- Throws a `BadRequestError` if an organization already exists for the given customer ID.
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for handling `UniqueConstraintError` during organization ID generation.
- Logs an error message and re-throws any other errors encountered during the creation process.
