## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the medical organization-related functionality in the API. It includes tests for creating and registering organizations, covering various scenarios and edge cases.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory ensure that the process of creating and registering medical organizations works correctly. They verify that:

1. New organizations can be created with proper identifiers and details.
2. The system prevents duplicate organizations for the same customer.
3. The creation process interacts correctly with external services and databases.
4. Address information for organizations is properly handled, including geographical coordinates.

These tests help maintain the reliability and correctness of the organization management features in the medical API.

## Key Files

1. `create-organization.test.ts`:
   This file contains unit tests for the `createOrganization` function. It tests various scenarios such as:
   - Preventing creation of duplicate organizations for a customer
   - Correct generation and assignment of organization IDs and numbers
   - Proper creation and return of organization objects
   - Interaction with external services like FHIR servers and CommonWell/Carequality systems

2. `register-organization.ts`:
   This file defines test data for a medical organization's address with coordinates. It uses the Faker.js library to generate realistic-looking data for testing purposes. The file includes:
   - A `coordinates` constant with latitude and longitude
   - An `addressWithCoordinates` constant with a complete address including geographical coordinates

## Dependencies
1. @faker-js/faker: Used for generating realistic test data, particularly for addresses and coordinates.
2. @metriport/shared: Provides the USState enum used in address generation.
3. @metriport/core/domain/address: Supplies types like Coordinates and AddressWithCoordinates.

These dependencies are crucial for creating realistic and type-safe test data, ensuring that the tests accurately represent real-world scenarios.

## Configuration
The tests use various mocking strategies to isolate the tested functionality from external dependencies:

- `createOrganizationId` is mocked to return predefined organization IDs and numbers.
- External service calls like `createTenantIfNotExists`, `upsertOrgToFHIRServer`, and CommonWell/Carequality commands are mocked to prevent actual external calls during testing.
- `address.getAddressWithCoordinates` is mocked to provide consistent address data.

These mocks are set up in the `beforeAll` block and cleared before each test in the `beforeEach` block, ensuring a clean testing environment for each test case.

The use of Faker.js in `register-organization.ts` allows for the generation of varied but realistic address data, which can be consistently used across tests without hardcoding values.
