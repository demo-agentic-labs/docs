## References
- `OrganizationModel`: This symbol is referenced to fetch the maximum organization number.
- `makeOrganizationOID`: This function is used to generate the OID based on the organization number.

### `createOrganizationId`
#### Description
This asynchronous function generates a unique organization ID (OID) and an organization number for a new organization.

#### Inputs
This function has no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `{ oid, organizationNumber }` | `{ oid: string, organizationNumber: number }` | An object containing the generated OID (string) and organization number (number). |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the maximum existing organization number from the `OrganizationModel` using `OrganizationModel.max("organizationNumber")`.
2. Increments the retrieved maximum organization number by 1 to get a new unique organization number.
3. Generates the OID by calling the `makeOrganizationOID` function, passing in the new organization number.
4. Returns an object containing the generated OID and organization number.

## Side Effects
This function does not have any direct side effects. However, it interacts with the `OrganizationModel` to fetch data, which might have side effects depending on the implementation of the model.
