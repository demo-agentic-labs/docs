## High-level description
The `processPatientDocumentRequest` function is responsible for sending a webhook notification to the customer with the results of a document query. It handles both successful queries with document references and failed queries with an optional error message. This function is used for various document-related webhooks, including document downloads, conversions, and consolidated data.

## Code Structure
The code defines an enum `MAPIWebhookStatus` to represent the status of a webhook request. The main function `processPatientDocumentRequest` orchestrates the process of retrieving settings, patient data, constructing the payload, and sending the webhook request. It utilizes helper functions like `getMetadata` and `isWebhookDisabled` to determine the appropriate metadata and whether to send the webhook.

### `processPatientDocumentRequest`
#### Description
This function sends a webhook notification to the customer with the results of a document query. It handles both successful queries with document references and failed queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The customer's ID. |
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient the documents belong to. |
| whType | MAPIWebhookType | The type of webhook being sent. |
| status | MAPIWebhookStatus | The status of the document query (completed or failed). |
| requestId | string \| undefined | The ID of the request that triggered the document query. |
| documents | DocumentReferenceDTO[] \| DocumentBulkUrlDTO[] \| undefined | An optional array of document references or bulk download URLs. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the customer's settings and the patient's data.
2. Constructs the webhook payload, including patient information, document references (if any), and the status of the request.
3. Determines the appropriate metadata for the webhook based on the webhook type.
4. Checks if the webhook is disabled based on the metadata.
5. If the webhook is not disabled:
    - Creates a webhook request in the database.
    - Sends the webhook request to the customer's URL.
    - Updates the webhook request status in the database.
    - If the webhook type is `DOWNLOAD_WEBHOOK_TYPE` or `CONVERSION_WEBHOOK_TYPE`, updates the patient's document query progress to indicate that the webhook has been sent.
6. If the webhook is disabled:
    - Creates a webhook request in the database with a "success" status, even though the webhook was not actually sent.
7. Emits a `CanvasIntegrationEvent` through the `patientEvents` EventEmitter.
8. If the webhook type is `medical.document-download` and the status is `completed`, reports usage for document query.
9. Handles any errors during the process by logging them and capturing them in Sentry.

### `MAPIWebhookStatus`
#### Description
Enum representing the possible statuses of a MAPI webhook request.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
Defines two possible values:
- `completed`: Indicates that the webhook request was processed successfully.
- `failed`: Indicates that the webhook request failed.

## Side Effects
- Creates webhook requests in the database.
- Sends HTTP requests to the customer's webhook URL.
- Updates the customer's webhook status in the database.
- Updates the patient's document query progress in the database.
- Emits a `CanvasIntegrationEvent` through the `patientEvents` EventEmitter.
- Reports usage for document query.
- Logs messages and captures errors in Sentry.

## Error Handling
The function uses a try-catch block to handle any errors that occur during the process. Errors are logged using the `Util.log` function and captured in Sentry using the `capture.error` function.

## Logging
The function uses the `Util.log` function to log messages during the process.
