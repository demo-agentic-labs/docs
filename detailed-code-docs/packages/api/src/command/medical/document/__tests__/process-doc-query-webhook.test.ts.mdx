## High-level description
The `process-doc-query-webhook.test.ts` file contains unit tests for the `processDocQueryProgressWebhook` function, which is responsible for handling webhook events related to document query progress (download and conversion) and triggering further actions based on the progress status. 

The tests cover scenarios like processing, completed, and failed statuses for both download and conversion processes, ensuring the function behaves as expected in each case.

## Code Structure
The code defines a test suite using `describe` blocks for grouping related tests. Inside the `describe` blocks, `it` blocks define individual test cases. The tests utilize Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate the function's behavior and simulate different scenarios.

## References
- `documentWebhook.processPatientDocumentRequest`: This function is called when the document query progress is "completed" or "failed" to handle further processing and potentially send webhooks.
- `processDocQueryWebhook.composeDocRefPayload`: This function is called to compose the payload for the webhook request.

## Symbols

### `processDocQueryProgressWebhook`
#### Description
This function handles document query progress webhook events and triggers further actions based on the progress status. It checks the status of download and convert processes and calls `processPatientDocumentRequest` if the status is "completed" or "failed".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient object. |
| requestId | string | The ID of the request. |
| documentQueryProgress | \{ download?: \{ status: "processing" \| "completed" \| "failed", webhookSent?: boolean \}, convert?: \{ status: "processing" \| "completed" \| "failed", webhookSent?: boolean \} \} | The document query progress object containing download and convert progress. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the status of `download` and `convert` processes in the `documentQueryProgress` object.
2. If the status is "processing", no action is taken.
3. If the status is "completed" and `webhookSent` is not true, it calls `composeDocRefPayload` to get the webhook payload and then calls `processPatientDocumentRequest` to handle further processing.
4. If the status is "failed", it calls `composeDocRefPayload` (if applicable) and then calls `processPatientDocumentRequest` to handle further processing.
5. If the status is "completed" and `webhookSent` is true, no action is taken.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/core/util/uuid-v7`: Used for generating UUIDs.
- `@metriport/core/domain/patient`: Provides the `Patient` interface.
- `../../../../routes/medical/dtos/documentDTO`: Provides the `DocumentReferenceDTO` interface.
- Jest: Used for testing and mocking.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.

## Logging
The code does not implement logging.
