### `deleteFacility`
#### Description
This function attempts to delete a facility. It retrieves the facility, checks for associated patients, and if none are found, deletes the facility.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| { cxId, id } | `GetFacilitiesQuery` | An object containing the `cxId` and `id` of the facility to delete. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | `Promise&lt;void&gt;` | A promise that resolves when the facility is deleted. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves the facility:** Calls `getFacilityOrFail` to fetch the facility based on the provided `cxId` and `id`.
2. **Checks for associated patients:** Calls `getPatients` to retrieve a list of patients associated with the facility.
3. **Throws an error if patients exist:** If any patients are found, it throws a `BadRequestError` indicating that the facility cannot be deleted.
4. **Deletes the facility:** If no patients are associated, it calls the `destroy` method on the facility object to delete it.

#### Error Handling
- Throws a `NotFoundError` if the facility does not exist.
- Throws a `BadRequestError` if the facility has associated patients.

## Side Effects
- Deletes a facility from the database.
