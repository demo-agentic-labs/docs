## High-level description
The code defines two functions, `verifyCxProviderAccess` and `verifyCxItVendorAccess`, that check if an organization associated with a given `cxId` has the correct business type (healthcare provider or healthcare IT vendor) to perform certain actions, presumably related to medical facilities. 

These functions are used to enforce authorization rules, ensuring that only organizations with the appropriate permissions can create or update facilities.

## Code Structure
Both `verifyCxProviderAccess` and `verifyCxItVendorAccess` rely on the `getOrganizationOrFail` function to retrieve organization details based on the provided `cxId`. They then check the organization's `type` property to determine if it matches the required business type.

## References
- `getOrganizationOrFail`: A function that retrieves an organization by its `cxId` or throws an error if not found.
- `OrganizationBizType`: An enum defining the possible business types for an organization (healthcare provider or healthcare IT vendor).

### `verifyCxProviderAccess`
#### Description
This function checks if an organization associated with the given `cxId` is a healthcare provider. It throws an error if the organization is a healthcare IT vendor and `throwOnNoAccess` is true or not set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The `cxId` of the organization. |
| throwOnNoAccess | boolean | (Optional) If true, throws an error if the organization is not a healthcare provider. Defaults to true. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | boolean | True if the organization is a healthcare provider, false otherwise. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the organization using `getOrganizationOrFail`.
2. Checks if the organization type is `OrganizationBizType.healthcareITVendor`.
3. If the organization is a healthcare IT vendor and `throwOnNoAccess` is true or not set, throws a `ForbiddenError`.
4. Returns true if the organization is a healthcare provider, false otherwise.

### `verifyCxItVendorAccess`
#### Description
This function checks if an organization associated with the given `cxId` is a healthcare IT vendor. It throws an error if the organization is a healthcare provider and `throwOnNoAccess` is true or not set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The `cxId` of the organization. |
| throwOnNoAccess | boolean | (Optional) If true, throws an error if the organization is not a healthcare IT vendor. Defaults to true. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | boolean | True if the organization is a healthcare IT vendor, false otherwise. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the organization using `getOrganizationOrFail`.
2. Checks if the organization type is `OrganizationBizType.healthcareProvider`.
3. If the organization is a healthcare provider and `throwOnNoAccess` is true or not set, throws a `ForbiddenError`.
4. Returns true if the organization is a healthcare IT vendor, false otherwise.

## Error Handling
- Both functions throw a `ForbiddenError` if the organization does not have the required business type and `throwOnNoAccess` is true or not set.
- The `getOrganizationOrFail` function throws a `NotFoundError` if the organization is not found.
