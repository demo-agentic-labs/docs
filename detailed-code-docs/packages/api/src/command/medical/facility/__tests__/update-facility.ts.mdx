- `makeFacility`: This symbol is imported from another file and is used to generate part of the returned object.

## Symbols

### `makeFacilityUpdateCmd`
#### Description
This function creates and returns a `FacilityUpdateCmd` object populated with data. It leverages the `makeFacility` function to generate the base facility data and allows for overriding specific fields through optional parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Partial&lt;FacilityUpdateCmd&gt; | Optional parameters to customize the generated `FacilityUpdateCmd` object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | FacilityUpdateCmd | A `FacilityUpdateCmd` object populated with data, potentially customized by the input parameters. |

#### Internal Logic
1. It calls the `makeFacility` function, passing in the provided `params`. This generates a `Facility` object.
2. It constructs and returns a new `FacilityUpdateCmd` object. The generated `Facility` object from the previous step is spread into this new object, effectively copying its properties.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FacilityUpdateCmd | Defines the structure of the command object used for updating facility information. |
| makeFacility | Provides a way to generate a `Facility` object, which is used as the basis for the `FacilityUpdateCmd` object. |
