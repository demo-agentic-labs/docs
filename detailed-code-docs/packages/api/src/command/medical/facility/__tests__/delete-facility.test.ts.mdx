## High-level description
The `deleteFacility` function in `delete-facility.test.ts` provides a test suite for the `deleteFacility` function, which is responsible for deleting a facility from the system. The tests cover scenarios such as checking for facility existence, handling cases with associated patients, and successful deletion.

## Code Structure
The code defines a test suite using Jest, mocking dependencies like `FacilityModel` and functions like `getFacilityOrFail`. It sets up mocks in `beforeAll`, clears them after each test in `afterEach`, and restores them in `afterAll`. The `describe` block groups tests related to `deleteFacility`.

## Symbols
### `describe(deleteFacility, ...)`
#### Description
This block encapsulates the test suite for the `deleteFacility` function.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite includes the following test cases:

- **"checks if facility exists"**: Verifies that `getFacilityOrFail` is called with the correct facility identifier when `deleteFacility` is invoked.
- **"throws if facility does not exists"**: Asserts that a `NotFoundError` is thrown if `getFacilityOrFail` indicates the facility doesn't exist, and that `FacilityModel.destroy` is not called.
- **"throws if facility contains patients"**: Checks that a `BadRequestError` is thrown if there are patients associated with the facility, preventing deletion.
- **"deletes if facility does not contain patients"**: Confirms that `FacilityModel.destroy` is called to delete the facility when no patients are associated.

## Dependencies
- jest
- jest-mock
- @metriport/core/util/error/not-found
- @metriport/shared

## Error Handling
The tests specifically address error handling by asserting that `NotFoundError` is thrown when a facility is not found and `BadRequestError` is thrown when attempting to delete a facility with associated patients.
