## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of medical facility-related functionality for the API. It includes functions for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving facilities, as well as verifying access permissions for different types of organizations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory manages the lifecycle of medical facilities within the system. It provides the following key functionalities:

1. Creating new facilities: Validates input data, generates unique identifiers, and persists facility information to the database.
2. Updating existing facilities: Allows modification of facility details while ensuring data integrity and performing necessary validations.
3. Deleting facilities: Removes facilities from the system, but only if they have no associated patients.
4. Retrieving facility information: Provides various methods to fetch facility data based on different criteria such as ID, OID, or NPI.
5. Access control: Verifies whether an organization has the necessary permissions to perform actions on facilities based on their type (healthcare provider or healthcare IT vendor).

These functions work together to provide a comprehensive facility management system, ensuring data consistency, proper access control, and adherence to business rules specific to medical facilities.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this functionality are:

1. `create-facility.ts`: Contains the `createFacility` function for adding new facilities to the system.
2. `update-facility.ts`: Provides the `updateFacility` function for modifying existing facility records.
3. `delete-facility.ts`: Implements the `deleteFacility` function for removing facilities from the system.
4. `get-facility.ts`: Offers various functions for retrieving facility information, such as `getFacilities`, `getFacilityOrFail`, and `getFacilityByNpi`.
5. `verify-access.ts`: Implements access control checks with `verifyCxItVendorAccess` and `verifyCxProviderAccess` functions.

The data flow typically starts with access verification, followed by the creation, retrieval, update, or deletion of facility records. These operations interact with the `FacilityModel` to persist and retrieve data from the database.

## Key Files

1. `create-facility.ts`:
   - Implements the `createFacility` function for adding new facilities.
   - Includes validation logic for OBO (Organization Based Onboarding) data and NPI (National Provider Identifier).
   - Generates unique identifiers for new facilities.

2. `update-facility.ts`:
   - Contains the `updateFacility` function for modifying existing facility records.
   - Performs validation checks before updating the database, including version control and OBO validation.

3. `delete-facility.ts`:
   - Implements the `deleteFacility` function for removing facilities.
   - Checks for associated patients before allowing deletion.

4. `get-facility.ts`:
   - Provides various functions for retrieving facility data, including `getFacilities`, `getFacilityOrFail`, `getFaciltiyByOidOrFail`, and `getFacilityByNpi`.
   - Handles different query parameters and error scenarios.

5. `verify-access.ts`:
   - Implements access control checks with `verifyCxItVendorAccess` and `verifyCxProviderAccess` functions.
   - Determines if an organization has the necessary permissions based on its type.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @metriport/core: Provides domain-specific types, errors, and utilities.
2. @metriport/shared: Offers shared utilities and error types.
3. Sequelize: Used indirectly through the `FacilityModel` for database interactions.

Internal dependencies include:
- Various models (e.g., `FacilityModel`, `PatientModel`)
- Domain objects and types related to facilities and organizations
- Utility functions for error handling and data validation

## Configuration
While there are no specific configuration files in this directory, the code uses several environment-specific settings and constants:

1. Facility types (e.g., `FacilityType.initiatorAndResponder`)
2. Organization business types (e.g., `OrganizationBizType.healthcareProvider`)
3. Default values for Carequality and Commonwell settings (e.g., `cqApproved`, `cwActive`)

These configurations are likely defined in separate configuration files or environment variables for the entire project.

Here's an example of how these components work together:

```typescript
// Creating a new facility
const newFacility = await createFacility({
  cxId: "customer123",
  data: {
    name: "Example Hospital",
    npi: "1234567890",
    // ... other facility data
  },
  cqApproved: true,
  cwApproved: false,
});

// Updating an existing facility
const updatedFacility = await updateFacility({
  id: newFacility.id,
  cxId: "customer123",
  eTag: newFacility.eTag,
  data: {
    name: "Updated Hospital Name",
  },
});

// Retrieving facility information
const facility = await getFacilityOrFail("customer123", newFacility.id);

// Deleting a facility
await deleteFacility({ cxId: "customer123", id: newFacility.id });

// Verifying access for a healthcare provider
const hasAccess = await verifyCxProviderAccess("customer123");
```

This code demonstrates the typical flow of creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting a facility, along with access verification. Each operation includes necessary validations and error handling to ensure data integrity and proper access control.
