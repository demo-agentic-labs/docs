## High-level description
The `createFacility` function is responsible for creating a new facility in the system. It takes in facility details, validates the input, and persists the facility data to the database. It also handles the creation of unique identifiers for the facility.

## References
- `FacilityModel`: Used to interact with the facility data in the database.
- `getFacilityByNpi`: Used to check for existing facilities with the same NPI.
- `validateObo`: Used to validate OBO (Organized Beforehand) related data for the facility.
- `uuidv7`: Used to generate a unique ID for the facility.

### `createFacility`
#### Description
Creates a new facility with the provided data and persists it to the database. It generates a unique ID, validates the input, and sets default values for certain fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer the facility belongs to. |
| data | `FacilityData` | The facility data to be stored. |
| cqApproved | boolean | Flag indicating if the facility is approved for Carequality. Defaults to `false`. |
| cqActive | boolean | Flag indicating if the facility is active in Carequality. Defaults to `false`. |
| cqType | `FacilityType` | The type of facility in Carequality. Defaults to `FacilityType.initiatorAndResponder`. |
| cqOboOid | string \| null | The Carequality OBO OID. Defaults to `null`. |
| cwApproved | boolean | Flag indicating if the facility is approved for Commonwell. Defaults to `false`. |
| cwActive | boolean | Flag indicating if the facility is active in Commonwell. Defaults to `false`. |
| cwType | `FacilityType` | The type of facility in Commonwell. Defaults to `FacilityType.initiatorAndResponder`. |
| cwOboOid | string \| null | The Commonwell OBO OID. Defaults to `null`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| facility | `Promise&lt;FacilityModel&gt;` | A promise that resolves to the created facility model. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a new UUID for the facility ID.
2. Sets default values for `oid` and `facilityNumber`. These will be updated later in the process.
3. Validates the OBO-related data using the `validateObo` function.
4. Validates the NPI (National Provider Identifier) using the `validateNPI` function.
5. Creates a new facility record in the database using the `FacilityModel.create` method.

### `validateNPI`
#### Description
Validates the NPI (National Provider Identifier) of the facility. It ensures that the NPI is not being updated to a different value and that no other facility with the same NPI exists for the given customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |
| newNpi | string | The new NPI to be validated. |
| existingNpi | string | The existing NPI of the facility (optional). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;void&gt;` | A promise that resolves if the validation is successful, otherwise throws an error. |

#### Internal Logic
1. If `existingNpi` is provided and it's different from `newNpi`, throws a `BadRequestError` indicating that the NPI cannot be updated.
2. If `existingNpi` is not provided (meaning it's a new facility), it searches for an existing facility with the same NPI using `getFacilityByNpi`.
3. If a facility with the same NPI is found, throws a `BadRequestError` indicating that a facility with the same NPI already exists.

### `validateObo`
#### Description
Validates the OBO (Organized Beforehand) related data for the facility. It ensures that if the facility is an OBO facility, the corresponding OBO OID is provided.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| facility | `FacilityCreate` | The facility data to be validated. |
| throwOnError | boolean | Flag indicating whether to throw an error if validation fails. Defaults to `true`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | boolean | Returns `true` if the validation is successful. If `throwOnError` is `true`, throws a `BadRequestError` if validation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the facility is a CW (Commonwell) OBO facility and if the `cwOboOid` is provided. If not, throws a `BadRequestError` or returns `false` based on the `throwOnError` flag.
2. Checks if the facility is a CQ (Carequality) OBO facility and if the `cqOboOid` is provided. If not, throws a `BadRequestError` or returns `false` based on the `throwOnError` flag.
3. If all checks pass, returns `true`.

## Error Handling
- Throws `BadRequestError` if the input data is invalid, such as attempting to update the NPI or if required OBO data is missing.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/core/util/error/bad-request`: Used for throwing `BadRequestError`.
- `@metriport/core/util/uuid-v7`: Used for generating UUIDs.
- `../../../domain/medical/facility`: Provides types and enums related to facilities.
- `../../../models/medical/facility`: Provides the `FacilityModel` for database interactions.
- `./get-facility`: Provides the `getFacilityByNpi` function.
