## High-level description
The `populateFhirServer` function is a deprecated function that was used to populate a FHIR server with patient and organization data from the database. It is no longer in use and does not support multiple HIEs.

### `populateFhirServer`
#### Description
This function is deprecated and should no longer be used. It retrieves organization and patient data from the database and attempts to create or update corresponding resources on a FHIR server. It also has an option to trigger document queries for each patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |
| createIfNotExists | boolean | Whether to create the tenant on the FHIR server if it does not exist (default: false). |
| triggerDocQuery | boolean | Whether to trigger a new document query for each patient (default: false). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `{ patientsOK, patientsError }` | `PopulateFhirServerResponse` | An object containing the number of patients successfully created/updated (`patientsOK`) and the number of patients that failed to be created/updated (`patientsError`). |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the tenant exists on the FHIR server. If not, it either throws an error or creates the tenant based on the `createIfNotExists` flag.
2. Retrieves organization data from the database and creates/updates the corresponding organization resource on the FHIR server.
3. Retrieves patient data from the database and iterates over them in chunks.
4. For each patient chunk:
    - Adds a random jitter delay to avoid overloading the FHIR server.
    - Creates/updates the corresponding patient resource on the FHIR server.
    - Optionally triggers a document query for the patient based on the `triggerDocQuery` flag.
    - Adds a delay between chunks.
5. Returns the number of successful and failed patient creations/updates.

#### Side Effects
- Creates/updates organization and patient resources on the FHIR server.
- May trigger document queries for patients.

#### Performance Considerations
- The function uses chunking and random delays to avoid overloading the FHIR server.
- Document queries are triggered asynchronously to improve performance.

## Error Handling
- Throws a `BadRequestError` if the tenant does not exist and `createIfNotExists` is false, or if both `cxId` and `allCustomers` are provided.
- Logs errors encountered during patient creation/update and document query triggering.

## Logging
- Logs key steps and errors encountered during the process.

## TODOs
- This function is deprecated and should be replaced with a solution that supports multiple HIEs.
