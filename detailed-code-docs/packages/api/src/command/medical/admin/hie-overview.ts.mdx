## High-level description
The `getHieOverview` function retrieves a comprehensive overview of a patient's data across different health information exchanges (HIEs). It gathers information from Carequality and Commonwell, including patient demographics, links to external gateways, and any errors encountered during data retrieval.

## Code Structure
The code defines several types and functions to represent HIE gateways, patient data from different sources, and the overall HIE overview. The main function, `getHieOverview`, orchestrates the retrieval of data from Carequality and Commonwell and combines them into a single object.

## References
- `PatientModel`: Model representing a patient in the database.
- `CQPatientDataModel`: Model representing Carequality patient data in the database.
- `cwCommands`: Module containing functions for interacting with Commonwell.

### `getHieOverview`
#### Description
Retrieves a comprehensive overview of a patient's data across different HIEs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient. |
| facilityIdParam | string \| undefined | Optional. The ID of the facility. |
| debugLevel | DebugLevel | The level of debugging information to include. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hieOverview | Promise&lt;HiePatientOverview \| undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to the HIE overview object, or undefined if not found. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the patient and their Carequality data from the database.
2. Fetches data from Carequality and Commonwell concurrently.
3. Processes the Carequality data, extracting successful responses and consolidating errors.
4. Constructs the HIE overview object, combining data from all sources.

### `getCqData`
#### Description
Retrieves and processes Carequality data for a patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient object. |
| debugLevel | DebugLevel | The level of debugging information to include. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;\{ success: CqPdSuccessResponse[]; errors: CqPdErrorConsolidated[]; \}&gt; | A promise that resolves to an object containing successful Carequality responses and consolidated errors. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves Carequality data from the database.
2. Partitions the data into successful and erroneous responses.
3. Consolidates errors by grouping similar error messages and associated gateways.
4. Processes successful responses, extracting patient and gateway information.

### `getCwData`
#### Description
Retrieves Commonwell data for a patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient object. |
| facilityIdParam | string \| undefined | Optional. The ID of the facility. |
| debugLevel | DebugLevel | The level of debugging information to include. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cwLinks | Promise&lt;CwLinks \| undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to the Commonwell links object, or undefined if not found. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves Commonwell person links for the patient.
2. Converts the Commonwell links to the desired DTO format.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/core`: Core library providing domain models and utility functions.
- `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk`: SDK for interacting with IHE gateways.
- `@metriport/shared`: Shared library providing common utilities.
- `dayjs`: Date and time manipulation library.
- `jaro-winkler`: String similarity library.
- `lodash`: Utility library.
- `sequelize`: ORM for interacting with the database.

## Error Handling
The code uses the `NotFoundError` exception to indicate when a patient is not found. Errors encountered during Carequality data retrieval are consolidated and included in the HIE overview object.

## Logging
The `debugLevel` parameter controls the level of debugging information included in the response.
