## High-level description
The `api.ts` file defines a function `checkApiQuota` that checks the API Gateway usage quota for each API key associated with a customer. It sends a notification if the remaining quota is below a defined threshold. This helps in proactively monitoring and managing API usage to prevent service disruptions.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `checkApiQuota` and `getUsage`. `checkApiQuota` orchestrates the process of fetching usage data, filtering keys with low quota, retrieving organization information, and sending notifications. `getUsage` interacts with the AWS API Gateway to retrieve and process usage data for each API key.

## References
- `Config`: Used to retrieve configuration values like AWS region and API Gateway usage plan ID.
- `capture`: Used for sending notifications and logging messages.
- `getOrganizationOrFail`: Used to retrieve organization details based on cxId.
- `MetriportError`: Custom error class used for throwing errors with specific details.

## Symbols

### `checkApiQuota`
#### Description
This function retrieves API Gateway usage data, identifies API keys with low remaining quota, and sends notifications with details of customers who are approaching their limits.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `Promise&lt;CustomersWithLowQuota[]&gt;` | `Promise&lt;CustomersWithLowQuota[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `CustomersWithLowQuota` objects, each representing a customer with low remaining API quota. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves API Gateway usage data using `getUsage`.
2. Filters the usage data to identify keys with remaining quota below the defined threshold (`MIN_QUOTA_TO_NOTIFY`).
3. Retrieves organization details for each identified key using `getOrgs`.
4. Constructs `CustomersWithLowQuota` objects containing usage details and organization name.
5. Logs a message and sends a notification with details of customers with low quota using `capture.message`.
6. Returns the array of `CustomersWithLowQuota` objects.

### `getUsage`
#### Description
This function retrieves API Gateway usage data for all API keys associated with the configured usage plan.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `Promise&lt;Usage[]&gt;` | `Promise&lt;Usage[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `Usage` objects, each representing the usage data for an API key. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the API Gateway usage plan ID from `Config`.
2. Fetches usage data for the current day from AWS API Gateway using `apiGw.getUsage`.
3. Processes the usage data for each API key:
    - Retrieves API key details using `apiGw.getApiKey`.
    - Extracts quota used, remaining, and total values.
    - Extracts the `cxId` from the API key name.
    - Constructs a `Usage` object with the extracted data.
4. Handles any errors during the process, logs them, and reports them using `capture.message`.
5. Returns the array of `Usage` objects.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error` | Provides a custom error class `MetriportError` for throwing errors with specific details. |
| `@metriport/shared/common/date` | Provides a constant `ISO_DATE` for formatting dates. |
| `aws-sdk` | Used to interact with AWS API Gateway. |
| `dayjs` | Used for date manipulation and formatting. |
| `lodash` | Used for array manipulation (uniq function). |
| `@metriport/core/domain/organization` | Provides the `Organization` interface. |
| `../../../shared/config` | Provides access to configuration values. |
| `../../../shared/log` | Provides utility functions for logging. |
| `../../../shared/notifications` | Provides functions for sending notifications. |
| `../organization/get-organization` | Provides the `getOrganizationOrFail` function for retrieving organization details. |

## Error Handling
The code uses the custom `MetriportError` class to throw errors with specific messages and additional information. Errors encountered during API Gateway interactions and organization retrieval are logged and reported using `capture.error` and `capture.message`.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` for logging informational messages and `capture.message` for logging messages and sending notifications.
