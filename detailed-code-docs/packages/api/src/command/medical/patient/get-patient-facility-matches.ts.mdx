## High-level description
The code defines a function `getPatientFacilityMatches` that retrieves and aggregates facility matches for a given patient from both Carequality (CQ) and Commonwell (CW) data sources. It processes patient data links, retrieves facility details, and normalizes patient demographics to return a list of matched facilities with their associated information.

## Code Structure
The code defines a main function `getPatientFacilityMatches` that orchestrates the retrieval of facility matches. It calls two helper functions, `getCqFacilityMatches` and `getCwFacilityMatches`, to handle data retrieval and processing for Carequality and Commonwell respectively. These helper functions utilize external data models and utility functions to fetch and normalize data.

## References
- `CQPatientDataModel`: Data model for accessing Carequality patient data.
- `CwPatientDataModel`: Data model for accessing Commonwell patient data.
- `CQDirectoryEntryModel`: Data model for accessing Carequality directory entries.
- `orgDirectory`: Directory of organizations from Commonwell.
- `cqPatientResourceToNormalizedLinkDemographics`: Utility function to normalize patient demographics from Carequality patient resources.
- `cwPatientResourceToNormalizedLinkDemographics`: Utility function to normalize patient demographics from Commonwell patient network links.

## Symbols

### `getPatientFacilityMatches`
#### Description
This function retrieves and aggregates facility matches for a given patient from both Carequality (CQ) and Commonwell (CW) data sources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | `string` | The ID of the patient. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;PatientFacilityMatch[]&gt; | `Promise&lt;PatientFacilityMatch[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `PatientFacilityMatch` objects, each representing a matched facility. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves patient data from CQ and CW data sources concurrently using `Promise.all`.
2. Extracts patient data links from the retrieved data.
3. Calls `getCqFacilityMatches` and `getCwFacilityMatches` concurrently to retrieve facility matches from CQ and CW respectively.
4. Combines the results from both sources and returns the aggregated list of facility matches.

### `getCqFacilityMatches`
#### Description
This function retrieves facility matches for a given patient from Carequality data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cqLinks | `CQLink[]` | An array of `CQLink` objects representing patient data links from Carequality. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;PatientFacilityMatch[]&gt; | `Promise&lt;PatientFacilityMatch[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `PatientFacilityMatch` objects, each representing a matched facility from Carequality. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each `CQLink` in the input array.
2. For each link, retrieves the corresponding facility details from `CQDirectoryEntryModel` using the link's `oid`.
3. If a facility is found, normalizes the patient demographics from the link's `patientResource` using `cqPatientResourceToNormalizedLinkDemographics`.
4. Constructs a `PatientFacilityMatch` object with the facility details and normalized patient demographics.
5. Returns the array of `PatientFacilityMatch` objects.

### `getCwFacilityMatches`
#### Description
This function retrieves facility matches for a given patient from Commonwell data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cwLinks | `CwLink[]` | An array of `CwLink` objects representing patient data links from Commonwell. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;PatientFacilityMatch[]&gt; | `Promise&lt;PatientFacilityMatch[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `PatientFacilityMatch` objects, each representing a matched facility from Commonwell. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `reduce` to iterate through each `CwLink` in the input array and accumulate facility matches.
2. For each link, extracts patient and provider information.
3. Retrieves the organization details from `orgDirectory` using the provider's `oid`.
4. Normalizes the patient demographics from the link's `patient` object using `cwPatientResourceToNormalizedLinkDemographics`.
5. Constructs a `PatientFacilityMatch` object with the organization details and normalized patient demographics.
6. Returns the array of `PatientFacilityMatch` objects.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Any errors encountered during data retrieval or processing will propagate up the call stack.
