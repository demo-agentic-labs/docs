## High-level description
The `consolidated-create.test.ts` file contains unit tests for the `createOrUpdateConsolidatedPatientData` function, which is responsible for converting a collection bundle of FHIR resources into a transaction bundle, uploading it to S3, and sending it to a FHIR server. 

The tests ensure that the function correctly handles existing and non-existing patient resources, appends the necessary PUT transactions, and removes unwanted FHIR data before returning the response.

## References
- `@metriport/core/domain/document/upload`: Uses the `createUploadFilePath` function to generate the S3 key for the FHIR bundle.
- `@metriport/core/external/fhir/api/api-hapi`: Utilizes the `HapiFhirClient` to interact with the FHIR server.
- `@metriport/core/fhir-to-cda/upload`: Employs the `uploadFhirBundleToS3` function to upload the FHIR bundle to S3.
- `@medplum/fhirtypes`: Uses various FHIR types like `Bundle`, `BundleEntry`, `DiagnosticReport`, and `Patient`.

## Symbols

### `describe('createConsolidateData', ...)`
#### Description
This block defines a test suite named "createConsolidateData" using Jest. It focuses on testing the `createOrUpdateConsolidatedPatientData` function.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite includes setup and teardown procedures using `beforeAll` and `afterAll` to mock dependencies and restore them after the tests. 

The main test case, `it('appends PUT transaction and patient when resource does exist and converting fhir bundle', ...)` asserts the following:
- The function correctly appends a PUT transaction to the transaction bundle for the provided DiagnosticReport resource.
- The function includes the patient resource in the contained section of the DiagnosticReport.
- The function calls the `executeBatch` method of the FHIR client with the correctly constructed transaction bundle.
- The function calls the `uploadFhirBundleToS3` function with the correct bundle and destination key.

The test case simulates a scenario where a patient resource already exists, and a new DiagnosticReport needs to be added to the patient's record. It verifies that the function correctly updates the FHIR server with the new information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used for generating fake data for testing purposes. |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides FHIR data types and interfaces. |
| @metriport/core/domain/document/upload | Used for generating file paths for uploads. |
| @metriport/core/external/fhir/api/api-hapi | Provides a FHIR client for interacting with a FHIR server. |
| @metriport/core/fhir-to-cda/upload | Provides functionality to upload FHIR bundles to S3. |
| @metriport/shared | Provides shared utilities, including error handling. |
| uuid | Used for generating unique identifiers. |

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling using a `try...catch` block to capture and log any errors encountered during the execution of the `createOrUpdateConsolidatedPatientData` function. 
- If the error message includes "ID", it throws a `MetriportError` with the original error message and additional context information.
- For other errors, it throws a generic `MetriportError` with the message "Error converting and storing fhir bundle resources" and additional context information.

## Logging
The code utilizes the `out` function from `@metriport/core/util/log` to log messages during the execution of the `createOrUpdateConsolidatedPatientData` function. 
- It logs the function name and parameters at the beginning of the function.
- It logs any errors encountered during the execution, including the error message and additional context information.
- It logs a success message after successfully uploading the FHIR bundle to S3.
