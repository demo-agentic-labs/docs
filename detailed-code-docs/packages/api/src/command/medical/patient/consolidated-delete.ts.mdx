## High-level description
The `deleteConsolidated` function in `consolidated-delete.ts` provides functionality to delete a patient's consolidated medical data from the FHIR server. It supports filtering by resource types and document IDs, and can operate in a dry-run mode for safety.

## Code Structure
The code defines a main function `deleteConsolidated` that orchestrates the deletion process. It relies on two helper functions: `getResourcesToDelete` to fetch the resources targeted for deletion based on provided filters, and `deleteResources` to perform the actual deletion in batches.

## References
- `@medplum/core`: Used for FHIR types and error handling.
- `@metriport/api-sdk`: Provides types and schemas related to consolidated data requests.
- `@metriport/core`: Offers utilities for logging, notifications, and FHIR API interactions.
- `@metriport/shared`: Contains shared utilities and constants.
- `./consolidated-get`: Imports `getConsolidatedPatientData` to retrieve the resources to be deleted.

## Symbols

### `deleteConsolidated`
#### Description
This function orchestrates the deletion of a patient's consolidated medical data from the FHIR server. It retrieves the resources to delete, filters out DocumentReference and Patient resources, and then performs the deletion in batches.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | `DeleteConsolidatedParams` | An object containing the parameters for the deletion operation. |

#### Inputs of `DeleteConsolidatedParams`
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | `Pick&lt;Patient, "id" \| "cxId" \| "data"&gt;` | An object containing the patient's ID, CX ID, and data. |
| dryRun | `boolean` | A flag indicating whether to perform a dry run (default: `false`). |
| resources | `ResourceTypeForConsolidation[]` | An optional array of resource types to filter by. |
| docIds | `string[]` | An array of document IDs to filter by. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the resources to delete using `getResourcesToDelete`.
2. Filters out DocumentReference and Patient resources from the list.
3. Deletes the remaining resources in batches using `deleteResources`.

### `getResourcesToDelete`
#### Description
This function retrieves the resources to delete from the FHIR server based on the provided filters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | `Pick&lt;Patient, "id" \| "cxId"&gt;` | An object containing the patient's ID and CX ID. |
| documentIds | `string[]` | An array of document IDs to filter by. |
| resources | `ResourceTypeForConsolidation[] \| undefined` | An optional array of resource types to filter by. |
| log | `typeof console.log` | A logging function. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resourcesToDelete | `Promise&lt;BundleEntry&lt;Resource&gt;[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of bundle entries representing the resources to delete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the consolidated patient data using `getConsolidatedPatientData`.
2. Filters the resources based on the provided `documentIds` and `resources` filters.
3. Excludes DocumentReference and Patient resources from the list.

### `deleteResources`
#### Description
This function deletes the specified resources from the FHIR server in batches.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resourcesToDelete | `BundleEntry&lt;Resource&gt;[]` | An array of bundle entries representing the resources to delete. |
| patient | `Pick&lt;Patient, "id" \| "cxId"&gt;` | An object containing the patient's ID and CX ID. |
| fhir | `FhirClient` | A FHIR client instance. |
| dryRun | `boolean` | A flag indicating whether to perform a dry run. |
| log | `typeof console.log` | A logging function. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an array of FHIR bundle entries for the resources to delete.
2. If `dryRun` is true, logs a message indicating the number of resources that would be deleted and returns.
3. Splits the bundle entries into chunks of `MAX_ITEMS_PER_BATCH`.
4. Iterates over the chunks and calls `deleteChunk` to delete each chunk.

### `deleteChunk`
#### Description
This function deletes a chunk of resources from the FHIR server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| entries | `BundleEntry&lt;Resource&gt;[]` | An array of bundle entries representing the resources to delete. |
| patientId | `string` | The patient's ID. |
| fhir | `FhirClient` | A FHIR client instance. |
| log | `typeof console.log` | A logging function. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a batch request to the FHIR server to delete the resources.
2. Logs any issues encountered during the deletion process.
3. Captures any errors using the `capture` utility.

## Side Effects
- This code modifies the FHIR server by deleting patient data.
- It logs messages to the console and captures errors using a notification system.

## Error Handling
- The code uses a try-catch block to handle errors during the deletion process.
- Errors are logged to the console and captured using the `capture` utility.
- Graceful handling of failures to delete individual resources is implemented by checking for specific success codes in the FHIR response.

## Logging
- The code uses a `log` function for logging messages to the console.
- It logs the progress of the deletion process, including the number of resources deleted and any encountered issues.

## Dependencies
- `@medplum/core`
- `@metriport/api-sdk`
- `@metriport/core`
- `@metriport/shared`
- `dayjs`
- `lodash`

## TODOs
- The code currently excludes DocumentReference and Patient resources from deletion. This logic should be made more dynamic and configurable.
