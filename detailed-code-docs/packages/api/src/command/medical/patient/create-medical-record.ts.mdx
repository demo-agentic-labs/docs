## High-level description
The `create-medical-record.ts` file provides functionality to manage and retrieve medical record summaries for patients. It handles retrieving the status of a medical record summary (whether it exists in HTML and/or PDF format) and fetching the signed URL for downloading the summary. The code also includes logic specific to handling medical record summaries in a sandbox environment.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main exported functions: `getMedicalRecordSummaryStatus` and `getMedicalRecordSummary`. 

- `getMedicalRecordSummaryStatus` retrieves the creation timestamps of HTML and PDF versions of a medical record summary.
- `getMedicalRecordSummary` fetches the signed URL for downloading a medical record summary in the specified format (HTML or PDF).

Both functions utilize helper functions like `createMRSummaryFileName`, `getSandboxFileNames`, and `getSandboxPatientName` to construct file names and paths, particularly within the context of a sandbox environment.

## Symbols

### `getMedicalRecordSummaryStatus`
#### Description
This function checks for the existence of a patient's medical record summary in both HTML and PDF formats on S3 and returns their creation timestamps if they exist. It handles both production and sandbox environments, adjusting the S3 bucket and file names accordingly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient. |
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;MedicalRecordsStatus&gt; | Promise&lt;\{ htmlCreatedAt?: string; pdfCreatedAt?: string \}&gt; | A promise that resolves to an object containing the creation timestamps of the HTML and PDF versions of the medical record summary, if they exist. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the S3 file keys for both HTML and PDF versions of the medical record summary.
2. Determines if the application is running in a sandbox environment.
3. If in the sandbox environment, retrieves the sandbox-specific file names and bucket name.
4. Uses the `s3Utils.getFileInfoFromS3` function to retrieve information about the HTML and PDF files from S3.
5. Extracts the creation timestamps from the S3 file information and returns them in an object.

### `getMedicalRecordSummary`
#### Description
This function retrieves the signed URL for downloading a patient's medical record summary in the specified format (HTML or PDF). It handles both production and sandbox environments, adjusting the S3 bucket and file names accordingly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient. |
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |
| conversionType | "pdf" \| "html" | The desired format of the medical record summary. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;string \| undefined&gt; | Promise\&lt;string \| undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to the signed URL of the medical record summary if it exists, otherwise undefined. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the creation timestamps of the HTML and PDF versions of the medical record summary using `getMedicalRecordSummaryStatus`.
2. Determines if the requested conversion type and its corresponding creation timestamp are valid.
3. Determines the appropriate S3 bucket name based on the environment (sandbox or production).
4. If in the sandbox environment and a valid conversion type is requested:
    - Retrieves the sandbox-specific patient name and file key.
    - Generates a signed URL using the sandbox bucket name and file key.
5. If a valid conversion type is requested (regardless of environment):
    - Constructs the S3 file key.
    - Generates a signed URL using the appropriate bucket name and file key.
6. Returns the signed URL if found, otherwise undefined.

### `getCreatedAtDate`
#### Description
This is a helper function that extracts the creation date from S3 file information. If the creation date is not available but the file exists, it defaults to a predefined date (`DEFAULT_MR_CREATION_DATE_STRING`).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| info | \{ exists: boolean; createdAt?: Date \} | An object containing information about an S3 file, including its existence and creation date. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string \| undefined | string \| undefined | The creation date as a string if available, otherwise undefined. |

### `getSandboxFileNames`
#### Description
This is a helper function specific to the sandbox environment. It constructs the S3 file keys for the HTML and PDF versions of the medical record summary using the sandbox-specific patient name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient. |
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;\{ s3HtmlSandboxKey: string; s3PdfSandboxKey: string \}&gt; | Promise\&lt;\{ s3HtmlSandboxKey: string; s3PdfSandboxKey: string \}&gt; | A promise that resolves to an object containing the sandbox-specific S3 file keys for the HTML and PDF versions of the medical record summary. |

### `getSandboxPatientName`
#### Description
This is a helper function specific to the sandbox environment. It retrieves the first name of the patient from the database. If the patient is not found, it defaults to "jane".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient. |
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;string&gt; | Promise\&lt;string&gt; | A promise that resolves to the first name of the patient or "jane" if the patient is not found. |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/medical-record-summary | Provides utilities for working with medical record summary file names. |
| @metriport/core/external/aws/s3 | Provides utilities for interacting with AWS S3. |
| ../../../shared/config | Provides access to application configuration settings. |
| ../document/document-download | Provides the `getSignedURL` function for generating signed URLs for S3 objects. |
| ./get-patient | Provides the `getPatient` function for retrieving patient information. |
| ./shared | Provides helper functions for sanitizing and validating patient data, as well as constructing sandbox-specific file names. |

## Configuration
The code relies on the following configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `AWS_REGION` | string | N/A | The AWS region where the S3 bucket is located. |
| `MEDICAL_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET_NAME` | string | N/A | The name of the S3 bucket where medical documents are stored. |
| `SANDBOX_SEED_BUCKET_NAME` | string | N/A | The name of the S3 bucket used for seeding data in the sandbox environment. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Any errors encountered during S3 interactions or other operations will be propagated to the caller.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.
