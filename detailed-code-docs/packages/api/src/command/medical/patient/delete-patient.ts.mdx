## High-level description
The `deletePatient` function in `delete-patient.ts` is responsible for deleting a patient from the system. This includes removing the patient from external systems (like Commonwell and Carequality), deleting the patient's FHIR resources, and finally, deleting the patient record from the database.

## Code Structure
The `deletePatient` function orchestrates the deletion process. It first retrieves the patient record and validates its version. Then, it performs the following actions concurrently:
- Removes the patient from Commonwell.
- Deletes the patient's FHIR resources.
- Removes the patient from Carequality.
Finally, it deletes the patient record from the database.

## Symbols
### `deletePatient`
#### Description
Deletes a patient from the system, including external systems and the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientDelete | `PatientDeleteCmd` | An object containing the patient's ID, customer ID, optional facility ID, and optional eTag for optimistic locking. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;void&gt;` | A promise that resolves when the patient has been deleted. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the patient record using `getPatientOrFail`.
2. Validates the patient's version using `validateVersionForUpdate` to prevent concurrent modifications.
3. Concurrently performs the following actions:
    - Removes the patient from Commonwell using `cwCommands.patient.remove`. If the patient is not found in Commonwell, logs a message and continues.
    - Deletes the patient's FHIR resources using `fhirApi.deleteResource`.
    - Removes the patient from Carequality using `cqCommands.patient.remove`.
4. Deletes the patient record from the database using `patient.destroy`.
5. If any errors occur during the process, captures the error using `capture.error` and re-throws it.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the database by deleting the patient record.
- Makes API calls to external systems (Commonwell, Carequality, FHIR server) to remove the patient's data.

## Error Handling
- Uses `processAsyncError` to handle errors during asynchronous operations.
- Captures and re-throws errors to propagate them to the caller.
- Logs errors using `capture.error` for debugging and monitoring.

## Logging
- Logs a message if the patient is not found in Commonwell during deletion.
- Logs errors using `capture.error`.
