## High-level description
The code defines the function `getCoverageAssessments`, which retrieves and calculates coverage assessment data for a list of patients. This assessment includes information about document download and conversion status, FHIR resource counts, and a pre-signed URL for downloading a medical record summary.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `getCoverageAssessments` and `getCoverageAssessment`. `getCoverageAssessments` iterates through a list of patients and calls `getCoverageAssessment` for each patient to retrieve their individual assessment data. `getCoverageAssessment` retrieves data from the patient model, generates a pre-signed URL for the medical record summary, and combines this information into a `CoverageAssessment` object.

## Symbols

### `getCoverageAssessments`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves coverage assessment data for a list of patients. It iterates through the patients, retrieves individual assessment data using `getCoverageAssessment`, and returns an array of `PatientWithCoverageAssessment` objects containing both patient and assessment information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |
| patients | PatientModel[] | An array of `PatientModel` objects representing the patients to retrieve coverage assessments for. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;PatientWithCoverageAssessment[]&gt; | Promise&lt;PatientWithCoverageAssessment[]&gt; | A promise that resolves to an array of `PatientWithCoverageAssessment` objects, each containing patient data and their corresponding coverage assessment. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an empty array `patientsWithAssessment` to store the results.
2. Initializes an empty array `wrapperErrors` to store errors encountered during individual patient assessment retrieval.
3. Defines an asynchronous wrapper function `getCoverageAssessmentWrapper` that handles individual patient assessment retrieval and error handling.
4. Uses `executeAsynchronously` to retrieve coverage assessments for each patient concurrently, with a maximum of 20 parallel executions.
5. If any errors occurred during individual patient assessment retrieval, captures an error message with details.
6. Returns the `patientsWithAssessment` array containing patient data and their coverage assessments.

### `getCoverageAssessment`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves coverage assessment data for a single patient. It retrieves data from the patient model, generates a pre-signed URL for the medical record summary, and combines this information into a `CoverageAssessment` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer. |
| patient | PatientModel | The `PatientModel` object representing the patient to retrieve the coverage assessment for. |
| log | typeof console.log | A logging function. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;CoverageAssessment&gt; | Promise&lt;CoverageAssessment&gt; | A promise that resolves to a `CoverageAssessment` object containing the patient's coverage assessment data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates the file name for the medical record summary using `createMRSummaryFileName`.
2. Retrieves the count of FHIR resources and the pre-signed URL for the medical record summary concurrently using `Promise.all`.
3. Extracts document download and conversion status, document count, FHIR resource count and details from the patient data and the results of the previous step.
4. Constructs and returns a `CoverageAssessment` object containing the retrieved data.

### `getMrSummaryUrl`
#### Description
This asynchronous function generates a pre-signed URL for downloading a medical record summary from S3.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fileName | string | The name of the medical record summary file. |
| log | typeof console.log | A logging function. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;string \| undefined&gt; | Promise&lt;string \| undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to the pre-signed URL for the medical record summary, or `undefined` if the file does not exist or an error occurred. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an instance of `S3Utils` for interacting with S3.
2. Attempts to retrieve file information from S3 using `s3Utils.getFileInfoFromS3`.
3. If the file exists, generates a pre-signed URL for the file using `s3Utils.getSignedUrl` with a duration of 1 hour.
4. If the file does not exist, returns `undefined`.
5. If an error occurs during file information retrieval or pre-signed URL generation, logs an error message and returns `undefined`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation. |
| duration (dayjs plugin) | Duration handling for dayjs. |
| @metriport/core/util/concurrency | Provides asynchronous execution utilities. |
| @metriport/core/domain/medical-record-summary | Provides functions for generating medical record summary file names. |
| @metriport/core/external/aws/s3 | Provides utilities for interacting with AWS S3. |
| @metriport/core/util/log | Provides logging utilities. |
| @metriport/core/util/notifications | Provides utilities for sending notifications. |
| @metriport/shared | Provides shared utilities. |

### Configuration
The code utilizes the following configuration options from the `Config` class:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `getAWSRegion` | () =&gt; string | N/A | Returns the AWS region. |
| `getMedicalDocumentsBucketName` | () =&gt; string | N/A | Returns the name of the S3 bucket containing medical documents. |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling using try-catch blocks and the `capture.error` function to log and report errors encountered during coverage assessment retrieval and pre-signed URL generation.

## Logging
The code utilizes the `out` function from `@metriport/core/util/log` for logging messages during coverage assessment retrieval and pre-signed URL generation.
