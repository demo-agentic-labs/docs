## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript constants representing example FHIR resources (Patient, DiagnosticReport, Bundle) used for testing purposes, likely within the context of medical command handling in the API. 

## Symbols

### `patient`
#### Description
A constant representing an example FHIR `Patient` resource. This likely serves as test data for API endpoints or functions that interact with patient information.

#### Inputs
_This is a constant, it does not accept inputs._

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | `Patient` | An object representing a FHIR Patient resource with sample data (id: "1", name: "John Doe"). |

#### Internal Logic
_This is a constant definition, it does not contain internal logic._

### `diagnosticReport`
#### Description
A constant representing an example FHIR `DiagnosticReport` resource nested within a `BundleEntry`. This is likely used as test data for API endpoints or functions handling diagnostic reports.

#### Inputs
_This is a constant, it does not accept inputs._

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| diagnosticReport | `BundleEntry&lt;DiagnosticReport&gt;` | An object representing a FHIR BundleEntry containing a DiagnosticReport with sample data (status: "amended", code: "5678"). |

#### Internal Logic
_This is a constant definition, it does not contain internal logic._

### `transactionRespBundle`
#### Description
A constant representing an example FHIR `Bundle` resource simulating a successful transaction response. This is likely used to test API endpoints or functions that process transaction responses, particularly for updating DiagnosticReports.

#### Inputs
_This is a constant, it does not accept inputs._

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| transactionRespBundle | `Bundle` | An object representing a FHIR Bundle resource with a successful transaction response. It includes details like status, location, and an OperationOutcome indicating a successful update of a DiagnosticReport. |

#### Internal Logic
_This is a constant definition, it does not contain internal logic._

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources (Patient, Bundle, BundleEntry, DiagnosticReport). |
