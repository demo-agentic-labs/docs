## High-level description
This file, `external-ids.ts`, defines a single array named `externalDocRefIds` containing various example external document reference IDs. These IDs are used for testing purposes, likely to ensure that the system can handle a variety of valid ID formats. 

## Symbols

### `externalDocRefIds`
#### Description
This array holds a collection of strings representing different formats of external document reference IDs. These examples likely cover various standards and conventions used in healthcare and other domains.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not explicitly return any outputs. It defines a constant array that is likely imported and used by other modules for testing purposes.

#### Internal Logic
The array contains a diverse set of string literals, each representing a different external document reference ID format. Some examples include:

- HL7 OIDs: e.g., "2.16.840.1.113883.3.107.100.1.3.252.1.00805946.896751"
- UUIDs: e.g., "C5CD8A63-352F-4BCF-9ECA-92D7937CCFE5"
- URNs with OIDs: e.g., "urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.297.2.7.8.688883.1861863824"
- Custom formats: e.g., "9017481117802040^2019-07-30T17:10:41Z"

The variety of formats suggests that the system is designed to handle a wide range of external ID conventions.
