## High-level description
The `mapi-access.test.ts` file contains unit tests for the `allowMapiAccess` function, which is responsible for managing MAPI (most likely referring to Messaging Application Programming Interface) access for organizations. The tests ensure that the function correctly creates new access records when none exist and avoids creating duplicates when access is already granted.

## References
- `MAPIAccess` (from `../../../models/medical/mapi-access`)
- `makeOrganization` (from `../../../domain/medical/__tests__/organization`)
- `getOrganizationOrFail` (from `../organization/get-organization`)

### `allowMapiAccess` test suite
#### Description
This test suite verifies the behavior of the `allowMapiAccess` function. It uses mocks to simulate database interactions and asserts the expected outcomes based on different scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite includes two test cases:

1. **"returns when there is access"**:
    - **Arrange:** Mocks `MAPIAccess.findByPk` to return an existing access record and `getOrganizationOrFail` to return an organization.
    - **Act:** Calls `allowMapiAccess` with a sample `cxId`.
    - **Assert:** Verifies that `MAPIAccess.create` is not called (as access already exists) and `getOrganizationOrFail` is not called (as it's not needed in this scenario).

2. **"gives MAPI access when no access"**:
    - **Arrange:** Mocks `MAPIAccess.findByPk` to return `undefined` (no existing access), `MAPIAccess.create` to resolve successfully, and `getOrganizationOrFail` to return an organization.
    - **Act:** Calls `allowMapiAccess` with a sample `cxId`.
    - **Assert:** Verifies that `MAPIAccess.create` is called with the correct `cxId`, indicating a new access record is created.
