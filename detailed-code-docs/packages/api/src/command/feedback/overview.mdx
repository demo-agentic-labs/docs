## High-level description
This directory contains code for managing feedback and feedback entries related to AI briefs. It provides functionality for creating, retrieving, and updating feedback and feedback entries, as well as sending notifications when new feedback is received.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory handles the following main tasks:

1. Creating and updating feedback: It allows the creation of new feedback entries or updating existing ones associated with specific entities.

2. Retrieving feedback: It provides functions to fetch feedback by ID, either returning the feedback or throwing an error if not found.

3. Managing feedback entries: It enables the creation of new feedback entries associated with existing feedback, including comments and author information.

4. Notifications: When new feedback entries are created, it sends notifications to a Slack channel with details about the feedback.

5. Database interactions: It interacts with the database to store and retrieve feedback and feedback entry data using Sequelize models.

## Key Files

### feedback.ts
This file contains functions for managing the main feedback data:

- `createOrUpdateFeedback`: Creates a new feedback entry or updates an existing one.
- `getFeedback`: Retrieves a feedback entry by ID.
- `getFeedbackOrFail`: Retrieves a feedback entry by ID, throwing an error if not found.

### feedback-entry.ts
This file handles the creation and retrieval of feedback entries:

- `createFeedbackEntry`: Creates a new feedback entry and sends a Slack notification.
- `getFeedbackEntry`: Retrieves a feedback entry by ID.
- `getFeedbackEntryOrFail`: Retrieves a feedback entry by ID, throwing an error if not found.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `@metriport/core/external/aws/s3`: Used for generating signed URLs for S3 objects.
2. `@metriport/core/external/slack/index`: Used for sending notifications to Slack.
3. `@metriport/core/util/config`: Used for retrieving configuration values.
4. `@metriport/core/util/uuid-v7`: Used for generating UUIDs.
5. `@metriport/shared`: Provides shared utilities and error classes.
6. `dayjs`: Used for date and time manipulation.
7. `dayjs/plugin/duration`: A plugin for `dayjs` that adds duration functionality.

## Configuration
The code uses configuration values for:

1. Slack channel information for sending notifications.
2. S3 bucket information for generating signed URLs.

These configuration values are likely retrieved using the `@metriport/core/util/config` module.

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in several ways:

1. Using `NotFoundError` when feedback or feedback entries are not found.
2. Logging errors to the console when Slack notifications fail due to missing URLs.

Here's an example of how the `NotFoundError` is used in the `getFeedbackOrFail` function:

```typescript
export const getFeedbackOrFail = async ({ id }: { id: string }): Promise&lt;FeedbackModel&gt; =&gt; {
  const feedback = await getFeedback({ id });
  if (!feedback) {
    throw new NotFoundError(`Feedback not found: ${id}`);
  }
  return feedback;
};
```

This approach ensures that consumers of these functions can handle cases where the requested data is not available in the database.

The code structure allows for easy extension and maintenance of feedback-related functionality, providing a solid foundation for managing user feedback in the AI brief system.
