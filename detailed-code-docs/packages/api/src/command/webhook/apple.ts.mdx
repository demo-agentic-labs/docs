## High-level description
The `processAppleData` function processes Apple health data received from a webhook, maps it to the Metriport data model, and sends it to the appropriate webhook endpoint defined in the user's settings. It also reports device usage for the connected user.

## References
- `getConnectedUserOrFail` from `../connected-user/get-connected-user`
- `getSettingsOrFail` from `../settings/getSettings`
- `reportDevicesUsage` from `./devices`
- `processRequest` from `./webhook`
- `buildWebhookRequestData` from `./webhook-request`

## Symbols
### `processAppleData`
#### Description
This asynchronous function processes Apple health data received from a webhook. It retrieves the connected user, their settings, maps the received data to the Metriport data model, builds a webhook request, sends the request to the appropriate endpoint, and reports device usage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | `AppleWebhookPayload` | The Apple health data payload from the webhook. |
| metriportUserId | `string` | The ID of the Metriport user. |
| cxId | `string` | The ID of the customer. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value (returns `Promise&lt;void&gt;`).

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the connected user using `getConnectedUserOrFail`.
2. Retrieves the user's settings using `getSettingsOrFail`.
3. Constructs the payload for the webhook request, including the user ID and the received data.
4. Builds the webhook request data using `buildWebhookRequestData`, specifying the request type as "devices.health-data".
5. Sends the webhook request using `processRequest`.
6. Reports device usage using `reportDevicesUsage`.
7. Logs any errors encountered during the process.

## Side Effects
- Sends a webhook request to the endpoint defined in the user's settings.
- Updates device usage statistics for the connected user.

## Error Handling
The function uses a `try...catch` block to handle any errors encountered during the process. Errors are logged using the `log` function.
