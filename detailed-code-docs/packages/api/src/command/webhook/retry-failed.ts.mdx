## High-level description
The `retryFailedRequests` function attempts to retry previously failed webhook requests for a given customer. It retrieves failed requests from the database, marks them as processing, and then attempts to process them again, introducing a random delay between each retry.

## References
- `WebhookRequest`: This symbol is used to interact with webhook request data stored in the database.
- `getSettingsOrFail`: This symbol is used to retrieve customer settings.
- `processRequest`: This symbol is used to process a webhook request.
- `capture.error`: This symbol is used for error logging and reporting.
- `Util.sleep`: This symbol is used to introduce a delay between retries.

## Symbols
### `retryFailedRequests`
#### Description
This function retrieves failed webhook requests from the database, marks them as processing, and attempts to process them again. It introduces a random delay between each retry to avoid flooding the customer's server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The ID of the customer for whom to retry failed webhook requests. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value (Promise&lt;void&gt;).

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves customer settings using `getSettingsOrFail`.
2. Queries the database for webhook requests with `failure` status for the given `cxId`, ordered by creation date in ascending order.
3. If no failed requests are found, the function returns.
4. Updates the status of all retrieved failed requests to `processing` in the database.
5. Defines an asynchronous function `_processRequest` that iterates through the retrieved failed requests and attempts to process each one using `processRequest`.
    - If processing is successful, it introduces a random delay using `Util.sleep` to prevent flooding the customer's server.
    - Any errors during processing are captured and reported using `capture.error`.
6. Calls `_processRequest` asynchronously and catches any errors, reporting them using `processAsyncError`.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the status of webhook requests in the database.
- Makes HTTP requests to customer webhook URLs.
- Logs errors during processing.

#### Performance Considerations
- The random delay introduced between retries helps prevent overwhelming the customer's server.
- Processing of failed requests is done asynchronously to avoid blocking other operations.
- Error handling and logging are implemented to aid in debugging and monitoring.
