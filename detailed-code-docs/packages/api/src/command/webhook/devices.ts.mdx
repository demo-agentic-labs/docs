## High-level description
The `devices.ts` file handles webhook events related to user devices and health data. It includes functions for sending notifications to the CX (customer) about provider connections and disconnections, processing incoming device data from various providers (Withings, Garmin, Tenovi, Fitbit), and reporting device usage.

## Code Structure
The code defines several types and functions related to handling device data and webhooks. It uses functions like `sendProviderConnected` and `sendProviderDisconnected` to notify the CX about changes in user-provider connections. Functions like `processData` (for Garmin, Fitbit) and `processMeasurementData` (for Tenovi) handle incoming data from different providers, while `mapData` maps the provider-specific data to a standardized format. The `reportDevicesUsage` function is used to track device usage.

### `processData` (Garmin)
#### Description
Processes incoming Garmin webhook data, maps it to the Metriport format, groups it by customer and user, and sends it to the CX.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | UserData[] | An array of Garmin user data objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Group data by customer and user:**
    - Iterates through each data object and retrieves the associated customer and user IDs using the user access token.
    - Groups the data by customer ID and then by user ID within each customer.
2. **Process data for each customer:**
    - Iterates through each customer and their associated data.
    - Splits the data into chunks of 10 data points.
    - For each chunk:
        - Groups the data by user ID.
        - For each user, groups the data by data type (e.g., activity, sleep).
        - Creates a webhook payload with the grouped data.
    - Sends the webhook payloads to the customer using `processOneCustomer`.
    - Reports device usage for all users in the customer's data.
3. **Error handling:**
    - Logs any errors encountered during data processing.

### `processOneCustomer` (Garmin)
#### Description
Processes and sends webhook payloads for a single customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The customer ID. |
| settings | Settings | The customer's settings. |
| payloads | WebhookDataPayloadWithoutMessageId[] | An array of webhook payloads for the customer. |

#### Internal Logic
- Iterates through each payload.
- Creates a webhook request data object using `buildWebhookRequestData`.
- Sends the webhook request to the customer using `processRequest`.
- Sleeps for a random duration between 0 and 200 milliseconds to avoid flooding the customer's system.

### `processMeasurementData` (Tenovi)
#### Description

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | TenoviMeasurement | The Tenovi measurement data. |

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves the connected users associated with the device ID from the Tenovi measurement data.
- Maps the Tenovi measurement data to the Metriport format using `mapData`.
- If the mapping is successful, creates and sends a webhook payload for each connected user using `createAndSendPayload`.
- Logs any errors encountered during the process.

#### Internal Logic
- Extracts relevant data from the Tenovi measurement object.
- Creates a `Biometrics` object with metadata and populates it with the mapped Tenovi data.
- If the measurement is "weight", creates a `Body` object with metadata and weight in kilograms.
