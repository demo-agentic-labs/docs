## High-level description
The `garmin.ts` file handles incoming webhooks from Garmin, processes the data, and sends it to the appropriate Metriport customers. It maps Garmin data to Metriport's internal format, associates it with the correct customer accounts, and sends it in batches to the customer's webhook endpoint.

## Code Structure
The `processData` function is the main entry point, responsible for orchestrating the data processing pipeline. It uses helper functions like `getUserTokenByUAT`, `getConnectedUsers`, `getSettingsOrFail`, `processOneCustomer`, and `buildWebhookRequestData` to perform specific tasks. The `processOneCustomer` function further breaks down the processing for each customer, chunking the data and sending it in separate payloads.

## References
- `getUserTokenByUAT` from `../cx-user/get-user-token`
- `getConnectedUsers` from `../connected-user/get-connected-user`
- `getSettingsOrFail` from `../settings/getSettings`
- `processRequest` from `./webhook`
- `buildWebhookRequestData` from `./webhook-request`
- `UserData` from `../../mappings/garmin`
- `MetriportData`, `TypedData`, `WebhookDataPayloadWithoutMessageId`, `WebhookUserPayload`, `reportDevicesUsage` from `./devices`

### `processData`
#### Description
This function processes incoming Garmin webhook data, maps it to the corresponding Metriport customers, and sends it to the customer's webhook endpoint.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | `UserData&lt;T extends MetriportData&gt;[]` | An array of Garmin user data, already converted to Metriport's internal format. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value (Promise&lt;void&gt;).

#### Internal Logic
1. **Associate Garmin data with Metriport customers:**
    - Iterate through each Garmin user data record.
    - Retrieve the user's access token (UAT).
    - Use the UAT to find the corresponding Metriport customer IDs and user IDs.
    - Associate the Garmin data with the retrieved customer and user IDs.
2. **Group data by customer:**
    - Group all data records by their respective customer ID.
3. **Process data for each customer:**
    - Process each customer's data in parallel using `Promise.allSettled`.
    - For each customer:
        - Flatten the list of data records and their corresponding user IDs.
        - Split the data into chunks of 10 records.
        - For each chunk:
            - Group the data by user ID.
            - For each user:
                - Group the user's data by data type (e.g., activity, sleep).
                - Create a `WebhookUserPayload` object containing the user ID and their data for each type.
            - Create a `WebhookDataPayloadWithoutMessageId` object containing the list of `WebhookUserPayload` objects.
        - Retrieve the customer's settings.
        - Process the customer's data chunks using `processOneCustomer`.
        - Report device usage for the customer.
4. **Handle errors:**
    - Log any errors encountered during processing.

### `processOneCustomer`
#### Description
This function processes the data for a single customer by sending it to the customer's webhook endpoint in chunks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | `string` | The Metriport customer ID. |
| settings | `Settings` | The customer's settings, including webhook URL and key. |
| payloads | `WebhookDataPayloadWithoutMessageId[]` | An array of webhook payloads containing the customer's data, chunked into groups. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| success | `boolean` | Returns `true` if all payloads were processed successfully, otherwise `false`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Iterate through each payload:**
    - For each payload in the `payloads` array:
        - Create a `WebhookRequestData` object representing the webhook request.
        - Send the payload to the customer's webhook endpoint using `processRequest`.
        - If the request was successful, wait for a random amount of time (up to 200ms) to prevent flooding the customer's endpoint.
2. **Return success status:**
    - Return `true` if all payloads were processed successfully, otherwise `false`.

## Side Effects
- This code modifies the database by storing webhook request data and updating customer settings.
- It sends HTTP requests to customer webhook endpoints.
- It reports device usage for customers.

## Error Handling
The code uses try-catch blocks to handle errors during data processing and sending webhook requests. Errors are logged, and the webhook request status is updated accordingly.

## Logging
The code uses a logger (`Util.log`) to log information about the data processing pipeline, including errors and successful requests.
