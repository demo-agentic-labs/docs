## High-level description
This directory contains modules for processing webhooks from various health data providers (Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Tenovi, Withings) and managing webhook requests. It includes functionality for mapping provider-specific data to Metriport's internal format, sending webhook requests to customers, and handling webhook-related operations such as retrying failed requests and sending test payloads.

## What does it do?
1. Processes incoming webhooks from health data providers:
   - Receives raw data from providers like Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Tenovi, and Withings.
   - Maps the provider-specific data to Metriport's standardized format.
   - Groups data by customer and user.

2. Manages webhook requests:
   - Creates, updates, and retrieves webhook requests in the database.
   - Builds webhook request payloads.
   - Sends webhook requests to customer-defined endpoints.
   - Handles webhook request statuses (processing, success, failure).

3. Implements webhook-related operations:
   - Retries failed webhook requests.
   - Sends test payloads to verify webhook connectivity.
   - Reports device usage for connected users.

4. Handles error scenarios and logging:
   - Manages timeouts and connection issues.
   - Logs errors and updates webhook statuses accordingly.
   - Implements analytics tracking for webhook events.

## Entry points
- `apple.ts`: Processes Apple health data webhooks.
- `fitbit.ts`: Handles Fitbit webhooks.
- `garmin.ts`: Processes Garmin webhooks.
- `tenovi.ts`: Manages Tenovi measurement webhooks.
- `withings.ts`: Handles Withings webhooks.
- `webhook.ts`: Main module for processing and sending webhook requests.
- `retry-failed.ts`: Entry point for retrying failed webhook requests.

The workflow typically starts with a provider-specific module (e.g., `apple.ts`, `fitbit.ts`) receiving webhook data. This data is then processed, mapped to Metriport's format, and passed to the `webhook.ts` module for sending to the customer's endpoint. The `webhook-request.ts` module is used throughout for managing webhook request objects in the database.

## Key Files
1. `webhook.ts`: Core module for processing and sending webhook requests.
   - Handles sending payloads to customer endpoints.
   - Manages webhook settings and statuses.
   - Implements error handling and analytics tracking.

2. `webhook-request.ts`: Manages webhook request objects in the database.
   - Provides functions for creating, updating, and retrieving webhook requests.
   - Defines types and structures for webhook request data.

3. `devices.ts`: Handles device-related webhook processing.
   - Manages provider connections and disconnections.
   - Processes incoming device data from various providers.
   - Reports device usage.

4. `retry-failed.ts`: Implements functionality for retrying failed webhook requests.
   - Retrieves failed requests from the database.
   - Attempts to reprocess and resend failed requests.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/api-sdk`: Provides data models and utility functions for interacting with health data providers.
- `@metriport/core`: Imports various utilities and constants.
- `axios`: Used for making HTTP requests to customer endpoints.
- `crypto`: Used for generating HMAC signatures for webhook payloads.
- `dayjs`: Used for date and time manipulation.
- `nanoid` and `uuid`: Used for generating unique identifiers.
- `zod`: Used for data validation.

## Configuration
The webhook processing relies on customer-specific settings, including:
- Webhook URL: The endpoint where webhook payloads should be sent.
- Webhook Key: Used for generating signatures to verify webhook authenticity.
- Webhook status: Indicates whether the webhook is enabled or disabled.

These settings are typically retrieved using the `getSettingsOrFail` function from the customer's settings.

Environment variables and feature flags may also influence webhook behavior, such as timeout durations or specific processing rules.

The code includes TODO comments indicating areas for future improvements or removals, particularly related to the deprecation of DAPI (Devices API) functionality.
