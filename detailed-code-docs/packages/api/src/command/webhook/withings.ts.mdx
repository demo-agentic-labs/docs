## High-level description
The code defines a webhook processor for Withings, handling incoming data from Withings webhooks and processing it for a specific user. It maps the Withings data to Metriport's data format and sends it to the appropriate webhook endpoint defined in the user's settings.

## Code Structure
The `processData` function acts as the main entry point, receiving the webhook data, fetching user and settings information, mapping the data, and triggering the webhook request. The `mapData` function handles the mapping of Withings data to Metriport's format based on the data category.

## References
- `getConnectedUserByTokenOrFail` from `../connected-user/get-connected-user`
- `getSettingsOrFail` from `../settings/getSettings`
- `reportDevicesUsage`, `WebhookUserDataPayload` from `./devices`
- `processRequest` from `./webhook`
- `buildWebhookRequestData` from `./webhook-request`

## Symbols
### `processData`
#### Description
This function processes incoming Withings webhook data. It retrieves the connected user, maps the Withings data to the Metriport format, builds a webhook request, and sends it using the `processRequest` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | `WithingsWebhook` | The raw webhook data received from Withings. |

#### Outputs
This function does not explicitly return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts relevant data from the `WithingsWebhook` object.
2. Fetches the connected user using `getConnectedUserByTokenOrFail`.
3. Retrieves the user's settings using `getSettingsOrFail`.
4. Maps the Withings data to the Metriport format using `mapData`.
5. Builds the webhook request data using `buildWebhookRequestData`.
6. Sends the webhook request using `processRequest`.
7. Reports device usage using `reportDevicesUsage`.
8. Logs any errors encountered during the process.

### `mapData`
#### Description
This function maps Withings data to the Metriport format based on the data category.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| categoryNum | `string` | The category of the Withings data. |
| connectedUser | `ConnectedUser` | The connected user object. |
| startdate | `string` | The start date of the data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | `WebhookUserDataPayload` | The mapped data in Metriport's format. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an empty `WebhookUserDataPayload` object.
2. Based on the `categoryNum`, fetches the corresponding data from the Withings provider using methods like `getActivityData`, `getBodyData`, `getBiometricsData`, or `getSleepData`.
3. Populates the `payload` object with the fetched and mapped data.
4. Returns the `payload` object.

## Error Handling
The `processData` function includes a try-catch block to handle any errors during the processing of Withings webhook data. Errors are logged to the console.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` for logging errors and the received webhook payload.
