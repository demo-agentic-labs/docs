## High-level description
This TypeScript file provides utility types to expand complex types for better visualization in VSCode's inspector. It addresses a limitation in VSCode where complex types are not properly expanded when hovering over them.

## Symbols

### `Expand&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
This type alias expands object types one level deep. It's designed to improve type visualization in VSCode's inspector.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| T | Generic | The type to be expanded |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Expanded Type | Object | An expanded version of the input type, with one level of nesting resolved |

#### Internal Logic
The type uses a conditional type to check if `T` extends `infer O`. If true, it creates a new object type with the same keys as `O`, but with each value type directly referenced. This effectively "expands" the type one level deep.

___

### `ExpandRecursively&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
This type alias recursively expands object types to their full depth. It's designed to provide a complete expansion of complex types for better visualization in VSCode's inspector.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| T | Generic | The type to be recursively expanded |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Recursively Expanded Type | Object or T | A fully expanded version of the input type, with all levels of nesting resolved |

#### Internal Logic
The type uses a conditional type to check if `T` extends `object`. If true, it creates a new object type with the same keys as `T`, but recursively applies `ExpandRecursively` to each value type. This process continues until a non-object type is encountered, at which point the original type is returned.

## Notes
1. Both `Expand` and `ExpandRecursively` are marked as `@deprecated`. This is intentional, as they are meant to be temporary workarounds for local development environments only.
2. These types should not be used to update actual domain types sent to remote branches.
3. The implementation is based on a Stack Overflow answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/57683652/2099911).
4. There is an open issue in the VSCode repository (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/94679) to address the underlying problem that necessitates these utility types.

## TODOs
While there are no explicit TODOs in the code, the deprecation notices and the reference to the VSCode issue suggest that these utility types should be removed once VSCode properly supports expanding complex types in its inspector.
