## High-level description
This code defines a function `makeOrganizationOID` that generates a unique Organization Identifier (OID) by combining a system root OID, an organization node identifier, and a provided organization number. It's part of a larger system for managing and creating standardized identifiers within a healthcare or similar context.

## References
- `OIDNode` from "@metriport/core/domain/oid"

### `makeOrganizationOID`
#### Description
This function creates a unique Organization Identifier (OID) by concatenating three parts: the system root OID, the organizations node identifier, and a provided organization number.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgNumber | string \| number | The unique identifier for the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | string | The generated Organization OID |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the system root OID using `Config.getSystemRootOID()`.
2. Uses the `OIDNode.organizations` constant as the organization node identifier.
3. Concatenates the system root OID, organization node, and provided organization number with periods (`.`) as separators.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/oid | Imports the `OIDNode` enum for standardized node identifiers |
| ./config | Imports the `Config` object, likely for system-wide configuration |

## Additional Context
The related code snippet provides additional context about the OID system:

1. It defines an `OIDNode` enum, which includes various categories of identifiers, including `organizations` used in this file.
2. The `OID_PREFIX` constant ("urn:oid:") is defined, which might be used elsewhere in the system to create full URN-formatted OIDs.
3. There are other OID-related utilities and constants defined, such as driver's license URIs for different US states, which suggests this is part of a larger system for managing various types of identifiers in a healthcare or similar context.

While not directly used in the target file, this related information helps understand the broader OID system this function is a part of.
