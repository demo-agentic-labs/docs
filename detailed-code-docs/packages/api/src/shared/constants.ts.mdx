## High-level description
This code defines constants, types, and functions related to various healthcare providers and their integration with the Metriport API. It includes mappings for different data types (e.g., activity, biometrics, body, nutrition, sleep) from various providers to a standardized format, as well as authentication and connection handling for these providers.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several modules, each handling specific aspects of the API:
1. Constants and types definitions
2. Provider-specific mappings and data transformations
3. Authentication and connection handling
4. API routes and middleware
5. Data processing and webhook handling

These modules interact to provide a cohesive system for integrating multiple healthcare data providers into the Metriport API.

## Symbols

### Constants
#### Description
Defines various constants used throughout the application, including provider names, OAuth configurations, and data types.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines provider names as constants
- Sets up OAuth configurations for different providers
- Defines schemas for provider options and data types

### OAuth1DefaultImpl
#### Description
Implements OAuth1 authentication flow for providers that use this protocol.

#### Internal Logic
- Handles token generation and exchange
- Manages user authentication and authorization
- Provides methods for revoking access and deregistering users

### OAuth2DefaultImpl
#### Description
Implements OAuth2 authentication flow for providers that use this protocol.

#### Internal Logic
- Manages authorization URI generation
- Handles token exchange and refresh
- Provides methods for revoking access and fetching provider data

### Provider (abstract class)
#### Description
Base class for all healthcare data providers.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines interface for data retrieval methods (e.g., getActivityData, getBiometricsData)
- Manages supported data types for each provider

### Mapping Functions (e.g., mapToActivity, mapToBiometrics)
#### Description
Functions that transform provider-specific data into standardized Metriport formats.

#### Internal Logic
- Extracts relevant data from provider responses
- Converts units and formats as necessary
- Constructs standardized objects for each data type

### ConnectedUser
#### Description
Represents a user connected to one or more healthcare providers.

#### Internal Logic
- Stores user information and provider connections
- Manages provider-specific tokens and device IDs

### API Routes (e.g., /connect, /user)
#### Description
Define API endpoints for user management and provider connections.

#### Internal Logic
- Handle user creation and provider connections
- Manage OAuth flows for different providers
- Process incoming webhooks from providers

## Dependencies
- @metriport/api-sdk: Provides types and models for the API
- simple-oauth2: Handles OAuth2 authentication flows
- express: Web framework for handling HTTP requests
- zod: Schema validation library
- dayjs: Date manipulation library
- lodash: Utility functions for data manipulation

## Error Handling
The code uses custom error classes (e.g., MetriportError, BadRequestError) for specific error scenarios. Try-catch blocks are used in asynchronous functions to catch and handle errors appropriately.

## Logging
Console.log is used for basic logging throughout the code. Some modules use a custom logging utility (e.g., Util.log) for more structured logging.

## API/Interface Reference
The main API endpoints include:
- POST /user: Create a new user
- GET /user/connect/token: Generate an auth token for connect widget session
- GET /connect/redirect: Generate auth URL for a provider
- GET /connect/:provider: Handle OAuth callback and store provider token
- POST /connect/rpm/:provider: Connect user to RPM device provider

## TODOs
There are several TODOs mentioned in the code, including:
- Implement user-revoked access handling
- Improve token matching for connected users
- Include more thorough breakdown of heart rate data

This code provides a flexible and extensible system for integrating multiple healthcare data providers into a single API, handling authentication, data retrieval, and standardization of various health-related data types.
