## High-level description
This code defines a set of sample document references for a user named William. It exports an array of data entries, each containing information about a document's storage in S3 and its corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary types and constants from a related file and then defines an array of data entries. Each entry represents a document with its S3 storage information and FHIR DocumentReference details.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `williamDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document associated with William. Each entry contains S3 storage information and a FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| williamDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of document reference entries for William |

#### Internal Logic
The array contains four entries, each following a similar structure:
1. S3 information (bucket and key)
2. DocumentReference resource with:
   - resourceType
   - id (a unique identifier)
   - content array with attachment details (title, URL, and contentType)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (implied from the related file) |

## Configuration
The code uses a `bucket` constant imported from another file, which is likely configured elsewhere in the application.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API itself, this data structure could be used as part of an API or internal data seeding process. The structure of each `DataEntry` is as follows:

```typescript
{
  s3Info: {
    bucket: string,
    key: string
  },
  docRef: {
    resourceType: "DocumentReference",
    id: string,
    content: [
      {
        attachment: {
          title: string,
          url: string,
          contentType: string
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This structure represents both the S3 storage location and the FHIR DocumentReference for each document.
