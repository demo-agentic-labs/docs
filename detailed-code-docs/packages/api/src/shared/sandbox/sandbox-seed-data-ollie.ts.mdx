## High-level description
This code defines a constant array `ollieDocRefs` containing seed data for document references related to a user named Ollie. Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary types and constants from a related file and then defines a single constant array `ollieDocRefs`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `ollieDocRefs`
#### Description
A constant array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document reference for Ollie's medical records.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a constant)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ollieDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of document reference entries |

#### Internal Logic
Each entry in the `ollieDocRefs` array contains:
1. `s3Info`: Object with S3 bucket and key information
2. `docRef`: FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
   - `resourceType`: Always set to "DocumentReference"
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document
   - `content`: An array with a single attachment object containing:
     - `title`: The filename
     - `url`: Set to "http://api.metriport.com"
     - `contentType`: The MIME type of the document

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (imported in the related file) |

## Configuration
The code uses a `bucket` constant imported from another file, which is likely configured elsewhere in the application.

## Notes
1. The documents referenced include various file types: XML, PDF, and TIFF images.
2. All documents use the same URL ("http://api.metriport.com"), which might be a placeholder or a base URL for document retrieval.
3. The `id` fields of the DocumentReference resources are base64-encoded strings, possibly representing unique identifiers.
4. This seed data is likely used for testing, development, or demonstration purposes in a sandbox environment.
