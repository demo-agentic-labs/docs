title: "sandbox-seed-data-wanda.ts"

## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `wandaDocRefs` containing seed data for document references related to a user named Wanda. Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The file imports necessary types and constants from a related file (`sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts`) and defines a single exported constant `wandaDocRefs`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults".

## Symbols

### `wandaDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document associated with Wanda. Each entry contains S3 storage information and a FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Type
`DataEntry[]`

#### Internal Logic
The array is populated with six entries, each following a similar structure:
1. S3 information (bucket and key)
2. DocumentReference resource with:
   - resourceType
   - id (a unique identifier)
   - content array with an attachment object containing:
     - title (filename)
     - url (always set to "http://api.metriport.com")
     - contentType (based on the file extension)

The documents include various file types: XML, PDF, and TIFF images.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (implicitly used through `sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts`) |

## Configuration
The `bucket` value is imported from `sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts`, which in turn uses `Config.getSandboxSeedBucketName()` to determine the S3 bucket name.

## Notes
1. All document URLs are set to "http://api.metriport.com", which might be a placeholder or default value.
2. The file extensions in the S3 keys correspond to the contentType in the DocumentReference.
3. The IDs for each DocumentReference appear to be base64-encoded strings, possibly representing UUIDs.
4. This seed data is likely used for testing, development, or demonstration purposes in a sandbox environment.
