title: "sandbox-seed-data-hajra.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `hajraDocRefs` containing seed data for document references in a sandbox environment. Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The file imports necessary types and constants from related files and defines a single exported constant `hajraDocRefs`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `hajraDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document with its S3 storage information and FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Inputs
N/A (constant)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hajraDocRefs | DataEntry[] | Array of document reference entries |

#### Internal Logic
Each entry in the `hajraDocRefs` array follows a consistent structure:
1. `s3Info`: Contains the S3 bucket name and the key (filename) of the document.
2. `docRef`: Defines a FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
   - `resourceType`: Always set to "DocumentReference"
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document
   - `content`: An array with a single attachment object containing:
     - `title`: The filename of the document
     - `url`: Set to "http://api.metriport.com" for all entries
     - `contentType`: The MIME type of the document

The array includes 6 document references with varying file types (XML, PDF, TIF, PNG) and unique identifiers.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (imported in the related file) |

## Configuration
The `bucket` constant is imported from a related file, which appears to use a configuration system to set the S3 bucket name for sandbox seed data.

## Notes
1. The `url` field in all document references is set to "http://api.metriport.com", which might be a placeholder or default value.
2. The `id` fields appear to be base64-encoded strings, possibly representing UUIDs or other unique identifiers.
3. This file seems to be part of a larger system for managing medical documents in a FHIR-compliant format, with integration to S3 storage.
