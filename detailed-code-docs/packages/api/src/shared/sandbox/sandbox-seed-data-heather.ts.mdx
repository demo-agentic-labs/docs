## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `heatherDocRefs` containing seed data for document references related to a user named Heather. Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource details.

## Symbols

### `heatherDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document associated with Heather. The array contains information about various documents including XML, PDF, and TIFF files.

#### Inputs
This is a constant, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| heatherDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of DataEntry objects representing Heather's documents |

#### Internal Logic
Each `DataEntry` object in the array contains two main parts:
1. `s3Info`: Specifies the S3 bucket and key for the document's storage.
2. `docRef`: Defines the FHIR DocumentReference resource for the document, including:
   - `resourceType`: Always set to "DocumentReference"
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document
   - `content`: An array with a single object containing attachment information:
     - `title`: The filename
     - `url`: Set to "http://api.metriport.com" for all entries
     - `contentType`: The MIME type of the document

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./sandbox-seed-data-defaults | Imports `bucket` and `DataEntry` type |

## References
This file references the following symbols from other parts of the codebase:
- `bucket`: Imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults", likely defines the S3 bucket name
- `DataEntry`: Imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults", defines the structure of each entry in the array

## Notes
1. All documents use the same URL ("http://api.metriport.com") in their DocumentReference content.
2. The `id` field for each DocumentReference appears to be a base64-encoded string, possibly representing a unique identifier.
3. The file includes various document types: XML, PDF, and TIFF (both as "application/tif" and "image/tiff").
4. This seed data is likely used for testing or development purposes, providing a set of sample documents for a user named Heather.
