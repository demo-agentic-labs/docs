## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `aaminaDocRefs` containing seed data for document references related to a user named Aamina. The data includes information about various documents stored in an S3 bucket, along with their corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resources.

## Code Structure
The file imports necessary types and constants from a related file and then defines a single exported constant `aaminaDocRefs`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `aaminaDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document reference for Aamina's medical records.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a constant)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| aaminaDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of document reference entries |

#### Internal Logic
Each entry in the `aaminaDocRefs` array contains:
1. `s3Info`: Object with `bucket` and `key` properties for S3 storage information.
2. `docRef`: A FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
   - `resourceType`: Always set to "DocumentReference"
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document
   - `content`: An array with a single object containing attachment information:
     - `title`: The filename
     - `url`: Set to "http://api.metriport.com" for all entries
     - `contentType`: The MIME type of the document

The array includes 6 document references with varying file types (XML, PDF, JPEG) and unique identifiers.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (imported in the related file) |

## Configuration
The `bucket` constant is imported from a separate file, which appears to use a configuration system to determine the S3 bucket name for sandbox seed data.

## Notes
1. All document URLs are set to "http://api.metriport.com", which might be a placeholder or default value.
2. The file names suggest these are medical documents for a patient named Aamina.
3. The document IDs are long strings that appear to be randomly generated, possibly UUIDs or similar unique identifiers.
4. This seed data is likely used for testing, development, or demonstration purposes in a sandbox environment.
