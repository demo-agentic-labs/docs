title: "sandbox-seed-data-jane.ts"

## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `janeDocRefs` containing seed data for document references associated with a patient named Jane. It's part of a sandbox environment, likely used for testing or development purposes, and includes various types of medical documents with their corresponding S3 storage information and FHIR DocumentReference resources.

## References
- The file imports `bucket` and `DataEntry` from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults".
- It's used by the `seedData` object in "packages/api/src/shared/sandbox/sandbox-seed-data.ts".

## Symbols

### `janeDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects representing document references for a patient named Jane. Each entry contains S3 storage information and a FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Inputs
None (it's a constant)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| janeDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of document reference entries |

#### Internal Logic
The array contains seven entries, each representing a different document:
1. An XML file (jane1.xml)
2. Three PDF files (jane11.pdf, jane12.pdf, jane13.pdf)
3. Two JPEG images (jane14.jpeg, jane16.jpeg)
4. One TIFF image (jane15.tif)

Each entry follows this structure:
- `s3Info`: Contains the S3 bucket name and the file key
- `docRef`: A FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
  - `resourceType`: Always "DocumentReference"
  - `id`: A unique identifier
  - `content`: An array with one attachment object containing:
    - `title`: The filename
    - `url`: Always "http://api.metriport.com"
    - `contentType`: The MIME type of the file
    - `creation`: The creation date (only for some entries)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sandbox-seed-data-defaults | Imports `bucket` and `DataEntry` type |

## Notes
- The `bucket` variable is imported and used for all S3 bucket names, suggesting a centralized configuration for the sandbox environment.
- The document references use a consistent URL ("http://api.metriport.com") which is likely a placeholder or a base URL for the API.
- Not all entries include a `creation` date in the attachment information.
- The `id` fields appear to be base64-encoded strings, possibly representing unique identifiers for each document.

This file is part of a larger sandbox data seeding system, where each patient has their own set of document references. It's used in conjunction with other patient-specific seed data files to create a comprehensive test environment.
