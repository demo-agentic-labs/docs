## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `gavinDocRefs` containing seed data for document references in a sandbox environment. It provides structured information about various documents, including their S3 storage details and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resources.

## Code Structure
The file imports necessary types and constants from a related file and then defines a single constant array `gavinDocRefs` containing multiple `DataEntry` objects.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `gavinDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects representing document references for various files associated with "Gavin".

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a constant array)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gavinDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of document reference entries |

#### Internal Logic
The array contains three `DataEntry` objects, each representing a different document:
1. An XML file named "gavin1.xml"
2. A TIFF image named "gavin11.tif"
3. A JPEG image named "gavin12.jpeg"

Each entry includes:
- S3 storage information (bucket and key)
- A FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
  - A unique ID
  - Content information including the file title, a placeholder URL, and the content type

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (implicitly used via the imported file) |

## Configuration
The code relies on the `bucket` constant imported from "sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts", which is presumably configured elsewhere in the application.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a static array of constant data, there are no significant performance considerations. However, if this array grows very large, it may impact memory usage when the module is loaded.
