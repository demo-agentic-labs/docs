## High-level description
This code defines a constant array `lexiDocRefs` containing sample data entries for document references. Each entry includes S3 storage information and a corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource. This data is likely used for seeding or testing purposes in a sandbox environment.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary types and constants from related files and then defines a single exported constant `lexiDocRefs`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `lexiDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document with its S3 storage information and FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a constant)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lexiDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of document reference entries |

#### Internal Logic
Each entry in the `lexiDocRefs` array follows this structure:
1. `s3Info`: Contains the S3 bucket name and the key (filename) of the document.
2. `docRef`: A FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
   - `resourceType`: Always set to "DocumentReference"
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document
   - `content`: An array with a single attachment object containing:
     - `title`: The filename of the document
     - `url`: Set to "http://api.metriport.com" for all entries
     - `contentType`: The MIME type of the document

The array includes six entries with different file types (XML, PDF, TIF, PNG) and unique identifiers.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (imported in the related file) |

## Configuration
The code uses a `bucket` constant imported from another file, which is likely configured elsewhere in the application.

## Notes
1. The `bucket` value is shared across all entries and is imported from another file.
2. All document references use the same URL ("http://api.metriport.com"), which might be a placeholder or a base URL for the API.
3. The document IDs appear to be base64-encoded strings, possibly representing UUIDs or other unique identifiers.
4. This data structure suggests that the application deals with various document types (XML, PDF, TIF, PNG) and uses S3 for storage while maintaining FHIR-compliant document references.
