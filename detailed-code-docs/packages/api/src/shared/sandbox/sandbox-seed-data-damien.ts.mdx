title: "sandbox-seed-data-damien.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `damienDocRefs` containing seed data for document references. Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The file imports `bucket` and `DataEntry` from a related file and defines a single constant array `damienDocRefs` of type `DataEntry[]`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `damienDocRefs`
#### Description
A constant array containing predefined document reference data for various files associated with "Damien". Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a constant array)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| damienDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of DataEntry objects representing document references |

#### Internal Logic
The array contains six entries, each following the `DataEntry` structure:
1. S3 information (bucket and key)
2. DocumentReference resource (id, content with attachment details)

Each entry represents a different file (XML, TIF, or JPEG) with unique identifiers and content types.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (indirectly through imported types) |

## Configuration
The `bucket` value is imported from another file, which likely retrieves it from a configuration setting.

## Notes
1. All document references use the same URL "http://api.metriport.com" for the attachment.
2. The `id` fields of the DocumentReference resources are base64-encoded strings, possibly representing unique identifiers.
3. The file types included are XML, TIF, and JPEG, each with appropriate content types.
4. This data is likely used for seeding a sandbox environment with test data for the "Damien" user or scenario.
