title: "sandbox-seed-data-kyla.ts"

## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `kylaDocRefs` containing seed data for document references. Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The file imports necessary types and constants from a related file (`sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts`) and exports a single constant array `kylaDocRefs`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults".

## Symbols

### `kylaDocRefs`
#### Description
A constant array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document with its S3 storage information and FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a constant, not a function)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| kylaDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of DataEntry objects |

#### Internal Logic
The array contains six entries, each following the same structure:
1. `s3Info`: Contains the S3 bucket name and the key (filename) of the document.
2. `docRef`: A FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
   - `resourceType`: Always set to "DocumentReference"
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document
   - `content`: An array with one object containing attachment information:
     - `title`: The filename
     - `url`: Set to "http://api.metriport.com" for all entries
     - `contentType`: The MIME type of the document

The documents represented are:
1. kyla1.xml (XML file)
2. kyla11.pdf (PDF file)
3. kyla12.pdf (PDF file)
4. kyla13.pdf (PDF file)
5. kyla14.tif (TIFF image)
6. kyla15.tif (TIFF image)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (imported in the related file) |

## Configuration
The `bucket` constant is imported from `sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts`, which appears to use a configuration value for the S3 bucket name.

## Notes
1. The `url` field in all document references is set to "http://api.metriport.com", which might be a placeholder or default value.
2. The `id` fields contain seemingly random strings, which are likely unique identifiers for each document.
3. This seed data appears to be for a user named "Kyla" given the file name and document names.
4. The purpose of this seed data is likely for testing or initializing a sandbox environment with sample documents.
