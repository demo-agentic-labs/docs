## High-level description
This directory contains code for managing sandbox seed data in a healthcare-related application. It provides a set of predefined document references and patient data for various fictional patients, which can be used for testing, development, or demonstration purposes in a sandbox environment.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory creates a simulated environment with sample patient data and associated medical documents. It allows developers or testers to:

1. Access predefined patient information, including demographics and document references.
2. Retrieve document references for specific patients, which include details about the document's storage in S3 and its corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.
3. Match patient data against the predefined seed data.
4. Use this data to test various scenarios in a healthcare application without using real patient information.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `sandbox-seed-data.ts` file. This file contains:

1. The `seedData` object, which holds all the patient entries with their demographics and document references.
2. The `patientMatches` function, which checks if a given patient's data matches the seed data.
3. The `getSandboxSeedData` function, which retrieves seed data for a given patient key.

Other files in the directory (e.g., `sandbox-seed-data-aamina.ts`, `sandbox-seed-data-andreas.ts`, etc.) define document references for specific patients. These are imported and used in the main `sandbox-seed-data.ts` file.

## Key Files
1. `sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts`: Defines default values and types used across other files in the directory.
2. `sandbox-seed-data.ts`: The main file that aggregates all patient data and provides functions for data retrieval and matching.
3. Patient-specific files (e.g., `sandbox-seed-data-aamina.ts`, `sandbox-seed-data-andreas.ts`): Each file contains document references for a specific patient.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `@medplum/fhirtypes`: Used for FHIR type definitions.
2. `@metriport/core/domain/address`: Provides the `Address` type.
3. `@metriport/core/domain/patient`: Provides the `PatientData` type.
4. `@metriport/shared`: Provides the `USState` type.

## Configuration
The sandbox environment uses a configuration system to determine the S3 bucket name for storing seed data. This is managed through the `Config.getSandboxSeedBucketName()` method, which is used in the `sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts` file.

The `bucket` constant is defined in `sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts` and is used across all patient-specific files to ensure consistency in S3 storage locations.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools and data for creating a realistic sandbox environment for healthcare application development and testing. It allows developers to work with consistent, predefined patient data and document references without risking exposure of real patient information.
