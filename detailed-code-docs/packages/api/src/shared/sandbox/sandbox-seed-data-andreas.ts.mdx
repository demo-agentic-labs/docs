title: "sandbox-seed-data-andreas.ts"

## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `andreasDocRefs` containing seed data for document references. Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The file imports `bucket` and `DataEntry` from a related file and exports a single constant array `andreasDocRefs`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `andreasDocRefs`
#### Description
A constant array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document with its S3 storage information and FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a constant)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| andreasDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of DataEntry objects |

#### Internal Logic
The array contains six `DataEntry` objects, each with the following structure:
1. `s3Info`: Contains the S3 bucket name and the key (filename) of the document.
2. `docRef`: A FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
   - `resourceType`: Always set to "DocumentReference"
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document
   - `content`: An array with one object containing:
     - `attachment`: Information about the document, including title, URL, and content type

The documents represented include XML, PDF, and TIFF file types.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (imported in the related file) |

## Configuration
The `bucket` value is imported from a related file, which appears to use a configuration system to set the S3 bucket name for sandbox seed data.

## Notes
1. All documents use the same URL "http://api.metriport.com" in their attachment information.
2. The `id` fields appear to be randomly generated UUIDs.
3. The file seems to be part of a larger system for managing medical documents, possibly in a sandbox or testing environment.
4. The naming convention (andreas1, andreas11, etc.) suggests these might be test documents for a specific user or scenario.

This file plays a role in setting up test or sample data for a system that handles medical documents, utilizing both S3 for storage and FHIR standards for document referencing.
