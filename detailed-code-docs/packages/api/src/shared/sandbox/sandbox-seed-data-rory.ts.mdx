## High-level description
This file defines a constant array `roryDocRefs` containing seed data for document references. Each entry in the array represents a document with its S3 storage information and corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The file imports necessary types and constants from a related file (`sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts`) and defines a single exported constant `roryDocRefs`.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults".

## Symbols

### `roryDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects, each representing a document with its S3 storage information and FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a constant)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| roryDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of document reference entries |

#### Internal Logic
Each entry in the `roryDocRefs` array follows this structure:
1. `s3Info`: Contains the S3 bucket name and the key (filename) of the document.
2. `docRef`: A FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
   - `resourceType`: Always set to "DocumentReference"
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the document
   - `content`: An array with a single object containing:
     - `attachment`: Object with `title`, `url`, and `contentType` of the document

The array includes 6 document entries with different file types (XML, PDF, and TIF).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (imported in the related file) |

## Configuration
The `bucket` constant is imported from `sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts`, which appears to use a configuration value for the S3 bucket name.

## Notes
1. All document URLs are set to "http://api.metriport.com", which might be a placeholder or default value.
2. The document IDs appear to be randomly generated strings, possibly UUIDs.
3. The file types included are XML, PDF, and TIF (TIFF image format).
4. This seed data is likely used for testing or development purposes in a sandbox environment.
