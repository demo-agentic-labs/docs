## High-level description
This file defines a set of sample document references for a user named Emilia in a sandbox environment. It exports an array of data entries, each containing information about a document's storage in S3 and its corresponding FHIR DocumentReference resource.

## Code Structure
The file imports necessary types and constants from a related file and defines a single exported constant `emiliaDocRefs` which is an array of `DataEntry` objects.

## References
- `bucket` and `DataEntry` are imported from "./sandbox-seed-data-defaults.ts"

## Symbols

### `emiliaDocRefs`
#### Description
An array of `DataEntry` objects representing document references for Emilia in the sandbox environment.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| emiliaDocRefs | DataEntry[] | An array of data entries for Emilia's documents |

#### Internal Logic
The array contains five `DataEntry` objects, each representing a different document. Each entry includes:
1. S3 storage information (bucket and key)
2. A FHIR DocumentReference resource with:
   - A unique ID
   - Content information including title, URL, and content type

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Likely used for FHIR type definitions (implied from the related file) |

## Configuration
The `bucket` constant is imported from a configuration file, suggesting that the S3 bucket name can be configured externally.

## Notes
1. All documents use the same URL ("http://api.metriport.com") in their content attachment, which might be a placeholder or a base URL for document retrieval.
2. The document IDs appear to be base64 encoded strings, following a specific pattern.
3. The documents include various file types: XML, PDF, and PNG, demonstrating support for different content types.
4. This data is likely used for testing or demonstration purposes in a sandbox environment.
