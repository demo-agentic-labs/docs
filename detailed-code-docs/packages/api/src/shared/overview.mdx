## High-level description
This shared directory contains utility functions, constants, and types used throughout the Metriport API. It provides a wide range of functionality, including date manipulation, error handling, logging, HTTP utilities, configuration management, and data processing. The code in this directory serves as a foundation for many other parts of the API, offering reusable and standardized tools for common operations.

## What does it do?
The shared directory provides several key functionalities:

1. Error handling and logging: It offers utilities for converting errors to strings, capturing errors, and sending notifications or alerts.

2. Date and time manipulation: Functions for formatting, parsing, and validating dates and times are provided, often using the dayjs library.

3. HTTP utilities: It includes functions for checking HTTP status codes, extracting ETags, and handling Axios errors.

4. Configuration management: The `Config` class provides methods to access various environment variables and configuration settings.

5. Data processing: Utilities for filtering, mapping, and transforming data are available, including functions for working with arrays and objects.

6. Sandbox data management: It contains code for managing sandbox seed data, which is useful for testing and development purposes.

7. Type utilities: It provides TypeScript utility types for expanding complex types, which can be helpful during development.

8. Miscellaneous utilities: Various other helper functions for tasks like sleep, unit conversion, and stream processing are included.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `config.ts`: Provides the `Config` class for accessing configuration settings.
2. `util.ts`: Contains the `Util` class with various utility methods.
3. `log.ts`: Offers functions for error handling and logging.
4. `http.ts`: Provides HTTP-related utility functions.
5. `sandbox-seed-data.ts`: Main file for managing sandbox seed data.

These files are likely to be imported and used frequently throughout the rest of the API codebase.

## Key Files
1. `config.ts`: Central configuration module for the API.
2. `util.ts`: Contains a wide range of utility functions used throughout the API.
3. `log.ts`: Provides error handling and logging utilities.
4. `http.ts`: Contains HTTP-related utility functions.
5. `date.ts`: Offers date and time manipulation functions.
6. `sandbox-seed-data.ts`: Manages sandbox seed data for testing and development.
7. `constants.ts`: Defines various constants used across the API.

## Dependencies
The shared directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. dayjs: Used for date and time manipulation.
2. zod: Used for schema validation.
3. @faker-js/faker: Used for generating random test data.
4. @metriport/core: Provides various core functionalities and types.
5. express: Used for HTTP request and response types.
6. axios: Used for HTTP error handling.
7. lodash: Used for various utility functions.
8. @sentry/node: Used for error capturing and monitoring.

## Configuration
The `config.ts` file serves as the central configuration module for the API. It uses environment variables to manage various settings, including database credentials, API URLs, and authentication tokens. The `Config` class provides static methods to access these configuration settings throughout the application.

In summary, the shared directory provides a robust set of utilities and configurations that form the foundation of the Metriport API. It offers standardized ways to handle common operations, manage configurations, and process data, which helps maintain consistency and reduce code duplication across the application.
