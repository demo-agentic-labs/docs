Here's a high-level description of the `config.ts` file:

The `config.ts` file is a central configuration module for the Metriport API. It exports a `Config` class that provides static methods to access various environment variables and configuration settings. These settings include database credentials, API URLs, authentication tokens, and other environment-specific configurations. The file also includes utility functions for retrieving and parsing environment variables.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are:

1. `Config` class: Contains static methods to access various configuration settings.
2. `getEnvVar` and `getEnvVarOrFail` functions: Utility functions to retrieve environment variables.
3. Various static properties and methods within the `Config` class: Represent different configuration settings.

## Symbols

### Config

#### Description
A static class that provides methods to access various configuration settings for the Metriport API.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `getEnvVar` and `getEnvVarOrFail` to retrieve environment variables.
- Provides methods to check the current environment type (production, sandbox, staging, development).
- Offers methods to get various configuration values such as API URLs, database credentials, and authentication tokens.

- "@metriport/core/util/env-var"

## Error Handling
The `getEnvVarOrFail` function throws an error if the requested environment variable is not set or is an empty string.

This configuration file serves as a central point for managing environment-specific settings and provides a consistent interface for accessing these settings throughout the application.
