## High-level description
The `packages/api/src/sequelize` directory contains code for managing database migrations and interactions using Sequelize ORM in the API component of the project. It includes a command-line interface for running migrations, utility functions for managing the migration process, and a collection of migration scripts that define the evolution of the database schema over time.

## What does it do?
This directory provides functionality to:

1. Initialize and manage database connections using Sequelize.
2. Execute database migrations through a command-line interface.
3. Define and apply changes to the database schema, including creating new tables, modifying existing ones, adding indexes, and implementing data transformations.
4. Handle migration errors and provide rollback capabilities.
5. Offer utility functions for creating tables with default columns and triggers.
6. Manage the evolution of various entities in the database, such as users, organizations, facilities, and patients.

The code allows developers to maintain and update the database schema in a controlled and versioned manner, ensuring consistency across different environments and facilitating collaborative development.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `cli.ts`: Provides a command-line interface for running database migrations. It reads database credentials from environment variables, initializes a Sequelize instance, and executes Umzug commands based on user input.

2. `index.ts`: Exports functions for managing the migration process, including `getUmzug` for retrieving an Umzug instance and `updateDB` for executing pending migrations.

3. `migrations/`: This directory contains individual migration scripts that define specific changes to the database schema. Each script typically has an `up` function to apply changes and a `down` function to revert them.

4. `migrations-shared.ts`: Provides utility functions and a base model definition for creating tables with default columns and triggers.

The flow of control typically starts from the CLI, which uses the functions in `index.ts` to manage the migration process. The migration process then executes the individual scripts in the `migrations/` directory, utilizing the utility functions from `migrations-shared.ts` as needed.

## Key Files
1. `cli.ts`: The command-line interface for running migrations.
2. `index.ts`: Contains core functions for managing the migration process.
3. `migrations-shared.ts`: Provides utility functions for creating tables and defining common columns.
4. `migrations/*.ts`: Individual migration scripts defining specific schema changes.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily depends on:

1. Sequelize (^6.32.1): An ORM for Node.js, used for defining models and interacting with the database.
2. Umzug: A migration framework for Node.js, used in conjunction with Sequelize to manage the execution of migrations.
3. dotenv: Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
4. @metriport/core: A local package that provides utility functions and shared types.
5. @metriport/shared/config: Provides configuration settings for the project.

## Configuration
The migration process relies on several configuration elements:

1. Database Credentials: Stored in the `DB_CREDS` environment variable as a JSON string containing `dbname`, `username`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `engine`.
2. Migration File Path: Determined based on the environment using the `Config` class from `@metriport/shared/config`.
3. Sequelize Configuration: Likely defined in a separate configuration file (not shown in the provided code snippets) that specifies database connection details and other Sequelize options.

The `cli.ts` file reads these configurations to set up the database connection and run migrations, while individual migration scripts use the Sequelize configuration to define and apply schema changes.
