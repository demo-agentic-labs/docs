## High-level description
The code defines a function `updateDB` that manages database migrations using the `umzug` library. It retrieves pending migrations, executes them, and handles potential errors by rolling back to the last executed migration if necessary. The code also exports a `getUmzug` function to retrieve an instance of the `Umzug` class, which is responsible for managing the migration process.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `getUmzug` and `updateDB`. `getUmzug` is a factory function that creates and returns an instance of the `Umzug` class, responsible for managing migrations. `updateDB` uses the `Umzug` instance to retrieve and execute pending migrations, and handles potential errors.

## References
- `Config`: Used to determine the path for migration files based on the environment.
- `MetriportError`: Custom error class used for throwing errors during the migration process.

## Symbols

### `getUmzug`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an instance of the `Umzug` class, which is responsible for managing database migrations. It uses the `SequelizeStorage` to store migration metadata in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequelize | Sequelize | An instance of the Sequelize object, representing the database connection. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| umzug | Umzug&lt;QueryInterface&gt; | An instance of the Umzug class, configured with the provided Sequelize instance. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if an `umzug` instance already exists. If so, returns the existing instance.
2. Creates a new `Umzug` instance, configuring it with:
    - `migrations`: Uses a glob pattern to load migration files from the specified path.
    - `context`: Sets the context to the Sequelize QueryInterface, allowing migrations to interact with the database.
    - `storage`: Uses `SequelizeStorage` to store migration metadata in the database.
    - `logger`: Sets the logger to the console.
3. Returns the created `umzug` instance.

### `getUmzugWithMeta`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves an instance of the `Umzug` class along with metadata about the migrations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequelize | Sequelize | An instance of the Sequelize object, representing the database connection. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | object | An object containing the following properties:
    - `umzug`: An instance of the Umzug class.
    - `migrations`: The total number of migrations.
    - `executed`: The number of executed migrations.
    - `pending`: The number of pending migrations.
    - `lastExecuted`: The name of the last executed migration.
    - `rollbackTo`: The name of the migration to rollback to, if any. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the QueryInterface from the Sequelize instance.
2. Calls `getUmzug` to get the Umzug instance.
3. Uses the Umzug instance to retrieve:
    - All migrations.
    - Executed migrations.
    - Pending migrations.
4. Constructs and returns an object containing the Umzug instance and the retrieved migration metadata.

### `updateDB`
#### Description
This asynchronous function updates the database schema by running pending migrations. It uses the `Umzug` instance to execute migrations and handles potential errors by attempting to roll back to the last executed migration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequelize | Sequelize | An instance of the Sequelize object, representing the database connection. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| migrations | MigrationMeta[] | An array of metadata objects for the executed migrations. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the Umzug instance and migration metadata using `getUmzugWithMeta`.
2. Logs information about the migrations.
3. Executes all pending migrations using `umzug.up()`.
4. If an error occurs during migration:
    - Logs an error message.
    - Attempts to roll back to the last executed migration using `umzug.down({ to: rollbackTo })`.
    - If rollback fails, throws a `MetriportError` with details about the original and rollback errors.
    - If rollback succeeds, throws the original error.
5. If all migrations are executed successfully, returns the metadata of the executed migrations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | Provides the `MetriportError` custom error class. |
| @metriport/shared/config | Provides the `Config` class for accessing configuration settings. |
| sequelize | Sequelize ORM for interacting with the database. |
| umzug | Migration library for managing database schema changes. |

## Error Handling
The `updateDB` function implements error handling by catching potential errors during the migration process. If an error occurs, it attempts to roll back to the last executed migration. If the rollback fails, it throws a `MetriportError` with details about the original and rollback errors.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` to log information about the migrations, including the number of executed, pending, and total migrations. It also logs errors encountered during the migration process.
