## High-level description
This code defines database migration scripts for creating and dropping a `change_log` table and its associated trigger function `change_trigger`. The `change_log` table is designed to track changes (insert, update, delete) made to other tables in the database.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `up` for upgrading the database schema and `down` for reverting the upgrade. Both functions use transactions to ensure atomicity. The `up` function creates the `change_log` table and the `change_trigger` function. The `down` function drops the trigger function and then the table.

## References
This code references the `shared` module, specifically the `createTable` function and `updateUpdatedAtFnName` constant.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function defines the steps to upgrade the database schema by creating the `change_log` table and the `change_trigger` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the queryInterface object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Calls the `createTable` function from the `shared` module to create the `change_log` table with the specified columns.
3. Executes a raw SQL query to create the `change_trigger` function, which logs changes (insert, update, delete) made to other tables.
4. Commits the transaction.

### `down`
#### Description
This function defines the steps to revert the database schema changes made by the `up` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the queryInterface object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Drops the `change_trigger` function.
3. Drops the `change_log` table.
4. Commits the transaction.

### `getChangeTriggerCreateCmd`
#### Description
This function generates the SQL command to create or replace the `change_trigger` function. This trigger function is responsible for logging changes (insert, update, delete) made to other tables in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None |  |  |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The SQL command to create or replace the `change_trigger` function. |

#### Internal Logic
The function constructs a string containing the SQL command. The command defines a function named `change_trigger` that gets executed on insert, update, and delete operations on tables where it's applied. The function logs the operation type, timestamp, user, and old and new values in the `change_log` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides database interaction and migration functionalities. |
| umzug | A migration framework for Node.js. |
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | Custom error class from the Metriport project. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure that schema changes are applied or rolled back atomically. If an error occurs during the `up` migration, the code attempts to roll back to the last successful migration. If an error occurs during the rollback, it's caught and re-thrown with additional context.
