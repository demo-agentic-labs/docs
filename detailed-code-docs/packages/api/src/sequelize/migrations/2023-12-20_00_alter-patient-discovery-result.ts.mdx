## High-level description
This migration script adds and removes an index on the `request_id` column of the `patient_discovery_result` table. This is likely done to improve the performance of queries that filter or join on this column. 

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration. It adds an index to the `request_id` column in the `patient_discovery_result` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | Object | An object containing the queryInterface, which provides access to Sequelize methods for database interactions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Transaction:** The migration is wrapped in a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. **Add Index:** The `addIndex` method is called on the `queryInterface` object to create the index on the `request_id` column of the `patient_discovery_result` table.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration. It removes the index that was added by the `up` migration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | Object | An object containing the queryInterface, which provides access to Sequelize methods for database interactions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Transaction:** The rollback is wrapped in a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. **Remove Index:** The `removeIndex` method is called on the `queryInterface` object to drop the index on the `request_id` column of the `patient_discovery_result` table.
