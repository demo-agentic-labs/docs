---

## High-level description
This code defines a database migration script using Sequelize. It creates a table named "cq_patient_data" to store patient data associated with a "cxId". The table includes columns for an automatically generated ID, the "cxId", and a JSONB column for storing the actual patient data.

## References
- `shared`: This migration script references the `createTable` function from the `migrations-shared.ts` file to create the table with default columns and triggers.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the actions to perform when applying the migration. It creates the "cq_patient_data" table within a database transaction.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | object | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is successfully applied. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Begins a database transaction:** Ensures that all operations within the transaction are executed successfully or rolled back in case of an error.
2. **Calls `shared.createTable`:** Utilizes the `createTable` function from `migrations-shared.ts` to create the "cq_patient_data" table.
   - Passes the `queryInterface`, table name (`tableName`), column definitions, and options to the `createTable` function.
   - The column definitions specify an `id` (string, primary key), `cxId` (string, not null), and `data` (JSONB, not null).
   - The options include `transaction` to execute within the current transaction and `addVersion` to include a version column for tracking changes.
3. **Commits the transaction:** If all operations within the transaction are successful, the changes are committed to the database.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the actions to perform when rolling back the migration. It drops the "cq_patient_data" table within a database transaction.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | object | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is successfully completed. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Begins a database transaction:** Ensures that all operations within the transaction are executed successfully or rolled back in case of an error.
2. **Drops the "cq_patient_data" table:** Uses `queryInterface.dropTable` to remove the table from the database.
   - Passes the `tableName` and `transaction` object to ensure the operation is part of the transaction.
3. **Commits the transaction:** If the table is successfully dropped, the changes are committed to the database.

## Dependencies
- **sequelize**: Used for database interactions and defining data types.

## Error Handling
- The code utilizes database transactions to ensure atomicity. If any operation within the `up` or `down` functions fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, preventing partial database changes.
