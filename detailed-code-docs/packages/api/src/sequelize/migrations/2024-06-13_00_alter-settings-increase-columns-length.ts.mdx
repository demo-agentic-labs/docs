## High-level description
This migration script alters the `settings` table in the database, specifically increasing the length of the `webhook_url` and `webhook_status_detail` columns to 2048 characters. It provides both `up` and `down` functions to apply and revert the migration respectively.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration, increasing the length of the `webhook_url` and `webhook_status_detail` columns in the `settings` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | Object | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Uses `queryInterface.changeColumn` to modify the `webhook_url` column:
    - Sets the data type to `DataTypes.STRING(2048)`, allowing up to 2048 characters.
    - Sets `allowNull` to `true`, permitting null values.
3. Similarly, modifies the `webhook_status_detail` column with the same data type and nullability.
4. Commits the transaction if all changes are successful.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration, restoring the original length of the `webhook_url` and `webhook_status_detail` columns in the `settings` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | Object | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Uses `queryInterface.changeColumn` to revert the `webhook_status_detail` column:
    - Sets the data type back to `DataTypes.STRING`, using the default length.
    - Sets `allowNull` to `true`, maintaining the existing nullability.
3. Similarly, reverts the `webhook_url` column with the same data type and nullability.
4. Commits the transaction if all changes are successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides database interaction and migration functionality. |
| DataTypes (from sequelize) | Used to define data types for database columns. |

## Error Handling
The code implicitly relies on the database transaction mechanism for error handling. If any of the `queryInterface.changeColumn` calls fail, the transaction will be rolled back, preventing partial changes to the database schema.
