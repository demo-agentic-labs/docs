## High-level description
This migration script adds a new `version` column to multiple tables in the database. The column is an integer, defaults to 0, and is not allowed to be null.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `up` and `down`. Both functions use a transaction to ensure atomicity. 
- `up` adds the `version` column to the specified tables.
- `down` removes the `version` column from the specified tables.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function is executed when running database migrations and is responsible for adding the `version` column to the database tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the queryInterface object, which provides access to Sequelize's query building methods. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;unknown&gt; | Promise&lt;unknown&gt; | A promise that resolves when all the `addColumn` operations are complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Uses `Promise.all` to execute the `addColumn` operation on multiple tables concurrently.
3. For each table (`connected_user`, `settings`, `webhook_request`, `mapi_access`, `organization`, `facility`, `patient`), it adds a column named `version` with the predefined `columnDef`.
4. The transaction is committed if all `addColumn` operations are successful. If any of them fail, the transaction is rolled back.

### `down`
#### Description
This function is executed when rolling back database migrations and is responsible for removing the `version` column from the database tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the queryInterface object, which provides access to Sequelize's query building methods. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;unknown&gt; | Promise&lt;unknown&gt; | A promise that resolves when all the `removeColumn` operations are complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Uses `Promise.all` to execute the `removeColumn` operation on multiple tables concurrently.
3. For each table (`patient`, `facility`, `organization`, `mapi_access`, `webhook_request`, `settings`, `connected_user`), it removes the column named `version`.
4. The transaction is committed if all `removeColumn` operations are successful. If any of them fail, the transaction is rolled back.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides the ORM and database interaction functionalities. |
| umzug |  A migration framework for Node.js that helps manage database schema changes. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to handle potential errors during the migration process. If any of the `addColumn` or `removeColumn` operations fail, the entire transaction is rolled back, preventing the database from ending up in an inconsistent state.
