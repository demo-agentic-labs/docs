## High-level description
This migration script adds a new column named "raw" to the "document_reference" table in the database. The "raw" column is of type JSONB and allows null values. The `down` function reverts this change by removing the "raw" column.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration. It adds a new column named "raw" to the "document_reference" table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | object | An object containing the queryInterface, which provides access to Sequelize methods for database interactions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. Adds a new column "raw" to the "document_reference" table using `queryInterface.addColumn`.
   - The column is of type JSONB (`DataTypes.JSONB`).
   - The column allows null values (`allowNull: true`).
   - The operation is executed within the transaction.
3. Commits the transaction implicitly by resolving the promise returned by `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration. It removes the "raw" column from the "document_reference" table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | object | An object containing the queryInterface, which provides access to Sequelize methods for database interactions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. Removes the "raw" column from the "document_reference" table using `queryInterface.removeColumn`.
   - The operation is executed within the transaction.
3. Commits the transaction implicitly by resolving the promise returned by `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides the ORM and migration framework. |
| DataTypes (from "sequelize") | Used to specify the data type of the new column. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure that either all changes are applied or none are. If any error occurs during the `up` or `down` migration, the transaction will be rolled back, preventing partial database changes.
