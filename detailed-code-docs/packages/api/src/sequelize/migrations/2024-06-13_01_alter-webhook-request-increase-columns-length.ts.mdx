## High-level description
This migration script increases the length of the `request_url` and `status_detail` columns in the `webhook_request` table. It provides both `up` and `down` functions to apply and revert the changes respectively.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function increases the length of the `request_url` and `status_detail` columns in the `webhook_request` table to 2048 characters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | object | An object containing the queryInterface object, which provides access to Sequelize's query methods. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a transaction to ensure both column alterations are executed together.
2. Uses `queryInterface.changeColumn` to modify the `request_url` column:
    - Sets the data type to `DataTypes.STRING(2048)`, allowing up to 2048 characters.
    - Sets `allowNull` to `true`, permitting null values.
3. Similarly, modifies the `status_detail` column with the same data type and `allowNull` setting.
4. Commits the transaction if both column alterations are successful.

### `down`
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the `up` function, restoring the original length of the `request_url` and `status_detail` columns.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | object | An object containing the queryInterface object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a transaction to ensure both column alterations are executed together.
2. Uses `queryInterface.changeColumn` to revert the `status_detail` column:
    - Sets the data type back to `DataTypes.STRING`, using the default length.
    - Sets `allowNull` to `true`, maintaining the previous setting.
3. Similarly, reverts the `request_url` column with the same data type and `allowNull` setting.
4. Commits the transaction if both column alterations are successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides database interaction using Sequelize ORM. |
| umzug | Handles database migrations. |

## Error Handling
The code uses transactions to ensure atomicity of operations. If any of the column alterations fail, the transaction will be rolled back, preventing partial updates to the database schema.
