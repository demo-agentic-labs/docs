## High-level description
This migration script removes the primary key column `id` from the `change_log` table. It provides both `up` and `down` functions to apply and revert the migration, respectively.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration, which involves removing the `id` column from the `change_log` table. It uses a transaction to ensure atomicity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is applied successfully. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. Removes the `id` column from the `change_log` table using `queryInterface.removeColumn` within the transaction.
3. Implicitly commits the transaction if all operations succeed.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration, which involves adding back the `id` column to the `change_log` table. It also uses a transaction for atomicity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is reverted successfully. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Adds the `id` column back to the `change_log` table using `queryInterface.addColumn` within the transaction. The column is defined as a `BIGINT` primary key with auto-increment.
3. Implicitly commits the transaction if all operations succeed.

## References
- `DataTypes` from `sequelize`: Used to specify the data type of the `id` column.
- `Migration` from "..": This likely refers to a type definition for migration functions, probably imported from a local module.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
