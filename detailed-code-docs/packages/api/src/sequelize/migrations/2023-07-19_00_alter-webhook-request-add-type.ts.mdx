## High-level description
This code defines a database migration using the `umzug` library. The migration adds a new column named "type" to the "webhook_request" table. It also provides a rollback function to revert this change.

## References
- `DataTypes` from `sequelize` library.
- `Migration` type from local files.

## Symbols
### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to execute the migration. It adds a new column named "type" of type `STRING` to the "webhook_request" table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the queryInterface, which provides access to Sequelize's query building methods. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Uses `queryInterface.addColumn` to add the "type" column to the "webhook_request" table.
3. Commits the transaction.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to rollback the migration. It removes the "type" column from the "webhook_request" table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the queryInterface, which provides access to Sequelize's query building methods. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Uses `queryInterface.removeColumn` to remove the "type" column from the "webhook_request" table.
3. Commits the transaction.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides database interaction functionalities. |
| umzug     | Provides database migration management. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure that either all migration steps are applied or none are. This prevents partial migrations in case of errors.
