## High-level description
This code defines a database migration script for creating a table named `docref_mapping`. This table likely stores mappings between internal document references and external identifiers from different data sources. 

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `up` and `down`. The `up` function handles the database migration to create the table and its associated indexes. The `down` function handles the rollback by dropping the table. Both functions use transactions to ensure atomicity.

## References
- `shared.createTable`: This function is imported from `../migrations-shared` and is responsible for creating the table with common default columns and triggers.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to create the `docref_mapping` table and its indexes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | \{ queryInterface: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Calls the `shared.createTable` function to create the `docref_mapping` table with the specified columns:
    - `id`: A string primary key.
    - `externalId`: A string representing the external document identifier.
    - `cxId`: A UUID representing an internal identifier.
    - `patientId`: A string representing the patient identifier.
    - `source`: A string indicating the source of the document reference.
3. Defines a unique constraint named `external_unique` on the combination of `external_id`, `patient_id`, `cx_id`, and `source` columns.
4. Creates an index named `docref_mapping_alternative_unique_idx` on the `cx_id`, `patient_id`, and `source` columns.
5. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to rollback the migration by dropping the `docref_mapping` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | \{ queryInterface: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Calls `queryInterface.dropTable` to drop the `docref_mapping` table.
3. Commits the transaction if the table is successfully dropped.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | ORM for interacting with the database. |
| ../migrations-shared | Provides shared functions for database migrations. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure that either all operations within the `up` and `down` functions are successful or the entire transaction is rolled back. This prevents the database from being left in an inconsistent state if an error occurs during the migration.
