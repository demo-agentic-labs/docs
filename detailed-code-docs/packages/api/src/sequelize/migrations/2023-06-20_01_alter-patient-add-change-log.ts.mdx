## High-level description
This code defines a database migration script that adds a trigger named `change_log` to the `patient` table. This trigger is designed to execute a stored procedure called `change_trigger` whenever an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation occurs on the `patient` table.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function defines the actions to be performed when applying the migration (moving the database schema up). It creates a trigger named `change_log` on the `patient` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Executes a raw SQL query to create the `change_log` trigger. The trigger is defined to execute the `change_trigger` stored procedure after INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on the `patient` table.
3. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful.

### `down`
#### Description
This function defines the actions to be performed when reverting the migration (moving the database schema down). It drops the `change_log` trigger from the `patient` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Executes the `dropTrigger` method of the `queryInterface` to drop the `change_log` trigger from the `patient` table.
3. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful.

## References
- `Migration` type is imported from a local file and defines the structure of migration functions.
- `queryInterface` object is provided by the Umzug library and is used to interact with the database schema.

## Dependencies
- `umzug`: A migration library used to manage database schema changes.

## Error Handling
The migration script uses database transactions to ensure that the `up` and `down` operations are atomic. If any error occurs during the execution of either function, the transaction will be rolled back, leaving the database in a consistent state.
