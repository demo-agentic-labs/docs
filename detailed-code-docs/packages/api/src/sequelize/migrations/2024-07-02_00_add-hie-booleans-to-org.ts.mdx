## High-level description
This migration script adds two new boolean columns, `cq_active` and `cw_active`, to the `organization` table in the database. These columns likely indicate whether certain features (CQ and CW) are active for a given organization.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration, adding the `cq_active` and `cw_active` columns to the `organization` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Start a transaction:** It begins a database transaction to ensure both column additions are atomic.
2. **Add `cq_active` column:** It uses `queryInterface.addColumn` to add the `cq_active` column to the `organization` table. The column is defined as a `BOOLEAN` with a default value of `false` and is not nullable.
3. **Add `cw_active` column:** Similarly, it adds the `cw_active` column with the same data type, default value, and nullability constraints.
4. **Commit transaction:** The transaction is implicitly committed if all operations within it succeed.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration, removing the `cq_active` and `cw_active` columns from the `organization` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Start a transaction:** It begins a database transaction to ensure both column removals are atomic.
2. **Remove `cw_active` column:** It uses `queryInterface.removeColumn` to remove the `cw_active` column from the `organization` table.
3. **Remove `cq_active` column:** Similarly, it removes the `cq_active` column.
4. **Commit transaction:** The transaction is implicitly committed if all operations within it succeed.
