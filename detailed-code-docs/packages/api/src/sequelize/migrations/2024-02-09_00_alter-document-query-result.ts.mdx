## High-level description
This migration script adds an index to the `request_id` column in the `document_query_result` table. This is likely done to improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by `request_id`.

## References
- This migration script uses the `Migration` type from a local file.
- It also uses the `queryInterface` object, which is provided by the Umzug library and allows interacting with the database schema.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration. It starts a database transaction and adds an index to the `request_id` column in the `document_query_result` table within that transaction.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} |  \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the queryInterface object, which is an instance of Sequelize's QueryInterface. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (implicit) | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is applied successfully. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Begin Transaction:** It starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. **Add Index:** It adds an index to the `request_id` column of the `document_query_result` table using `queryInterface.addIndex`. The index is created within the transaction.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration. It starts a database transaction and removes the index from the `request_id` column in the `document_query_result` table within that transaction.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the queryInterface object, which is an instance of Sequelize's QueryInterface. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (implicit) | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is reverted successfully. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Begin Transaction:** It starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. **Remove Index:** It removes the index from the `request_id` column of the `document_query_result` table using `queryInterface.removeIndex`. The index is removed within the transaction.


## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Migration (local) | Provides the type definition for migration functions. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure that both `up` and `down` operations are executed atomically. If any error occurs during the execution of either function, the transaction will be rolled back, preventing partial updates to the database schema.
