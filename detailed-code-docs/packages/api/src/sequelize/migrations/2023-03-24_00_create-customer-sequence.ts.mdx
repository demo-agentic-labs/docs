## High-level description
This migration script sets up a database table named `customer_sequence` to manage unique, sequential IDs for organizations, facilities, and patients. It ensures existing organizations, facilities, and patients have corresponding entries in the `customer_sequence` table with the correct next sequence number.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `up` and `down`. The `up` function is responsible for creating the `customer_sequence` table and populating it with initial data. It uses helper functions `getCxIDs`, `getMaxSeq`, and `getSeq` to retrieve existing customer IDs and calculate the next sequence number. The `down` function simply drops the `customer_sequence` table.

## References
- `Config.getSystemRootOID()`: This function is referenced to retrieve the system's root OID. It's defined in the `Config` class from the `../../shared/config` module.

## Symbols
### `up`
#### Description
This function is an asynchronous migration function that creates the `customer_sequence` table and populates it with initial data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queryInterface | Sequelize.QueryInterface | An object that provides access to Sequelize's query interface for database operations. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Creates the `customer_sequence` table with columns for ID, data type, and sequence number.
3. Iterates through each data type (organization, facility, patient).
4. For each data type, retrieves existing customer IDs using the `getCxIDs` function.
5. For each customer ID, retrieves the maximum existing sequence number using the `getMaxSeq` function.
6. Calculates the next sequence number based on the maximum existing sequence number.
7. Inserts a new row into the `customer_sequence` table with the customer ID, data type, and next sequence number.
8. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful.

### `down`
#### Description
This function is an asynchronous migration function that reverts the changes made by the `up` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queryInterface | Sequelize.QueryInterface | An object that provides access to Sequelize's query interface for database operations. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Drops the `customer_sequence` table.
3. Commits the transaction if the table is successfully dropped.

### `getCxIDs`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves a list of distinct customer IDs for a given data type from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequelize | Sequelize.Sequelize | A Sequelize instance representing the database connection. |
| dataType | DataType | The type of data to retrieve customer IDs for (organization, facility, or patient). |
| transaction | Sequelize.Transaction | An ongoing database transaction. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;string[]&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves with an array of customer IDs. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SQL query to retrieve distinct customer IDs from the `organization` and `connected_user` tables, excluding those already present in the `customer_sequence` table for the given data type.
2. Returns an empty array if no results are found, otherwise returns an array of customer IDs extracted from the query result.

### `getMaxSeq`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves the maximum existing sequence number for a given customer ID and data type from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequelize | Sequelize.Sequelize | A Sequelize instance representing the database connection. |
| cxId | string | The customer ID to retrieve the maximum sequence number for. |
| dataType | DataType | The type of data to retrieve the maximum sequence number for (organization, facility, or patient). |
| transaction | Sequelize.Transaction | An ongoing database transaction. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;string&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves with the maximum sequence number as a string, or undefined if no matching records are found. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the appropriate table name and whether to filter by customer ID based on the provided data type.
2. Executes a SQL query to retrieve the maximum ID from the determined table, optionally filtering by customer ID.
3. Returns undefined if no results are found, otherwise returns the maximum ID extracted from the query result.

### `getSeq`
#### Description
This function extracts the sequence number from a given ID string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string \| undefined | The ID string to extract the sequence number from. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| number \| undefined | number \| undefined | The extracted sequence number as a number, or undefined if the ID string is invalid or does not contain a sequence number. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns undefined if the ID string is undefined.
2. Splits the ID string by ".".
3. Returns undefined if the split result is invalid or empty.
4. Parses the last element of the split result as a number and returns it as the sequence number.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides database interaction capabilities. |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `OID_ID_START` | number | 100 | The starting value for the sequence number. |

## Error Handling
The `getMaxSeq` function throws an error if an invalid data type is provided.

## Side Effects
This script modifies the database schema by creating and populating the `customer_sequence` table. It also reads data from the `organization`, `connected_user`, `facility`, and `patient` tables.
