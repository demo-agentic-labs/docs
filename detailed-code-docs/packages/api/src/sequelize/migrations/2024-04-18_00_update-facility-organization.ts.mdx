## High-level description
This migration script updates the `facility` and `organization` tables in the database. It adds several new columns to the `facility` table related to organization identifiers and types, and adds a `type` column to the `organization` table. It also updates existing facilities with generated OIDs and facility numbers based on their associated organization.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `up` and `down`. 
* `up` is responsible for applying the migration, adding new columns and updating existing data. 
* `down` is responsible for reverting the migration, removing the added columns. 

Both functions use a database transaction to ensure that all changes are applied or reverted atomically.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function applies the migration, adding new columns to the `facility` and `organization` tables and updating existing data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Adds new columns to the `facility` table: `oid`, `facility_number`, `cq_obo_active`, `cw_obo_active`, `cq_obo_oid`, `cw_obo_oid`, and `type`.
3. Adds a new column `type` to the `organization` table.
4. Queries all organizations from the `organization` table.
5. For each organization:
    - Queries all facilities associated with the organization using `cx_id`.
    - For each facility:
        - Generates a facility OID based on the organization number and a counter.
        - Updates the facility record with the generated OID and a facility number.
6. Commits the transaction.

### `down`
#### Description
This function reverts the migration, removing the added columns from the `facility` and `organization` tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Removes the added columns from the `facility` table in reverse order of their addition in the `up` function.
3. Removes the `type` column from the `organization` table.
4. Commits the transaction.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | ORM for interacting with the database. |
| umzug | Migration framework for managing database schema changes. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure atomicity of the migration steps. If any error occurs during the `up` or `down` functions, the transaction is rolled back, reverting any changes made to the database.
