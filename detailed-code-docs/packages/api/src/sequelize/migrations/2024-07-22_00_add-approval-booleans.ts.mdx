## High-level description
This migration script adds two new boolean columns, `cq_approved` and `cw_approved`, to both the `organization` and `facility` tables in the database. These columns likely represent different types of approvals (CQ and CW) and default to `false`.

## References
- This code depends on the `Migration` type imported from a local file.
- It also uses the `DataTypes` enum from the `sequelize` library.

## Symbols
### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration, adding the new columns to the tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is successfully applied. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Uses `queryInterface.addColumn` to add the `cq_approved` and `cw_approved` columns to both the `organization` and `facility` tables.
    - The columns are defined as `BOOLEAN` type with a default value of `false` and are not nullable.
3. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration, removing the added columns from the tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is successfully reverted. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
2. Uses `queryInterface.removeColumn` to remove the `cq_approved` and `cw_approved` columns from both the `facility` and `organization` tables.
3. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides the database abstraction layer and types for defining the migration. |
| umzug |  (Indirect dependency, used in `packages/api/src/sequelize/index.ts`) Provides the migration framework for managing database schema changes. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure that either all operations within `up` and `down` functions are successful, or the entire operation is rolled back, preventing partial updates to the database schema.
