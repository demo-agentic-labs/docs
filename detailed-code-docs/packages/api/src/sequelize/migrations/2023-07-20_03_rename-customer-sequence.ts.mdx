## High-level description
This migration script renames the `customer_sequence` table to `customer_sequence_704_20230720` and vice versa. This is likely done to prevent conflicts during a database migration process.

## References
- This code references the `Migration` type from an external module, likely "umzug".
- It also uses the `queryInterface` object, which is provided by the Umzug library and allows interaction with the database.

## Symbols
### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function renames the `customer_sequence` table to `customer_sequence_704_20230720`. It performs the renaming operation within a database transaction to ensure atomicity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which is an instance of the `QueryInterface` class from the Sequelize library. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (implicit) | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the table has been renamed successfully. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. Renames the `customer_sequence` table to `customer_sequence_704_20230720` using `queryInterface.renameTable`, passing the `transaction` object to ensure the operation is part of the transaction.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function reverts the changes made by the `up` migration. It renames the `customer_sequence_704_20230720` table back to its original name, `customer_sequence`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (implicit) | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the table has been renamed successfully. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. Renames the `customer_sequence_704_20230720` table back to `customer_sequence` using `queryInterface.renameTable`, passing the `transaction` object.


## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Migration (type) | Defines the structure of a migration function. |
| queryInterface | Provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure that the renaming operations are atomic. If any error occurs during the `up` or `down` migrations, the transaction will be rolled back, preventing the database from being left in an inconsistent state.
