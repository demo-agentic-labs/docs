## High-level description
This migration script alters the `document_retrieval_result` table in the database. Specifically, it adds an index to the `request_id` column to improve query performance. The `down` function reverses this change by removing the index.

## References
- This code references the `document_retrieval_result` table. Understanding the structure and purpose of this table is crucial for understanding the impact of this migration.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration. It adds an index to the `request_id` column in the `document_retrieval_result` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | Object | An object containing the queryInterface, which provides access to database operations. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Begins a database transaction:** This ensures that the index creation is performed atomically.
2. **Adds an index:** Uses `queryInterface.addIndex` to create an index on the `request_id` column of the `document_retrieval_result` table.
3. **Commits the transaction:** If the index creation is successful, the transaction is committed, making the changes persistent.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration. It removes the index that was added to the `request_id` column in the `up` migration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | Object | An object containing the queryInterface, which provides access to database operations. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Begins a database transaction:** This ensures that the index removal is performed atomically.
2. **Removes the index:** Uses `queryInterface.removeIndex` to remove the index from the `request_id` column of the `document_retrieval_result` table.
3. **Commits the transaction:** If the index removal is successful, the transaction is committed, reverting the changes made by the `up` migration.
