## High-level description
This code defines database migrations for creating and dropping tables related to medical entities: `organization`, `facility`, and `patient`. It uses Sequelize ORM and its migration framework, Umzug, to manage database schema changes.

## Code Structure
The code exports two asynchronous functions: `up` and `down`. 
- `up` is responsible for creating the tables. 
- `down` is responsible for dropping the tables. 
Both functions use a transaction to ensure atomicity of operations. 
They utilize the `createTable` function from `migrations-shared.ts` to define and create tables with common columns and triggers.

## References
- `shared`: refers to functions and types imported from `migrations-shared.ts`, used for common table creation logic and types.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the 'up' migration, responsible for creating the `organization`, `facility`, and `patient` tables in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance, used to execute SQL queries. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when all tables are created successfully. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity of table creation.
2. Calls `shared.createTable` to create each table (`organization`, `facility`, `patient`) with their respective columns and constraints.
3. Defines unique constraints for `facility` and `patient` tables using `uniqueKeys` option.
4. Commits the transaction if all table creations are successful.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the 'down' migration, responsible for dropping the `patient`, `facility`, and `organization` tables from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance, used to execute SQL queries. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when all tables are dropped successfully. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity of table dropping.
2. Calls `queryInterface.dropTable` to drop each table in reverse order (`patient`, `facility`, `organization`).
3. Commits the transaction if all table drops are successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides the ORM and migration framework. |
| umzug     | Manages the execution of migrations. |
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | Provides custom error class for error handling. |

## Error Handling
The code uses database transactions to ensure atomicity of operations. If any error occurs during the 'up' or 'down' migration, the transaction will be rolled back, preventing partial database changes.
