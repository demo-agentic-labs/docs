## High-level description
This code defines a database migration that removes the `patient_number` column from the `patient` table. It includes both `up` and `down` functions to apply and revert the migration, respectively. This ensures that the database schema can be managed effectively during development and deployment.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to apply the migration, which in this case is removing the `patient_number` column from the `patient` table. It uses a transaction to ensure that the operation is atomic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object, which provides methods for interacting with the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is successfully applied. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. Removes the `patient_number` column from the `patient` table using `queryInterface.removeColumn`.
3. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful. If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function defines the steps to revert the migration, which in this case is adding back the `patient_number` column to the `patient` table. It also uses a transaction to ensure atomicity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the `queryInterface` object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is successfully reverted. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction using `queryInterface.sequelize.transaction`.
2. Adds the `patient_number` column back to the `patient` table using `queryInterface.addColumn`. The column is defined as an INTEGER type.
3. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful. If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides the database abstraction layer and migration utilities. |
| umzug | A migration framework used to manage database schema changes. |

## Error Handling
Both `up` and `down` functions use database transactions to ensure atomicity. If any operation within the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, preventing the database from being left in an inconsistent state.
