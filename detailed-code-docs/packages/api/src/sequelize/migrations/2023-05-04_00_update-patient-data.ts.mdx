## High-level description
This migration script updates the structure of the `data` field in the `patient` table. It specifically addresses the `address` and `contact` fields within the `data` field, ensuring they are stored as arrays, even if they previously contained a single object.

## Code Structure
The code defines two asynchronous functions, `up` and `down`, representing the forward and reverse migration steps. Both functions fetch existing patient data, modify the `address` and `contact` fields within the `data` object, and then update the database.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function performs the forward migration, converting `address` and `contact` fields within the `patient.data` object to arrays.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Fetches all records from the `patient` table.
3. Iterates through each patient record:
    - If `data.address` exists and is not an array, it converts it to an array containing the original value.
    - If `data.contact` exists, is not an array, and contains either an `email` or `phone` property, it converts it to an array containing the original object.
    - Stringifies the updated `data` object.
4. If there are any modified patient records:
    - Deletes all existing records from the `patient` table.
    - Inserts the modified patient records back into the table.
5. Commits the transaction.

### `down`
#### Description
This function performs the reverse migration, reverting the `address` and `contact` fields within the `patient.data` object back to their original structure (single object if they were not arrays before).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| \{ context: queryInterface \} | \{ context: QueryInterface \} | An object containing the Sequelize QueryInterface instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Fetches all records from the `patient` table.
3. Iterates through each patient record:
    - If `data.address` exists, is an array, and has at least one element, it sets `data.address` to the first element of the array.
    - If `data.contact` exists, is an array, and has at least one element, it sets `data.contact` to the first element of the array.
    - Stringifies the updated `data` object.
4. If there are any modified patient records:
    - Deletes all existing records from the `patient` table.
    - Inserts the modified patient records back into the table.
5. Commits the transaction.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `data` field in the `patient` table.
- Deletes and reinserts all records in the `patient` table during both the `up` and `down` migrations.

## Performance Considerations
- The migration script performs a bulk delete and bulk insert operation, which can be inefficient for large datasets. Consider alternative approaches for updating the data in place if performance is a concern.
