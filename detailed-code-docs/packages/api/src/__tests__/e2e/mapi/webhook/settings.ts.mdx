## High-level description
The `settings.ts` file defines a set of functions for handling and testing webhook requests, specifically focusing on the "ping" webhook functionality. It provides mechanisms to store, retrieve, and reset the last received ping webhook request for testing purposes.

## Code Structure
The code defines three functions: `getPingWebhookRequest`, `resetPingData`, and `handlePing`. `handlePing` processes an incoming ping webhook request, logs it, stores it for later retrieval using `getPingWebhookRequest`, and sends a response. `resetPingData` allows for resetting the stored webhook data, primarily for testing.

## Symbols

### `getPingWebhookRequest`
#### Description
Retrieves the last received ping webhook request. This is primarily used for testing purposes.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | `PingWebhookRequest | undefined` | The last received `PingWebhookRequest`, or `undefined` if none has been received yet. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply returns the value of the `webhookRequest` variable, which is where the last received ping webhook request is stored.

### `resetPingData`
#### Description
Resets the stored ping webhook request data. This is primarily used for testing purposes, to ensure a clean state between tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `value` | `PingWebhookRequest | undefined` | Optional. The value to set the `webhookRequest` to. Defaults to `undefined`. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The function sets the `webhookRequest` variable to the provided `value`, or `undefined` if no value is provided.

### `handlePing`
#### Description
Handles incoming ping webhook requests. It logs the received request, stores it for later retrieval, and sends a response with a "pong" message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `whRequest` | `PingWebhookRequest` | The incoming ping webhook request. |
| `res` | `Response` | The Express response object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | `Response` | The Express response object, with a 200 status code and a JSON body containing a "pong" message echoing the received "ping" value. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the received ping value from the `whRequest`.
2. Stores the `whRequest` in the `webhookRequest` variable.
3. Sends a 200 OK response with a JSON body containing a "pong" message echoing the received "ping" value.

## Logging
The `handlePing` function logs the received ping value to the console.
