## High-level description
The `checkWebhookRequestMeta` function is a test helper function that verifies the structure and content of the metadata included in a webhook request. It specifically checks for the presence and validity of the `type`, `messageId`, and `when` fields within the metadata object.

### `checkWebhookRequestMeta`
#### Description
This function checks the metadata of a webhook request to ensure it conforms to the expected structure and contains valid data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| whRequest | `WebhookRequest` \| `undefined` | The webhook request object to be checked. |
| type | `WebhookRequest["meta"]["type"]` | The expected type of the webhook request. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Assert Request Existence:** Checks if `whRequest` is truthy (not null or undefined). If not, throws an error.
2. **Assert Metadata Existence:** Checks if the `meta` property exists on the `whRequest`. If not, throws an error.
3. **Assert Metadata Structure:** Expects the `meta` object to contain the following properties with specific types:
    - `type`: Matches the `type` argument passed to the function.
    - `messageId`: Any value is accepted, but it's further validated in the next step.
    - `when`: Any value is accepted, but it's further validated in a later step.
4. **Validate Message ID:** Uses the `validateUuid` function to ensure the `messageId` is a valid UUID.
5. **Validate Timestamp:** 
    - Calculates an expected date range for the `when` property. The range is one minute before and one minute after the current time.
    - Converts the `when` property to a Date object.
    - Asserts that the received date falls within the expected date range.
6. **Assert Absence of `data`:** Expects the `meta` object to NOT contain a `data` property, or if it does, it should be falsy.

#### Side Effects
- Throws an error if any of the assertions fail.

## References
- `WebhookRequest`: This type likely represents the structure of a webhook request and is defined externally.
- `validateUuid`: This function is used to validate UUIDs and is likely imported from a utility library.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/shared/medical`: This package likely contains the definition of the `WebhookRequest` type.
- `dayjs`: This library is used for date and time manipulation.
- `uuid`: This library is used for UUID validation.

## Error Handling
- The function throws errors with descriptive messages if any of the assertions fail, aiding in debugging test failures.
