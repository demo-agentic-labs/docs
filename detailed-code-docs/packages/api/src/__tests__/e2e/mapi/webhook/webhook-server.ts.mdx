## High-level description
The `webhook-server.ts` file sets up a local webhook server using Express.js and exposes it to the internet using ngrok. This server is intended for end-to-end (E2E) testing of webhook functionality. It receives webhook requests, processes them with a dedicated handler (`webhook-handler`), and provides utility functions for managing the server lifecycle and webhook key.

## Code Structure
The code defines several functions related to the webhook server:
- `getWebhookServerUrl`: Returns the public URL of the running webhook server.
- `initWebhookServer`: Initializes the server, starts listening for requests, and exposes it via ngrok.
- `tearDownWebhookServer`: Stops the server and closes all connections.
- `storeWebhookKey`: Stores the webhook key for use in request validation.

The `app` object (an Express.js application) defines a single POST route (`/`) that handles incoming webhook requests using the `whHandler`.

## References
- `whHandler`: This symbol, imported from `./webhook-handler`, is responsible for processing incoming webhook requests.
- `getEnvVar`, `getEnvVarOrFail`: These utility functions, imported from `@metriport/shared`, are used to retrieve environment variables.

## Symbols

### `getWebhookServerUrl`
#### Description
This function retrieves the public URL of the running webhook server. It throws an error if the server is not initialized.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | `string` | The public URL of the webhook server. |

#### Internal Logic
The function checks if the `webhookServerUrl` variable is set. If not, it throws an error indicating the server is not initialized. Otherwise, it returns the `webhookServerUrl`.

### `initWebhookServer`
#### Description
This asynchronous function initializes the webhook server, starts listening for requests, and exposes it to the internet using ngrok.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the ngrok authentication token and optional custom domain from environment variables.
2. Starts the Express.js server and logs a message indicating it's listening on the specified port.
3. Connects to ngrok using the provided authentication token.
4. Creates an HTTP endpoint on the ngrok session, optionally using a custom domain.
5. Forwards traffic from the ngrok endpoint to the local server.
6. Stores the public ngrok URL in the `webhookServerUrl` variable.
7. Logs a message with the webhook server's external address.

### `tearDownWebhookServer`
#### Description
This asynchronous function stops the webhook server, disconnects from ngrok, and closes all connections.

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs a message indicating the server is being torn down.
2. Disconnects and kills the ngrok session.
3. Closes all connections to the Express.js server.
4. Closes the server and resolves a promise once the server has closed.

### `storeWebhookKey`
#### Description
This function stores the webhook key for use in request validation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | `string \| undefined \| null` | The webhook key to store. |

#### Internal Logic
The function calls the `storeWebhookKey` method of the `whHandler` object, passing the provided key.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Loads environment variables from a `.env` file. |
| @metriport/shared | Provides utility functions like `getEnvVar` and `sleep`. |
| @ngrok/ngrok | Exposes local servers to the internet. |
| express | Web framework for Node.js. |

## Error Handling
The code uses the `asyncHandler` function (imported from `../../../../routes/util`) to handle errors within asynchronous route handlers. This function logs error details and passes the error to the next middleware function.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` to log messages about the server's status, including when it starts listening, its external address, and when it's being torn down.
