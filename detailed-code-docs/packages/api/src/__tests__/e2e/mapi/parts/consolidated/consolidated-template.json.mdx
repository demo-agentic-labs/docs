title: "consolidated-template.json"

## High-level description
The code represents a JSON template for a FHIR Bundle resource. This bundle includes an AllergyIntolerance, a DocumentReference, and a Patient resource, all interconnected and populated with placeholder values. It is likely used for testing purposes to mock a response from the FHIR server.

## Code Structure
The JSON object represents a FHIR Bundle resource with three entries: AllergyIntolerance, DocumentReference, and Patient. The AllergyIntolerance resource references the Patient resource, and the DocumentReference resource contains both the Patient and Organization resources within its `contained` field. 

## Symbols
### `consolidated-template.json`
#### Description
This JSON object defines a template for a FHIR Bundle resource. It includes placeholders for various data points like IDs, dates, and patient information, which are likely to be replaced with actual values during testing.

#### Inputs
This is a static JSON template and does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This JSON template, when used in testing, would facilitate generating a mock FHIR Bundle resource.

#### Internal Logic
The template follows the FHIR standard for representing resources. It includes the necessary fields like `resourceType`, `id`, `meta`, and resource-specific data. The placeholders like `&lt;%= allergyId %&gt;`, `&lt;%= date %&gt;`, `&lt;%= lastName %&gt;`, etc., indicate areas where dynamic data would be inserted.

## Dependencies
This code likely depends on a FHIR library or framework for parsing and manipulating FHIR resources. However, the specific dependency cannot be determined from the provided code.
