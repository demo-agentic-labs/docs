## High-level description
This HTML file defines a template for a consolidated medical record summary. It includes placeholders for patient information, a table of contents, and various sections for different types of medical data. 

The template is designed to be populated with dynamic data, indicated by the use of template literals like `&lt;%= data %&gt;`, which will be replaced with actual values during rendering.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a standard HTML document with embedded CSS for styling and JavaScript template literals for dynamic data insertion. The main sections are:

- **`&lt;head&gt;`**: Contains metadata, title, and CSS styles for the document.
- **`&lt;body&gt;`**: Contains the main content of the medical record summary, including:
    - **Header**: Displays the logo, title, patient information, author information, and a table of contents.
    - **Sections**: Each section represents a specific category of medical information (e.g., Medications, Allergies, Procedures) and includes a placeholder table to be populated with data.
