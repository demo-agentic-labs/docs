## High-level description
This code defines end-to-end tests for the settings functionality of the medical API, specifically focusing on webhook interactions. It covers retrieving, updating, and verifying webhook settings, as well as simulating and validating ping webhook requests.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single function `runSettingsTests` which contains multiple `it` blocks, each testing a specific aspect of the settings functionality. It utilizes the `medicalApi` object to interact with the API under test and the `whServer` object to manage a local webhook server for testing purposes.

## References
- `medicalApi`: An API client used to interact with the medical API.
- `whServer`: An object representing a local webhook server used for testing.
- `getPingWebhookRequest`: A function to retrieve a ping webhook request from the webhook server.
- `checkWebhookRequestMeta`: A function to validate the metadata of a webhook request.

## Symbols
### `runSettingsTests`
#### Description
This function encapsulates a suite of end-to-end tests for the settings functionality of the medical API, focusing on webhook interactions.

#### Inputs
This function takes no direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no defined return value.

#### Internal Logic
The function consists of several `it` blocks, each testing a specific aspect:
- **"gets settings"**: Tests retrieving settings from the API and verifies a successful response.
- **"updates settings"**: Tests updating webhook settings in the API, ensuring the update is reflected in subsequent API responses and the webhook server state.
- **"makes sure we were able to process ping WH"**:  Includes a retry mechanism to handle potential timing issues with webhook processing after an update.
- **"receives ping WH request"**: Verifies that a ping webhook request is received by the webhook server after updating the settings.
- **"receives ping WH with correct data"**: Validates the content and metadata of the received ping webhook request, ensuring it conforms to the expected format.

## Side Effects
- This function interacts with the medical API, potentially modifying its state by updating settings.
- It also interacts with a local webhook server, storing webhook keys and retrieving received requests.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/shared`: Provides utility functions like `sleep`.
- `dayjs`: Used for date and time manipulation.
- `dayjs/plugin/duration`: Extends `dayjs` with duration functionality.
- `dayjs/plugin/isBetween`: Extends `dayjs` with a function to check if a date falls within a range.

## Error Handling
The code includes retry logic in the "makes sure we were able to process ping WH" test to handle potential timing issues with webhook processing. It also includes basic error handling in the "receives ping WH with correct data" test, throwing an error if the expected webhook request is not found.
