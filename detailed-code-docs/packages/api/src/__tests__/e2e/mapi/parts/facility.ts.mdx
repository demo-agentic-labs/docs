## High-level description
This file contains test utilities for working with `Facility` objects in the `@metriport/api` package. It defines a function `createFacility` for generating mock facility data and a function `validateFacility` for asserting the properties of a `Facility` object.

## Symbols

### `createFacility`
#### Description
This symbol is a constant that defines a mock `FacilityCreate` object. It uses `faker.js` to generate realistic-looking data for various fields like name, NPI, address, etc. This mock facility data can be used in tests to simulate interactions with the API.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `createFacility` | `FacilityCreate` | A mock `FacilityCreate` object with randomly generated data. |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `faker` library to generate random data for the following fields:
- `name`: A random noun.
- `npi`: A random 9-digit number.
- `active`: Set to `true`.
- `address`: An object containing the following randomly generated fields:
    - `addressLine1`: A random street address.
    - `city`: A random city.
    - `state`: The state of California (`USState.CA`).
    - `zip`: A random 5-digit zip code.
    - `country`: Set to "USA".

### `validateFacility`
#### Description
This function provides assertions to validate the properties of a `Facility` object. It can be used in tests to ensure that a `Facility` object has the expected data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `facility` | `Facility` | The `Facility` object to validate. |
| `facilityToCompare` | `FacilityCreate` \| `Facility` | (Optional) Another `FacilityCreate` or `Facility` object to compare against. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value. It performs assertions on the input `Facility` object.

#### Internal Logic
The function first checks if `facilityToCompare` is provided. 
- If `facilityToCompare` is provided, it compares the properties of the input `facility` object against the corresponding properties in `facilityToCompare`.
- If `facilityToCompare` is not provided, it simply checks if the properties of the input `facility` object are truthy.

The function uses Jest's `expect` API to perform the assertions.

## References
- `Facility`: This symbol refers to the `Facility` interface defined in the `@metriport/api-sdk` package.
- `FacilityCreate`: This symbol refers to the `FacilityCreate` interface defined in the `@metriport/api-sdk` package.
- `USState`: This symbol refers to the `USState` enum defined in the `@metriport/shared` package.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@faker-js/faker` | Used for generating realistic-looking mock data. |
| `@metriport/api-sdk` | Provides the `Facility` and `FacilityCreate` interfaces. |
| `@metriport/shared` | Provides the `USState` enum. |
