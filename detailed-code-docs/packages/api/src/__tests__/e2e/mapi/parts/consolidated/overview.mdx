## High-level description
This directory contains files related to the creation, validation, and testing of consolidated medical records in FHIR format. It includes templates for both HTML and JSON representations of the consolidated records, as well as TypeScript code for generating test data and validating the output against these templates.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates the creation and validation of consolidated medical records for end-to-end (E2E) testing purposes. It provides functionality to:

1. Generate a FHIR Bundle containing an AllergyIntolerance, a DocumentReference, and a Binary resource for a given patient.
2. Validate the generated JSON content against a predefined template.
3. Validate the generated HTML content against a predefined template.
4. Compare actual content against expected content from templates, handling template interpolation and file writing for mismatches.
5. Validate a received HTML file against the validation logic used in E2E tests.

These functionalities allow developers to create mock data for testing, ensure that the generated data matches expected formats, and validate the output of their API or system against predefined templates.

## Key Files

1. `consolidated-template.html`: This HTML template defines the structure for a consolidated medical record summary. It includes placeholders for patient information, a table of contents, and various sections for different types of medical data.

2. `consolidated-template.json`: This JSON template represents a FHIR Bundle resource, including an AllergyIntolerance, a DocumentReference, and a Patient resource. It's used for mocking responses from a FHIR server in testing scenarios.

3. `consolidated.ts`: This TypeScript file contains helper functions for creating and validating consolidated FHIR bundles. Key functions include:
   - `createConsolidatedPayloads`: Generates a FHIR bundle with AllergyIntolerance, DocumentReference, and Binary resources.
   - `checkConsolidatedJson`: Validates JSON content against the predefined template.
   - `checkConsolidatedHtml`: Validates HTML content against the predefined template.
   - `checkConsolidated`: A shared helper for comparing actual and expected output.

4. `validate-received-html.ts`: This script validates a consolidated HTML file received from the API against the validation logic used in E2E tests. It reads an HTML file, extracts relevant information, and compares it against expected values.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. FHIR: The code uses FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for representing healthcare data. This is evident from the use of FHIR resource types like Bundle, AllergyIntolerance, DocumentReference, and Binary.

2. dayjs: Used for date and time manipulation in the `validate-received-html.ts` script.

3. fs: Node.js File System module, used for reading and writing files in the validation process.

4. Other internal dependencies: The code references other modules and types (e.g., `PatientWithId`, `Consolidated`) that are likely defined elsewhere in the project.

## Configuration
The code uses template files (`consolidated-template.html` and `consolidated-template.json`) for configuration. These templates contain placeholders that are replaced with actual data during the generation and validation processes. Key configurable fields include:

- Patient information (ID, name, phone, email)
- Resource IDs (allergy, document, binary)
- Date formats
- FHIR resource structures

The `validate-received-html.ts` script also requires manual configuration of variables such as `patientId`, `lastName`, `allergyId`, and `receivedFileName` before running.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for generating, validating, and testing consolidated medical records in FHIR format, which is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of healthcare data in a testing environment.
