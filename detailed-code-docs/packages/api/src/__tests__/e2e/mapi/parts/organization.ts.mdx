## High-level description
This code defines several helper functions used for validating different representations of organizations. It includes functions for validating local `Organization` objects, FHIR `Organization` resources, `CWOrganization` objects, and `CqOrganization` objects. These functions are likely used in end-to-end tests to ensure data consistency across different systems.

## References
- `Organization` from "@metriport/api-sdk"
- `OrganizationCreate` from "@metriport/api-sdk"
- `OrgType` from "@metriport/api-sdk"
- `FhirOrg` (Organization) from "@medplum/fhirtypes"
- `USState` from "@metriport/shared"
- `CqOrganization` (Organization) from "@metriport/carequality-sdk"
- `CWOrganization` (Organization) from "@metriport/commonwell-sdk"

## Symbols

### `createOrg`
#### Description
A constant object representing a sample organization creation request. It is likely used as input for creating new organizations in tests.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a constant object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a constant object, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The object defines the following properties:
- `type`: Set to `OrgType.postAcuteCare`, indicating the type of organization.
- `name`: A randomly generated noun using `faker.word.noun()`.
- `location`: An object containing address details:
    - `addressLine1`: Set to "1234 Market St".
    - `city`: Set to "San Francisco".
    - `state`: Set to `USState.CA`, representing California.
    - `zip`: Set to "12345".
    - `country`: Set to "USA".

### `validateLocalOrg`
#### Description
This function validates a local `Organization` object against an optional `OrganizationCreate` or another `Organization` object. It checks for the presence and optionally the equality of various properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | `Organization` | The local `Organization` object to validate. |
| orgToCompare | `OrganizationCreate` \| `Organization` | (optional) An object to compare the `Organization` object against. |

#### Outputs
N/A - This function asserts expectations and does not return a value.

#### Internal Logic
1. It asserts that the `org` object and its properties (`id`, `location`, `oid`) are truthy.
2. If `orgToCompare` is provided:
   - It asserts that the `type`, `name`, and location properties (`addressLine1`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`) of `org` match the corresponding properties in `orgToCompare`.
3. If `orgToCompare` is not provided:
   - It asserts that the `type`, `name`, and location properties (`addressLine1`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`) of `org` are truthy.

___

### `validateFhirOrg`
#### Description
This function validates a FHIR `Organization` resource against an optional `OrganizationCreate` or `Organization` object. It checks for the presence and optionally the equality of various properties, considering the structure of a FHIR resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | `FhirOrg` | The FHIR `Organization` resource to validate. |
| orgToCompare | `OrganizationCreate` \| `Organization` | (optional) An object to compare the FHIR `Organization` resource against. |

#### Outputs
N/A - This function asserts expectations and does not return a value.

#### Internal Logic
1. It asserts that the `org` object, its `resourceType` property, and `id` are truthy.
2. It asserts that the `resourceType` is "Organization".
3. It asserts that the `address` property is truthy and has a length of 1.
4. If `orgToCompare` is provided:
   - It asserts that the `name` property of `org` matches the `name` property in `orgToCompare`.
   - It asserts that the address components (`line[0]`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, `country`) within the first element of the `address` array in `org` match the corresponding properties in `orgToCompare`.
5. If `orgToCompare` is not provided:
   - It asserts that the `name` property and address components (`line[0]`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, `country`) within the first element of the `address` array in `org` are truthy.

___

### `validateCwOrg`
#### Description
This function validates a `CWOrganization` object against an optional `OrganizationCreate` or `Organization` object. It checks for the presence and optionally the equality of various properties, considering the structure of a `CWOrganization`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | `CWOrganization` | The `CWOrganization` object to validate. |
| orgToCompare | `OrganizationCreate` \| `Organization` | (optional) An object to compare the `CWOrganization` object against. |

#### Outputs
N/A - This function asserts expectations and does not return a value.

#### Internal Logic
1. It asserts that the `org` object and its properties (`organizationId`, `locations`, `technicalContacts`, `isActive`, `_links`) are truthy.
2. It asserts that the `locations` array has a length of 1.
3. If `orgToCompare` is provided:
   - It asserts that the `name` property of `org` matches the `name` property in `orgToCompare`.
   - It asserts that the address components (`address1`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, `country`) within the first element of the `locations` array in `org` match the corresponding properties in `orgToCompare`.
4. If `orgToCompare` is not provided:
   - It asserts that the `name` property and address components (`address1`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, `country`) within the first element of the `locations` array in `org` are truthy.

___

### `validateCqOrg`
#### Description
This function validates a `CqOrganization` object against an optional `OrganizationCreate` or `Organization` object. It checks for the presence and optionally the equality of `name` and `identifier.value` properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | `CqOrganization` | The `CqOrganization` object to validate. |
| orgToCompare | `OrganizationCreate` \| `Organization` | (optional) An object to compare the `CqOrganization` object against. |

#### Outputs
N/A - This function asserts expectations and does not return a value.

#### Internal Logic
1. It asserts that the `org` object and its `identifier.value` property are truthy.
2. If `orgToCompare` is provided:
   - It asserts that the `name` property of `org` matches the `name` property in `orgToCompare`.
   - If `orgToCompare` has an `oid` property, it asserts that the `identifier.value` property of `org` matches the `oid` property in `orgToCompare`.
3. If `orgToCompare` is not provided:
   - It asserts that the `name` property of `org` is truthy.
