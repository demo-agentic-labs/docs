## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript types for representing Withings workout log data fetched from the Withings API. It uses the `zod` library for validation and type inference. It also includes a mapping of Withings workout category IDs to human-readable names.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main symbols: `withingsWorkoutLogsResp` and `categories`. `withingsWorkoutLogsResp` is a `zod` schema that describes the structure of the Withings workout log response. `categories` is a simple object mapping Withings category IDs to their corresponding names.

## Symbols
### `withingsWorkoutLogsResp`
#### Description
A `zod` schema that validates and infers the type of the Withings workout log response. It ensures the response is an array of objects, each representing a workout log entry. Each entry contains various fields like category, start/end times, date, and workout data.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a `zod` schema, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a `zod` schema, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit outputs. It defines a type, `WithingsWorkoutLogs`, which represents the validated data structure.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the expected structure of a Withings workout log response. It specifies each field's type and whether it's optional or nullable. For instance:
- `category`: A required number representing the workout category.
- `startdate`: A required number representing the workout start time in Unix timestamp format.
- `data`: An optional object containing detailed workout information like calories burned, distance covered, heart rate, etc.

### `WithingsWorkoutLogs`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias that represents the validated Withings workout log data. It's inferred from the `withingsWorkoutLogsResp` schema using `z.infer`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function, so it doesn't have outputs.

### `categories`
#### Description
A constant object mapping Withings workout category IDs (numbers) to their corresponding human-readable names (strings).

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a constant object, not a function, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a constant object, not a function, so it doesn't have outputs. You can access the category name by its ID using array-like access, e.g., `categories[1]` returns "Walk".
