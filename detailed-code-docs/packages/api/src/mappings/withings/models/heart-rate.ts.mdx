## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema (`withingsHeartRateResp`) to validate and type-check the response data from the Withings Heart Rate API endpoint. It also exports a type alias (`WithingsHeartRate`) for convenience.

## References
- `z` from "zod": Used for defining the Zod schema.

## Symbols
### `withingsHeartRateResp`
#### Description
A Zod schema that validates the response data from the Withings Heart Rate API endpoint. It ensures that the response is an array of objects, each representing a heart rate measurement with optional properties like device ID, model, ECG data, blood pressure, heart rate, timestamp, and timezone.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the expected structure and data types for each property in the heart rate measurement object:
- `deviceid`: Optional string, nullable.
- `model`: Optional number, nullable.
- `ecg`: Optional object with `signalid` (number) and `afib` (number) properties.
- `bloodpressure`: Optional object with `diastole` (number) and `systole` (number) properties.
- `heart_rate`: Required number.
- `timestamp`: Required number.
- `timezone`: Optional string.

### `WithingsHeartRate`
#### Description
A type alias that represents the validated type of the Withings Heart Rate API response data, inferred from the `withingsHeartRateResp` Zod schema.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.
