## High-level description
The code defines a function `mapToSleep` that transforms sleep data retrieved from the Withings API into the standardized `Sleep` object used within the application. This involves extracting relevant fields from the Withings data, converting timestamps, and mapping them to the corresponding fields in the `Sleep` object.

## References
- `Sleep`: This symbol is referenced from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package, indicating its role in representing sleep data within the application.
- `PROVIDER_WITHINGS`: A constant likely used to denote the data source as Withings.
- `WithingsSleep`: A type definition representing the raw sleep data structure returned by the Withings API.
- `Util`: A utility class providing helper functions for data manipulation.

## Symbols

### `mapToSleep`
#### Description
This function maps raw sleep data from Withings API to the application's standardized `Sleep` object. It extracts relevant fields from the Withings data, performs necessary conversions, and populates the `Sleep` object accordingly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | string | The date of the sleep data in YYYY-MM-DD format. |
| withingsSleep | `WithingsSleep` | Raw sleep data received from the Withings API. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sleep | `Sleep` | The standardized `Sleep` object populated with mapped data from the Withings input. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Creates a `metadata` object containing the date and source (PROVIDER_WITHINGS).
   - Initializes an empty `sleep` object of type `Sleep` with the `metadata`.
2. **Data Extraction and Mapping:**
   - Checks if `withingsSleep` array has data. If yes, it processes the first entry (assumed to be the main sleep session).
   - Extracts `startdate` and `enddate` from `withingsSleep`, converts them to ISO strings using `dayjs.unix`, and sets them as `start_time` and `end_time` in the `sleep` object.
   - If `data` is present in `withingsSleep`, it further extracts sleep durations (total sleep, awake, deep, REM, light, in bed) and populates the `durations` field in the `sleep` object using the `Util.addDataToObject` helper.
   - Similarly, it extracts heart rate data (min, average, max) and populates the `biometrics.heart_rate` field in the `sleep` object.
3. **Return:** Returns the populated `sleep` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides the `Sleep` interface for standardized sleep data. |
| dayjs | Used for date and time manipulation, specifically for converting Unix timestamps to ISO strings. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond what's provided by the language or used libraries. It assumes the input data is in the expected format.
