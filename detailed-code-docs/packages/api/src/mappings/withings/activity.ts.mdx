## High-level description
This code defines two functions, `mapToActivity` and `formatWorkoutLogs`, that transform Withings activity and workout data into the standard `Activity` and `ActivityLog` formats used by the application. 

The `mapToActivity` function serves as the main entry point, orchestrating the transformation of raw Withings data into a consolidated `Activity` object containing both activity and workout logs.

## Code Structure
The `mapToActivity` function depends on `formatActivityLogs` and `formatWorkoutLogs` to transform Withings activity and workout data respectively. Both of these functions use the `Util.addDataToObject` function.

## References
- `Activity`: Represents the standardized activity data structure.
- `ActivityLog`: Represents the standardized activity log data structure.
- `Metadata`: Represents the standardized metadata structure.
- `PROVIDER_WITHINGS`: A constant likely representing the Withings data provider.
- `WithingsActivityLogs`: Represents the raw activity data structure from Withings.
- `WithingsWorkoutLogs`: Represents the raw workout data structure from Withings.
- `Util.addDataToObject`: A utility function that conditionally adds data to an object.

## Symbols

### `mapToActivity`
#### Description
This function maps Withings activity and workout data to a standardized `Activity` object. It extracts relevant data points from the Withings data structures and populates the corresponding fields in the `Activity` and `ActivityLog` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | string | The date of the activity data. |
| withingsActivityLogs | `WithingsActivityLogs` | Raw activity data from Withings. |
| withingsWorkoutLogs | `WithingsWorkoutLogs` | Raw workout data from Withings. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| activity | `Activity` | A standardized `Activity` object containing the transformed activity and workout data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `metadata` object with the date and data source (Withings).
2. Calls `formatActivityLogs` to transform the Withings activity data.
3. Calls `formatWorkoutLogs` to transform the Withings workout data.
4. Combines the transformed activity and workout logs into a single array.
5. Returns a new `Activity` object populated with the metadata and the combined activity logs.

### `formatActivityLogs`
#### Description
This function transforms an array of `WithingsActivityLogs` into an array of standardized `ActivityLog` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | `Metadata` | Metadata associated with the activity logs. |
| withingsActivityLogs | `WithingsActivityLogs` | An array of raw activity logs from Withings. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| activityLogs | `ActivityLog[]` | An array of standardized `ActivityLog` objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each `withingsActivityLog` in the input array.
2. For each log, extracts relevant data points like active duration, intensity levels, energy expenditure, steps, elevation, distance, and heart rate.
3. Populates a new `ActivityLog` object with the extracted data and the provided metadata.
4. Appends the newly created `ActivityLog` to the `activityLogs` array.
5. Returns the `activityLogs` array.

### `formatWorkoutLogs`
#### Description
This function transforms an array of `WithingsWorkoutLogs` into an array of standardized `ActivityLog` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | `Metadata` | Metadata associated with the workout logs. |
| withingsWorkoutLogs | `WithingsWorkoutLogs` | An array of raw workout logs from Withings. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workoutLogs | `ActivityLog[]` | An array of standardized `ActivityLog` objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each `withingsWorkoutLog` in the input array.
2. For each log, extracts relevant data points like start and end times, workout category, manual calories burned, steps, elevation, distance, heart rate data, and SpO2 data.
3. Populates a new `ActivityLog` object with the extracted data and the provided metadata.
4. Appends the newly created `ActivityLog` to the `workoutLogs` array.
5. Returns the `workoutLogs` array.

## Dependencies
- `dayjs`: Used for date and time manipulation.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.

## Logging
The code does not implement logging.
