## High-level description
The `mapToBody` function in `packages/api/src/mappings/withings/body.ts` is responsible for transforming raw Withings measurement data into a standardized `Body` object as defined in the `@metriport/api-sdk`. This transformation involves extracting relevant measurements like weight, height, body fat percentage, etc., calculating averages where applicable, and formatting the data according to the `Body` object's structure.

## Code Structure
The code primarily revolves around the `mapToBody` function, which orchestrates the data transformation. It utilizes the `getMeasurementResults` function to pre-process the raw Withings measurements, grouping them by measurement type. The `mapToBody` function then iterates through these grouped measurements, extracting and formatting the necessary data points to populate the `Body` object.

## References
- `Body` type from `@metriport/api-sdk`
- `Sample` type from `@metriport/api-sdk/devices/models/common/sample`
- `Util` class from `../../shared/util`
- `PROVIDER_WITHINGS` constant from `../../shared/constants`
- `WithingsUserDevices` type from `./models/user`
- `WithingsMeasurements`, `WithingsMeasurementGrp`, `WithingsMeasType` types from `./models/measurements`

## Symbols

### `mapToBody`
#### Description
This function maps Withings measurement data to a standardized `Body` object. It extracts relevant measurements, calculates averages, and formats the data according to the `Body` object's structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `date` | string | The date of the measurements in YYYY-MM-DD format. |
| `withingsMeasurements` | `WithingsMeasurements` | Raw measurement data received from Withings API. |
| `devices` | `WithingsUserDevices` | (Optional) Array of user's Withings devices. Used to enrich weight samples with device information. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `body` | `Body` | A standardized `Body` object containing the transformed Withings data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Creates a `metadata` object containing the date and source of the data.
   - Initializes an empty `Body` object.
2. **Measurement Processing:**
   - Calls `getMeasurementResults` to group the raw Withings measurements by type.
   - Iterates through the grouped measurements, extracting and formatting data for:
     - `weight_kg`: Average weight in kilograms.
     - `weight_samples_kg`: Array of weight samples, enriched with device information if available.
     - `height_cm`: Average height in centimeters.
     - `lean_mass_kg`: Average lean mass in kilograms.
     - `body_fat_pct`: Average body fat percentage.
     - `bone_mass_kg`: Average bone mass in kilograms.
3. **Return:** Returns the populated `Body` object.

### `getMeasurementResults`
#### Description
This function processes raw Withings measurement data, grouping measurements by type and creating an array of samples for each type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `measuregrps` | `WithingsMeasurementGrp[]` | An array of Withings measurement groups. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `ResultsMeasurements` | `{ [key: number]: SampleWithDataSourceId[]; }` | An object where keys are Withings measurement types (`WithingsMeasType`) and values are arrays of corresponding samples. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Filtering:** Filters out inconclusive measurements from the input array.
2. **Reduction:** Uses a reducer function to iterate through the filtered measurements and group them by type.
3. **Sample Creation:** For each measurement within a group:
   - Extracts the measurement value, type, and timestamp.
   - Creates a `SampleWithDataSourceId` object containing the extracted data.
   - Appends the sample to the corresponding measurement type array in the accumulator object.
4. **Return:** Returns the accumulator object containing grouped measurements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@metriport/api-sdk` | Provides the standardized `Body` object definition. |
| `@metriport/api-sdk/devices/models/common/sample` | Provides the `Sample` type for representing individual measurements. |
| `convert-units` | Used for unit conversion (meters to centimeters). |
| `dayjs` | Used for date and time manipulation. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond potential exceptions thrown by the used libraries.

## TODOs
- The `createDiastolicSamples`, `createSystolicSamples`, and `createHrSamples` functions in the related file `packages/api/src/mappings/withings/biometrics.ts` are marked with a TODO to refactor. This might indicate potential code duplication or areas for improvement in handling Withings heart rate data.
