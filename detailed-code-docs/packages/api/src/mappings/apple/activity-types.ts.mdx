## High-level description
The code defines a TypeScript constant object named `activityTypeMapping` that maps numerical activity type IDs to their corresponding string representations. This mapping is likely used to translate raw activity data from a source like Apple HealthKit into more human-readable and consistent activity names within the application. 

## Symbols

### `activityTypeMapping`
#### Description
A constant object that maps numerical activity type IDs (presumably from Apple HealthKit) to their corresponding string descriptions. This mapping facilitates the translation of raw activity data into more understandable and consistent activity names within the application.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a constant object, not a function, so it doesn't take inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This object itself is the output, representing a mapping of activity type IDs to their string descriptions.

#### Internal Logic
The object is structured as a key-value pair mapping, where:
- **Keys:** Numerical activity type IDs (e.g., `83`, `82`, `300`, etc.)
- **Values:** Corresponding string descriptions of the activity types (e.g., "Transition", "Swim Bike Run", "Other", etc.)

## References
- This `activityTypeMapping` object is referenced in the `mapDataToActivity` function within the `packages/api/src/mappings/apple/activity.ts` file. It is used to determine the `name` property of an `ActivityLog` object based on the `type` property of a `workoutItem` (presumably from Apple Health data). 
```typescript
// ... other code ...
 name: activityTypeMapping[workoutItem.type],
// ... other code ...
```

## Dependencies
