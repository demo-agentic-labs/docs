## High-level description
The `mapDataToBody` function transforms Apple Health data related to body composition into an array of `Body` objects, suitable for use with the Metriport API. It handles data points for height, lean mass, weight, and body fat percentage, converting units where necessary.

## Code Structure
The function iterates through various properties of the input `AppleHealth` object, each representing a different body metric. For each metric, it calls the `addToBody` function to process and append the data to the `body` array. The `dateToIndex` object is used to group data points by date.

## References
- `Body`: This symbol is referenced from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package and represents the structure of body data expected by the API.
- `AppleHealth`: This symbol is defined in the same file (`packages/api/src/mappings/apple/index.ts`) and represents the structure of raw data received from Apple Health.
- `AppleHealthItem`: This symbol is also defined in `packages/api/src/mappings/apple/index.ts` and represents a single data point within the `AppleHealth` object.
- `createMetadata`: This symbol is defined in `packages/api/src/mappings/apple/index.ts` and is used to generate metadata for each `Body` object.

## Symbols

### `mapDataToBody`
#### Description
This function processes raw Apple Health data and maps relevant fields to an array of `Body` objects, grouping data points by date.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | `AppleHealth` | Raw data from Apple Health, containing various body metrics. |
| hourly | `boolean` | Flag indicating whether the data is hourly or daily. Used for generating metadata. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | `Body[]` | An array of `Body` objects, each representing body composition data for a specific date. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an empty `body` array to store the transformed data.
2. Creates a `dateToIndex` object to keep track of the index of each date in the `body` array.
3. Defines an `addToBody` function that takes an `AppleHealthItem` and a key (representing the body metric) as input.
    - Formats the date of the `AppleHealthItem`.
    - Checks if the date already exists in the `dateToIndex` object.
        - If yes, updates the existing `Body` object at the corresponding index with the new metric value.
        - If not, creates a new `Body` object with the metric value and metadata, adds it to the `body` array, and updates the `dateToIndex` object.
4. Iterates through the relevant properties of the `data` object (e.g., `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeight`, `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBodyMass`).
    - For each property, calls `addToBody` to process and add the data to the `body` array.
5. Applies a specific conversion for body fat percentage, multiplying the value by 100.
6. Returns the populated `body` array.

## Side Effects
None.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/api-sdk`: Provides the `Body` type definition.
- `dayjs`: Used for date formatting.
