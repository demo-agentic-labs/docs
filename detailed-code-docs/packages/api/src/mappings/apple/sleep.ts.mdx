## High-level description
The `mapDataToSleep` function in `sleep.ts` transforms raw Apple Health data into a structured array of `Sleep` objects, suitable for use in the Metriport API. It specifically handles different sleep stages (in bed, awake, REM, core, deep) and calculates durations for each stage within each sleep session.

## Code Structure
The `mapDataToSleep` function iterates over the raw Apple Health sleep data, using the `addInBedToSleep` helper function to create base `Sleep` objects for "inBed" events. It then iterates again, this time updating the existing `Sleep` objects with durations for other sleep stages ("awake", "core", "deep", "rem") by matching them based on timestamps.

## References
- `Sleep`: This symbol is referenced from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package, indicating its role in representing sleep data within the application.
- `AppleHealth`, `AppleHealthSleepItem`, `SleepType`, `createMetadata`: These symbols are imported from a local file (likely within the same `apple` directory), suggesting they are specific to processing Apple Health data.

## Symbols

### `mapDataToSleep`
#### Description
This function processes raw Apple Health data and maps it to an array of `Sleep` objects, calculating durations for different sleep stages.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | `AppleHealth` | Raw Apple Health data containing sleep information. |
| hourly | `boolean` | Flag indicating whether to include hourly granularity in the output metadata. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sleep | `Sleep[]` | An array of `Sleep` objects representing the processed sleep data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:** An empty array `sleep` is created to store the processed `Sleep` objects.
2. **Iterate over "inBed" events:** The function iterates over the `HKCategoryValueSleepAnalysis` array in the input `data`, which presumably contains sleep stage information. For each item representing "inBed" events:
    - It creates a `Sleep` object with basic metadata (date, source, start/end times) using the `createMetadata` function.
    - It sets the `in_bed_seconds` duration within the `durations` property of the `Sleep` object.
    - It pushes the created `Sleep` object into the `sleep` array.
3. **Iterate over other sleep stages:** The function iterates over the `HKCategoryValueSleepAnalysis` array again. For each item representing sleep stages other than "inBed":
    - It finds the corresponding `Sleep` object in the `sleep` array based on the start time of the event.
    - It updates the `durations` property of the matched `Sleep` object with the duration of the current sleep stage ("awake", "core", "deep", "rem").
    - For "awake" events, it also increments the `wakeup_frequency` counter in the `Sleep` object.
4. **Return:** Finally, the function returns the populated `sleep` array containing the processed sleep data.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/api-sdk`: Provides the `Sleep` type and potentially other data structures used for representing sleep data.
- `dayjs`: Used for date and time manipulation, specifically formatting timestamps.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond potential runtime exceptions. It assumes the input data conforms to the expected `AppleHealth` structure.
