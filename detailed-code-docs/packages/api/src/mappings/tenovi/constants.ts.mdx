## High-level description
This file defines constants related to Tenovi devices, specifically a list of supported metric types. These metric types represent various health measurements that Tenovi devices can record.

## Symbols

### `tenoviMetricTypes`
#### Description
A constant array of strings representing all the supported metric types from Tenovi devices. This array is used to validate incoming metric types and map them to the appropriate data structures.

#### Inputs
_This symbol does not accept any inputs._

#### Outputs
_This symbol does not return any outputs._

#### Internal Logic
The array is defined using `as const` to ensure type safety and allow TypeScript to infer the type of each element as a string literal.

### `TenoviMetricTypes`
#### Description
A type alias representing the union of all possible string literal types from the `tenoviMetricTypes` array. This type can be used to enforce type safety when working with Tenovi metric types.

#### Inputs
_This symbol does not accept any inputs._

#### Outputs
_This symbol does not return any outputs._

#### Internal Logic
The type is defined using `(typeof tenoviMetricTypes)[number]` which extracts the type of each element in the `tenoviMetricTypes` array and creates a union type of all those types.
## References
- `tenoviMetricTypes` is referenced in `packages/api/src/command/webhook/tenovi.ts` to validate incoming metric types from Tenovi webhooks.
