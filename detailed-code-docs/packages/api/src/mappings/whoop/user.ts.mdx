- `PROVIDER_WHOOP`: This constant is referenced from the `../../shared/constants` file, likely representing an identifier for the Whoop data source.
- `WhoopUser`: This type is referenced from the `./models/user` file, indicating a specific model for representing Whoop user data.

### `mapToUser`
#### Description

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| whoopUser | `WhoopUser` | The Whoop user object to be mapped. |
| date | `string` | The date associated with the user data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
