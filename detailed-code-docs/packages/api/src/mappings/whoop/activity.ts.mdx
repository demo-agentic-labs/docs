## High-level description
The code defines a function `mapToActivity` that transforms an array of Whoop workout data into a standardized `Activity` object as defined in the `@metriport/api-sdk`. This transformation involves extracting relevant workout details, calculating energy expenditure, and structuring the data into the `ActivityLog` format.

## Symbols

### `mapToActivity`
#### Description
This function takes an array of `WhoopWorkout` objects and a date string as input. It iterates through each workout, extracts relevant data like start/end times, strain durations, energy expenditure, and biometrics, and maps them to the `ActivityLog` structure. Finally, it returns an `Activity` object containing these activity logs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| whoopWorkouts | `WhoopWorkout[]` | An array of Whoop workout data. |
| date | `string` | The date for which the activity data is being mapped. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| activity | `Activity` | A standardized activity object containing the mapped workout data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an empty `activityLogs` array to store mapped workout data.
2. Iterates through each `workout` in the `whoopWorkouts` array.
3. For each workout:
    - Creates a base `activityLog` object with metadata, start/end times.
    - If the workout has a score (`score_state` is "SCORED"):
        - Extracts strain durations, energy expenditure (converting from kilojoules to kilocalories), movement data, and heart rate biometrics from the `workout.score` object.
        - Populates the `activityLog` with the extracted data.
    - Pushes the populated `activityLog` into the `activityLogs` array.
4. Constructs and returns an `Activity` object with the `activityLogs` and metadata.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides the data models for Activity, ActivityLog, etc. |

```typescript
import { Activity } from "@metriport/api-sdk";
```
