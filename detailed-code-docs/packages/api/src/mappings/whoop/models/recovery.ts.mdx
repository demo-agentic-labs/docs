## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript type representing the structure of a Whoop Recovery response from the Whoop API. It uses the `zod` library for schema validation and type inference.

## References
- `whoopScoreSchema` from `./score`

## Symbols
### `whoopRecoveryResp`
#### Description
This symbol is a Zod schema that defines the structure and types for a Whoop Recovery response object. It ensures that the response data conforms to the expected format.

#### Inputs
None. This is a Zod schema, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. This is a Zod schema, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields and their types:
- `cycle_id`: A number representing the cycle ID.
- `sleep_id`: A number representing the sleep ID.
- `user_id`: A number representing the user ID.
- `created_at`: A string representing the creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: A string representing the last update timestamp.
- `score_state`: An object conforming to the `whoopScoreSchema` representing the score state.
- `score`: An optional object that may be null, containing:
    - `user_calibrating`: A boolean indicating if the user is in calibration phase.
    - `recovery_score`: A number representing the recovery score.
    - `resting_heart_rate`: A number representing the resting heart rate.
    - `hrv_rmssd_milli`: A number representing the RMSSD value in milliseconds.
    - `spo2_percentage`: An optional nullable number representing the SPO2 percentage.
    - `skin_temp_celsius`: An optional nullable number representing the skin temperature in Celsius.

### `WhoopRecovery`
#### Description
This symbol is a TypeScript type alias that infers the type of the data validated by the `whoopRecoveryResp` schema. It represents the structure of a parsed and validated Whoop Recovery response object.

#### Inputs
None. This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. This is a type alias, not a function.

## Dependencies
- `zod`: Used for schema validation and type inference.

## API/Interface Reference
This code doesn't expose an API. It defines types for data received from the Whoop API.
