## High-level description
The code defines a Zod schema, `whoopWorkoutResp`, for validating the structure and data types of workout data fetched from the Whoop API. It represents a single workout session and includes details like start/end times, sport ID, score, heart rate, and zone durations. 

This schema is used to parse and validate the JSON response received from the Whoop API, ensuring that the data conforms to the expected format before further processing.

## References
- `whoopScoreSchema`: Used to validate the `score_state` field within the workout data.

### `whoopWorkoutResp`
#### Description
A Zod schema defining the structure and data types for a workout response from the Whoop API.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines various fields and their expected types:
- `id`: Numerical ID of the workout.
- `user_id`: Numerical ID of the user.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of workout creation.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last update.
- `start`: Timestamp of workout start.
- `end`: Timestamp of workout end.
- `timezone_offset`: Timezone offset for the workout.
- `sport_id`: Numerical ID representing the sport type (mapping not yet defined).
- `score_state`: Uses the `whoopScoreSchema` to validate the scoring status.
- `score`: An optional object containing detailed workout metrics like strain, heart rate, energy expenditure, and zone durations.

### `WhoopWorkout`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias representing the inferred type of the `whoopWorkoutResp` schema. This type can be used for type checking and code completion when working with validated Whoop workout data.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

## TODOs
- **TODO:** map `sport_id` to some activity types, can't find a definition for this anywhere.
