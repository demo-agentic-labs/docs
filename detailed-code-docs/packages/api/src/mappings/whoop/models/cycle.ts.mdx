## High-level description
The code defines a TypeScript interface `WhoopCycle` for representing Whoop cycle data fetched from the Whoop API. It uses the `zod` library for schema validation and type inference.

## References
- `whoopScoreSchema` from "./score"

## Symbols
### `whoopCycleResp`
#### Description
A `zod` schema that validates the response from the Whoop API for cycle data. It defines the expected shape and types of the data.

#### Inputs
None. This is a `zod` schema, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. This is a `zod` schema, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines various fields and their types, including:
- `id`: a number representing the cycle ID.
- `user_id`: a number representing the user ID.
- `created_at`: a string representing the creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: a string representing the last update timestamp.
- `start`: a string representing the cycle start date.
- `end`: an optional nullable string representing the cycle end date.
- `timezone_offset`: a string representing the timezone offset.
- `score_state`: a `whoopScoreSchema` enum value representing the score state.
- `score`: an optional nullable object containing strain, kilojoule, average heart rate, and max heart rate.

### `WhoopCycle`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias that infers the type of the data validated by the `whoopCycleResp` schema. It represents a Whoop cycle object.

#### Inputs
None. This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. This is a type alias, not a function.

## Dependencies
- `zod`: Used for schema validation and type inference.

## Error Handling
The `zod` library will throw errors if the data being validated does not match the defined schema. This ensures that the `WhoopCycle` type is always consistent with the expected data structure.
