## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript type for representing user data retrieved from the Whoop API. It uses the `zod` library for schema validation and type inference.

## References
- This code references the `zod` library for schema definition and type inference.

## Symbols
### `whoopUserResp`
#### Description
This symbol defines a `zod` schema for validating the structure and types of the JSON response received from the Whoop API's user endpoint.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema specifies that the response should be a JSON object with the following fields:
- `user_id`: A number representing the user's ID.
- `email`: A string representing the user's email address.
- `first_name`: A string representing the user's first name.
- `last_name`: A string representing the user's last name.

### `WhoopUser`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type based on the inferred type of the `whoopUserResp` schema. This ensures that any variable declared as `WhoopUser` will have the same structure and types as defined in the schema.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

## Dependencies
- **zod:** Used for schema validation and type inference.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling. Any validation errors during parsing with the `zod` schema will result in exceptions being thrown.
