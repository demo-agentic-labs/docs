title: "sleep.ts"

## High-level description
The code defines a function `mapToSleep` that transforms sleep data from the Whoop API (`WhoopSleep` object) into a standardized `Sleep` object defined in the `@metriport/api-sdk`. This transformation involves extracting relevant fields, converting units, and structuring the data according to the `Sleep` interface. 

## References
- `Sleep`: This interface is defined in the `@metriport/api-sdk` package and dictates the structure of the output sleep data.
- `PROVIDER_WHOOP`: A constant likely defined in the `shared/constants` file to represent the "Whoop" data source.
- `WhoopSleep`: This interface, presumably defined in `./models/sleep`, represents the raw sleep data structure returned by the Whoop API.

## Symbols

### `mapToSleep`
#### Description
This function converts raw sleep data from the Whoop API into a standardized `Sleep` object. It handles different data availability scenarios based on the `score_state` property of the input.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `whoopSleep` | `WhoopSleep` | Raw sleep data object from the Whoop API. |
| `date` | `string` | Date string representing the day of the sleep data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `sleep` | `Sleep` | Standardized sleep data object conforming to the `Sleep` interface. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:** Creates a basic `Sleep` object with metadata (date and source).
2. **Data Extraction:** Extracts `start_time` and `end_time` directly from `whoopSleep`.
3. **Conditional Score Processing:**
   - Checks if `whoopSleep.score_state` is "SCORED" (meaning sleep analysis is available).
   - If scored, extracts various sleep stage durations from `whoopSleep.score.stage_summary` and converts them from milliseconds to seconds using the `convert-units` library.
   - Extracts average breaths per minute from `whoopSleep.score.respiratory_rate`.
   - Populates the `durations` and `biometrics` fields of the `sleep` object.
4. **Returns:** The fully populated `Sleep` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@metriport/api-sdk` | Provides the `Sleep` interface for standardized sleep data. |
| `convert-units` | Used for converting time durations from milliseconds to seconds. |

## Error Handling
- The function throws an error if `whoopSleep.score` is missing when `whoopSleep.score_state` is "SCORED", indicating inconsistent data.
