## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `activityTypeReadable` that converts Garmin activity type codes into more human-readable strings. It also defines a mapping of Garmin activity type codes to their corresponding readable names.

## References
- This code is referenced by `activity.ts` to map activity types.

### `activityTypeReadable`
#### Description
This function takes a Garmin activity type code as input and returns a more human-readable string representation of the activity type. It achieves this by first checking if a mapping exists for the given activity type code in the `activityTypeMapping` object. If a mapping exists, it uses the mapped value. Otherwise, it replaces underscores, "V" followed by digits, and "WS" with spaces in the input string and capitalizes each word.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| activityType | string | The Garmin activity type code to convert to a readable string. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | A human-readable string representation of the activity type. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the `activityType` exists as a key in the `activityTypeMapping` object.
2. If it exists, return the corresponding value from the mapping.
3. If it doesn't exist, replace underscores, "V" followed by digits, and "WS" with spaces in the `activityType` string.
4. Capitalize each word in the resulting string.
5. Return the capitalized string.

### `activityTypeMapping`
#### Description
This constant defines a mapping of Garmin activity type codes to their corresponding human-readable names. This mapping is used by the `activityTypeReadable` function to provide more user-friendly activity type names.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a constant variable.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a constant variable.

#### Internal Logic
This is a simple object literal that maps Garmin activity type codes (keys) to their corresponding human-readable names (values).
