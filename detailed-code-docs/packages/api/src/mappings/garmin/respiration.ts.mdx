## High-level description
The `mapToBiometricsFromRespiration` function processes Garmin respiration data and transforms it into a standardized `Biometrics` format. It groups the input data by user, extracts breath measurements, and organizes them by date to create `Biometrics` objects containing respiration samples.

## Code Structure
The code defines a type `BreathAndDate` and two functions: `mapToBiometricsFromRespiration` and `toBreaths`. 
- `mapToBiometricsFromRespiration` is the main function that orchestrates the data transformation process. It uses `toBreaths` to extract breath data and then groups it by date.
- `toBreaths` is a helper function that extracts breath measurements from the raw Garmin data and formats them as an array of `BreathAndDate` objects.

## References
- `Biometrics`: This symbol is referenced from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package and represents the standardized format for biometrics data.
- `garminMetaSchema`, `garminTypes`, `User`, `UserData`: These symbols are defined in other files within the same project and provide data structures and utility functions for handling Garmin data.
- `PROVIDER_GARMIN`: This constant is defined in a separate file and represents the identifier for the Garmin data source.
- `secondsToISODate`: This utility function is defined in a separate file and converts a Unix timestamp to an ISO date string.

## Symbols
### `mapToBiometricsFromRespiration`
#### Description
This function takes raw respiration data from Garmin, processes it, and returns an array of `UserData&lt;Biometrics&gt;` objects. It groups the input data by user, extracts breath measurements, and organizes them by date to create `Biometrics` objects containing respiration samples.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| items | `GarminRespirationList` | An array of raw respiration data objects received from Garmin. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `UserData&lt;Biometrics&gt;[]` | An array of `UserData` objects, each containing a `Biometrics` object representing the processed respiration data for a specific user and date. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Group by User:** The function first groups the input `items` by the `userAccessToken` to separate data for different users.
2. **Extract Breaths:** For each user, it calls the `toBreaths` function to extract breath measurements from the raw data.
3. **Group by Date:** The extracted breaths are then grouped by date to organize them for storage in `Biometrics` objects.
4. **Create Biometrics:** For each date, a new `Biometrics` object is created with the extracted breath samples.
5. **Return UserData:** The function returns an array of `UserData` objects, each containing the user information and the corresponding `Biometrics` data.

### `toBreaths`
#### Description
This helper function processes raw respiration data from Garmin and extracts breath measurements, formatting them as an array of `BreathAndDate` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userData | `GarminRespirationList` | An array of raw respiration data objects for a single user. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `BreathAndDate[]` | An array of `BreathAndDate` objects, each containing the date, time, and value of a single breath measurement. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Iterate and Extract:** The function iterates through the input `userData` and extracts breath measurements from the `timeOffsetEpochToBreaths` property.
2. **Calculate Date and Time:** For each measurement, it calculates the date and time using the `startTimeInSeconds` and the time offset.
3. **Format Output:** The extracted breath data is then formatted as an array of `BreathAndDate` objects.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides the `Biometrics` interface for standardized biometrics data. |
| dayjs | Used for date and time manipulation. |
| lodash (groupBy) | Used for grouping data by specific properties. |
| zod | Used for data validation and type inference. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Any errors encountered during data processing will be propagated up the call stack.
