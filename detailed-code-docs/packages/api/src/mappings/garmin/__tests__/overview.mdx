## High-level description
This code defines unit tests for the `activityTypeReadable` function, which is responsible for converting Garmin activity type codes into human-readable strings. The tests cover various scenarios, including known activity types, unknown types with different suffixes, and unknown types with multiple words.

## References
- `activityTypeReadable`: This function is defined in the `../activity-types` module.

## Symbols
### `describe`
#### Description
This block defines a test suite named "garmin activity types" using the `jest` testing framework. It contains multiple test cases to verify the behavior of the `activityTypeReadable` function.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `describe` block groups together several `test` blocks, each representing a specific test case. Each test case calls the `activityTypeReadable` function with a specific input and uses `expect` assertions to verify the output.

### `test`
#### Description
Each `test` block represents a single unit test within the "garmin activity types" test suite. 

#### Inputs
- **First argument:** A string describing the test case.
- **Second argument:** An asynchronous callback function that contains the test logic.

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
Each test case within the callback function follows the arrange-act-assert pattern:
- **Arrange:** No specific setup is performed in these tests.
- **Act:** The `activityTypeReadable` function is called with a specific Garmin activity type code.
- **Assert:** The `expect` assertion is used to verify that the function's return value matches the expected human-readable string.

For example, the first test case checks if the input "RESORT_SKIING_SNOWBOARDING_WS" correctly returns "Resort skiing/snowboarding".

## Dependencies
- **jest:** This testing framework is used to define and run the tests.

## Error Handling
The tests themselves don't implement specific error handling. If the `activityTypeReadable` function throws an error, the test will fail, and the error message will be reported by the testing framework.
