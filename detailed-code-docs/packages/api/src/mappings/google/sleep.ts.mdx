## High-level description
This code defines a function `mapToSleep` that transforms raw sleep data from Google Fit (represented by the `GoogleSleep` type) into a standardized `Sleep` object used within the application. This transformation involves extracting relevant sleep session data, calculating durations, and applying specific logic to handle potential gaps between sleep samples.

## Code Structure
The `mapToSleep` function is the core of this code. It utilizes the `GoogleSleep` type as input and relies on constants like `PROVIDER_GOOGLE` and `maxTimeBetweenSleepSamples` for data processing. The function also leverages the `dayjs` library for date and time manipulations.

## Symbols

### `mapToSleep`
#### Description
This function transforms raw sleep data from Google Fit into a standardized `Sleep` object. It processes sleep sessions, calculates total sleep duration, and handles potential gaps between sleep samples based on a predefined maximum time difference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| googleSleep | `GoogleSleep` | Raw sleep data retrieved from Google Fit. |
| date | `string` | Date string representing the day the sleep data belongs to. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sleep | `Sleep` | Transformed sleep data in a standardized format. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Creates a `metadata` object containing the date and source of the sleep data.
   - Initializes an empty `sleep` object with the `metadata`.
2. **Session Processing:**
   - Checks if any sleep sessions exist in `googleSleep.session`. If not, returns the basic `sleep` object.
   - Iterates through the `googleSleep.session` array using `reduce` to process each session:
     - If there's a previous session, calculates the time difference between the current session's start and the previous session's end.
     - If the time difference exceeds `maxTimeBetweenSleepSamples`, considers it a new sleep session and skips the current iteration.
     - Extracts start and end times from the current session, converts them to ISO format, and pushes them into an accumulator array.
   - Assigns the start time of the first session and the end time of the last session to the `sleep` object.
3. **Duration Calculation:**
   - Calculates the total sleep duration in seconds using the `start_time` and `end_time` of the processed sleep sessions.
4. **Return:**
   - Returns the fully populated `sleep` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides the `Sleep` type definition. |
| dayjs | Used for date and time parsing, manipulation, and formatting. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. It assumes the input data is in the expected format.
