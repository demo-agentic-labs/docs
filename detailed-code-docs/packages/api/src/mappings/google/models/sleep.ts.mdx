## High-level description
This code defines types and constants related to sleep data fetched from Google Fit API. It defines the `GoogleSleep` type which represents the structure of sleep data and a constant `sessionSleepType` used to identify sleep sessions.

## References
- `sessionResp` from `.` (local file)

## Symbols
### `GoogleSleep`
#### Description
This type represents the expected structure of sleep data returned by the Google Fit API. It is inferred from the `sessionResp` type using `z.infer`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This is a type alias, it doesn't have internal logic. It relies on the `sessionResp` type for its structure.

### `sessionSleepType`
#### Description
A constant representing the activity type code used by Google Fit to identify sleep sessions.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a constant.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a constant.

#### Internal Logic
This constant is assigned the value `72`, which represents the sleep activity type in Google Fit's data model. This value is used to filter and process sleep-related data from the API.
