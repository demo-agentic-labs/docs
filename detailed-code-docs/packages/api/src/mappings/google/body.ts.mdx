## High-level description
The code defines a function `mapToBody` that transforms raw body data retrieved from Google Fit API into a standardized `Body` object as defined in the `@metriport/api-sdk`. This transformation involves extracting relevant data points like weight, height, and body fat percentage, applying unit conversions where necessary, and packaging them into the `Body` object along with metadata like the date and source of the data.

## References
- `Body`: This symbol is referenced from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package and defines the structure of the standardized body data object.
- `PROVIDER_GOOGLE`: A constant imported from shared constants, indicating Google as the data source.
- `GoogleBody`, `sourceIdBodyFat`, `sourceIdHeight`, `sourceIdWeight`: These symbols are specific to the Google Fit data model and are used to parse the raw data.
- `getValues`: A utility function, likely defined in the same module, used to extract specific values from the Google Fit data structure.
- `Util`: A utility class providing helper functions, in this case, `getAvgOfArr` is used to calculate the average body fat percentage.

## Symbols

### `mapToBody`
#### Description
This function transforms raw body data from Google Fit into a standardized `Body` object. It iterates through the data points, identifies the data type based on `dataSourceId`, extracts the value, performs unit conversions if needed (e.g., meters to centimeters for height), and populates the corresponding fields in the `Body` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| googleBody | `GoogleBody` | Raw body data received from the Google Fit API. |
| date | `string` | The date associated with the provided body data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | `Body` | A standardized body data object containing extracted and processed information from the raw Google Fit data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an empty `Body` object and sets its metadata with the provided `date` and `PROVIDER_GOOGLE` as the source.
2. Iterates through each dataset within the `googleBody.bucket[0].dataset` array.
3. For each dataset, it checks if data points exist (`data.point.length`).
4. Identifies the data type using `data.dataSourceId` and extracts the value from `data.point[0].value[0].fpVal`.
5. Performs unit conversion for height from meters to centimeters using the `convert` library.
6. For body fat percentage, it uses the `getValues` utility function to extract relevant values and calculates the average using `Util.getAvgOfArr`.
7. Populates the corresponding fields in the `Body` object: `weight_kg`, `height_cm`, and `body_fat_pct`.
8. Returns the populated `Body` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides the standardized `Body` data structure. |
| convert-units | Used for unit conversion, specifically from meters to centimeters for height. |
| dayjs | Potentially used for date manipulation, although not directly utilized in the provided code snippet. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. It assumes the input data is in the expected format. 

## Logging
The code does not include any logging mechanisms.
