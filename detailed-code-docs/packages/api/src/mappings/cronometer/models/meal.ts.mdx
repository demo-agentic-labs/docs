## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript types for representing meal data returned by the Cronometer API. It uses the `zod` library for schema validation and type inference. 

## Code Structure
The code defines a `cronometerMealResp` schema using `zod` to validate the structure and types of meal data received from the Cronometer API. It also defines a `CronometerMeal` type alias using `zod`'s type inference to represent the validated meal data as a TypeScript type.

## References
- `cronometerMacrosResp`: This symbol, likely defined in `./macros.ts`, represents the schema for macro nutrient data associated with a meal.

## Symbols

### `cronometerMealResp`
#### Description
This symbol is a `zod` schema that defines the expected structure and types for a meal response from the Cronometer API.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (implicit) | `z.ZodObject` | A `zod` object schema representing a Cronometer meal response. |

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following properties for a meal:
- `name`: A required string representing the name of the meal.
- `foods`: A required array of objects, where each object represents a food item in the meal. Each food object has:
    - `name`: A required string representing the name of the food.
    - `serving`: A required string representing the serving size of the food.
- `macros`: A required object adhering to the `cronometerMacrosResp` schema, representing the macronutrient breakdown of the meal.

### `CronometerMeal`
#### Description
This symbol is a type alias that leverages `zod`'s type inference to represent the validated Cronometer meal data as a TypeScript type.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (implicit) | `z.infer&lt;typeof cronometerMealResp&gt;` | A TypeScript type representing a validated Cronometer meal object. |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for schema validation and type inference of the Cronometer API responses. |
