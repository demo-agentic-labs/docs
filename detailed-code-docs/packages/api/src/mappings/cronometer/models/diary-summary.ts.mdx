## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript type, `CronometerDiarySummary`, which represents the structure of a diary summary response from the Cronometer API. It uses the `zod` library for validation and type inference.

## References
- `cronometerMacrosResp`: Represents the structure of macro nutrients in the response.
- `cronometerMealResp`: Represents the structure of a meal in the response.

## Symbols

### `cronometerDiarySummaryResp`
#### Description
A `zod` object model that defines the structure and types for a diary summary response from the Cronometer API.

#### Inputs
This is a constant object definition, it does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The object model specifies the expected fields and their types for a Cronometer diary summary. It includes fields like:
- `completed`: A boolean indicating if the diary is marked as completed.
- `day`: A string representing the date of the diary summary.
- `food_grams`: A number representing the total grams of food consumed.
- `foods`: An optional array of `cronometerMealResp` objects, representing the meals logged.
- `macros`: A `cronometerMacrosResp` object representing the macronutrient breakdown.
- `metrics`: An array of unspecified objects, potentially representing additional metrics.
- `nutrients`: An object containing detailed nutrient information with their respective values.

### `CronometerDiarySummary`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias that infers the type from the `cronometerDiarySummaryResp` zod object model. This provides type safety when working with data that conforms to the defined structure.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

## Dependencies
- `zod`: Used for schema validation and type inference.

- `cronometerMacrosResp`:  Defined in `./models/macros.ts`.
- `cronometerMealResp`: Defined in `./models/meal.ts`.
