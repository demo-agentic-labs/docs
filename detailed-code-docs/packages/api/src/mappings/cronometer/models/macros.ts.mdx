## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript type, `CronometerMacros`, to represent the structure of macro nutrient data returned by the Cronometer API's `/diary_summary` endpoint. It uses the `zod` library for type validation and parsing.

## Symbols

### `cronometerMacrosResp`
#### Description
This symbol is a `zod` schema that defines the expected structure of the JSON response from the Cronometer API's `/diary_summary` endpoint, specifically for macro nutrient data. Each key in the object represents a macro nutrient and its corresponding value is expected to be a number.

#### Inputs
This is a constant value and does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a constant value and does not return any outputs. It defines a `zod` schema.

### `CronometerMacros`
#### Description
This symbol is a TypeScript type alias that infers the type from the `cronometerMacrosResp` zod schema. It represents the shape of the macro nutrient data returned by the Cronometer API.

#### Inputs
This is a type alias and does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a type alias and does not return any outputs. It defines a TypeScript type.
