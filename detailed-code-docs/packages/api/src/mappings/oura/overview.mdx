## High-level description
This directory contains modules responsible for mapping data from the Oura API to standardized Metriport formats. It includes mappings for activity, biometrics, body metrics, sleep data, and user information. The code is designed to transform raw Oura data into a consistent format that can be used across the Metriport platform.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs the following main functions:

1. Transforms activity data from Oura, including daily activity, sessions, and workouts, into a standardized Metriport Activity format.
2. Converts heart rate data from Oura into Metriport Biometrics format, calculating various heart rate statistics.
3. Maps Oura personal information (height and weight) to a standardized Body object.
4. Transforms Oura sleep data into Metriport Sleep format, including sleep durations, heart rate variability, respiration, and heart rate data.
5. Converts Oura user personal information into the Metriport User model.
6. Defines schemas for validating the structure of data received from the Oura API.

These transformations ensure that data from Oura can be seamlessly integrated into the Metriport system, allowing for consistent data handling and analysis across different data sources.

## Key Files

### activity.ts
This file contains the `mapToActivity` function, which is responsible for transforming Oura activity data into the Metriport Activity format. It handles daily activity, sessions, and workouts, combining them into a single standardized structure.

Key features:
- Transforms Oura daily activity, sessions, and workouts into Metriport Activity format.
- Calculates and includes heart rate data for activities when available.
- Combines multiple data sources (daily activity, sessions, workouts) into a single activity log.

### biometrics.ts
This file focuses on mapping Oura heart rate data to the Metriport Biometrics format. It includes functions for calculating various heart rate statistics and formatting heart rate samples.

Key features:
- Calculates minimum, maximum, average, and resting heart rates.
- Formats heart rate samples with timestamps.
- Transforms Oura heart rate data into the standardized Metriport Biometrics format.

### body.ts
This file contains the `mapToBody` function, which transforms Oura personal information (specifically height and weight) into a standardized Body object.

Key features:
- Converts height from meters to centimeters.
- Maps weight data directly (assuming Oura provides weight in kilograms).
- Adds metadata including the date and data source.

### sleep.ts
This file is responsible for mapping Oura sleep data to the Metriport Sleep format. It handles various aspects of sleep data, including durations, heart rate variability, respiration, and heart rate.

Key features:
- Extracts and calculates sleep durations (total, awake, deep, REM, light).
- Maps heart rate variability (HRV) data.
- Includes respiration data (average breaths per minute).
- Calculates and includes heart rate statistics and samples.
- Handles timestamp conversions and interval calculations for time-series data.

### user.ts
This file contains the `mapToUser` function, which transforms Oura personal information into the Metriport User model.

Key features:
- Maps age, email, and biological sex from Oura data to Metriport User format.
- Includes data validation using a Zod schema for Oura personal information.

### index.ts
This file defines a Zod schema for validating streaming data from the Oura API, ensuring that incoming data conforms to the expected structure.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @metriport/api-sdk: Provides type definitions for Metriport data models.
2. zod: Used for schema validation and type checking of Oura API responses.
3. dayjs: Utilized for date and time manipulation in sleep data mapping.
4. lodash: Used for mathematical operations like calculating means.
5. convert-units: Employed for unit conversions (e.g., meters to centimeters).

Internal dependencies include:
- ../../shared/constants: Provides constants like PROVIDER_OURA.
- ../../shared/util: Contains utility functions used across multiple mapping files.

## Configuration
The code does not use explicit configuration files or environment variables. However, it does rely on constants (like PROVIDER_OURA) defined in shared modules, which could be considered a form of configuration.

The mapping functions are designed to be flexible, handling optional fields and different data structures from the Oura API. This allows for some level of adaptability to changes in the Oura API response format without requiring code changes.

In summary, this directory contains a set of modules that form a crucial part of the data integration pipeline between Oura and Metriport. By standardizing the data format, it enables consistent data handling and analysis across the Metriport platform, regardless of the original data source.
