## High-level description
This code defines a function `mapToNutrition` that transforms Fitbit food and water data into the standardized `Nutrition` type used in the application. It extracts relevant information from Fitbit's data structures and maps them to corresponding fields in the `Nutrition` object, including macros, food details, and water intake.

## Symbols

### `mapToNutrition`
#### Description
This function takes Fitbit food and water data for a specific date and maps it to a `Nutrition` object, which represents nutritional information in a standardized format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | string | The date for which the nutrition data is being mapped (in YYYY-MM-DD format). |
| food | FitbitFood | An object containing Fitbit food data. |
| water | FitbitWater | An object containing Fitbit water consumption data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nutrition | Nutrition | A `Nutrition` object containing the mapped nutrition data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialize `Nutrition` object:**
   - Creates a `metadata` object with the provided `date` and `PROVIDER_FITBIT` as the source.
   - Initializes an empty `Nutrition` object with the `metadata` and an empty `foods` array. The `summary` object is initialized with an empty `macros` object.
2. **Process Food Data (if provided):**
   - If `food` data is provided:
     - Extracts macro nutrients (carbs, fat, fiber, protein, sodium) from `food.summary` and populates the `nutrition.summary.macros` object.
     - Iterates through each `foodItem` in `food.foods`:
       - Creates a `Food` object with details like `name`, `brand`, `amount`, and `unit`.
       - If `nutritionalValues` exist for the `foodItem`, it extracts and maps the macro nutrients to the `Food` object's `nutrition_facts.macros` object.
       - Pushes the created `Food` object to the `nutrition.foods` array.
3. **Process Water Data (if provided):**
   - If `water` data is provided:
     - Extracts total water consumption (`water.summary.water`) and adds it to the `nutrition.summary.macros` object as `water_ml`.
4. **Return `Nutrition` object:**
   - Returns the fully populated `Nutrition` object.

## References
- `Nutrition`: This type is referenced from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package, indicating a shared data model across the application.
- `PROVIDER_FITBIT`: A constant likely defining the string "Fitbit" to denote the data source.
- `FitbitFood`: A type representing Fitbit food data structure.
- `FitbitWater`: A type representing Fitbit water consumption data structure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides the standardized `Nutrition` type and potentially other shared data models. |
