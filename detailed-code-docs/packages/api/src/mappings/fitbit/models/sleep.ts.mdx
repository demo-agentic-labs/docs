## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema, `fitbitSleepResp`, to validate the structure and data types of Fitbit sleep data fetched from the Fitbit API. It also defines a corresponding TypeScript type, `FitbitSleep`, based on the schema.

## References
- This code references the `z` object from the "zod" library for schema definition and validation.

## Symbols

### `fitbitSleepResp`
#### Description
This symbol is a Zod schema that defines the expected structure and data types of a response from the Fitbit Sleep API. It ensures that the received data conforms to the defined schema, making the code more robust and less prone to errors from unexpected data.

#### Inputs
None. This is a constant Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. This is a constant Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the structure of the Fitbit sleep response, including:
- `sleep`: An array of sleep sessions, each containing details like date, duration, efficiency, sleep levels, etc.
- `summary`: A summary of the sleep data, including total time asleep, time in bed, and stages breakdown.

Each property within the schema is associated with a Zod type, such as `z.string()`, `z.number()`, `z.boolean()`, etc., to enforce data type validation.

### `FitbitSleep`
#### Description
This symbol is a TypeScript type alias that infers the type from the `fitbitSleepResp` Zod schema. It represents the validated shape of the Fitbit sleep data after it has been successfully parsed by the schema.

#### Inputs
None. This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. This is a type alias, not a function.

## Dependencies
- **zod:** Used for schema definition and validation.

## API/Interface Reference
This code doesn't expose an API. It defines data models for internal use.
