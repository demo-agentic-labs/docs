## High-level description
The code defines a Zod schema (`weightSchema`) to validate and type-check weight data retrieved from the Fitbit API. It also exports a type alias (`FitbitWeight`) representing the inferred type of the schema. This ensures that the data conforms to the expected structure and data types.

## References
- `z` from "zod": Used for defining the schema and inferring types.

### `weightSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that validates an array of objects, where each object represents a weight measurement from Fitbit.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields for each weight measurement:
- `bmi`: Optional number representing the calculated Body Mass Index.
- `date`: Optional string representing the date of the measurement.
- `fat`: Optional number representing the body fat percentage.
- `logId`: Optional number representing the log ID of the measurement.
- `source`: Required string indicating the source of the weight data (e.g., "API", "Aria").
- `time`: Required string representing the time of the measurement.
- `weight`: Required number representing the weight value.

### `FitbitWeight`
#### Description
A type alias representing the inferred type of the `weightSchema`. It's an array of objects, with each object adhering to the structure defined by the schema.

This type can be used for type annotations and ensures that the data conforms to the expected format for Fitbit weight measurements.
