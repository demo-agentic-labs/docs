## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript interface `FitbitBreathingRate` for representing breathing rate data retrieved from the Fitbit API. It uses the `zod` library for schema validation and type inference.

## References
- This code references the `fitbitBreathingRateResp` symbol, which is a Zod schema defined in the same file.

## Symbols
### `fitbitBreathingRateResp`
#### Description
This symbol is a Zod schema that validates the structure and types of the response object returned by the Fitbit API for breathing rate data. The schema ensures that the response has an optional `dateTime` property (a string) and an optional `breathingRate` property (a nullable and optional number).

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not return any outputs. It defines a Zod schema.

### `FitbitBreathingRate`
#### Description
This symbol is a TypeScript type inferred from the `fitbitBreathingRateResp` Zod schema. It represents the validated shape of the Fitbit breathing rate data.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not return any outputs. It defines a TypeScript type.
