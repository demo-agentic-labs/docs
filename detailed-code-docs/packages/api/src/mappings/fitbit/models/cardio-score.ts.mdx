## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript interface and a Zod schema for validating data returned from the Fitbit API endpoint that provides cardio fitness scores. The schema ensures the data conforms to the expected structure and types.

## References
- This code references the Zod library for schema definition and validation.
- It also references the `FitbitCardioScore` type, which is defined in the same file.

## Symbols

### `fitbitCardioScoreResp`
#### Description
This symbol is a Zod schema that validates the response from the Fitbit API endpoint for cardio fitness scores. It ensures the response has an optional object with `dateTime` and `value` properties. The `value` property is further validated to contain a `vo2Max` string.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not directly return any outputs. It is used to validate data.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following structure:
- An optional object
    - `dateTime`: A required string representing the date and time.
    - `value`: A required object containing:
        - `vo2Max`: A required string representing the VO2 Max value.

### `FitbitCardioScore`
#### Description
This symbol is a TypeScript type alias that represents the inferred type from the `fitbitCardioScoreResp` Zod schema. It provides type safety for working with the validated cardio fitness score data.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not have any outputs. It is a type alias.
