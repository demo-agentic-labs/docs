title: "user.ts"

## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript interface named `FitbitUser` which represents the structure of user data fetched from the Fitbit API. It uses the `zod` library for schema validation and type inference.

## References
- This code is referenced by `packages/api/src/providers/fitbit.ts` and `packages/api/src/mappings/fitbit/body.ts`.

## Symbols
### `fitbitUserResp`
#### Description
This symbol is a `zod` schema that defines the expected structure and data types for the response received from the Fitbit API's `/profile` endpoint. It ensures that the response conforms to the defined schema, making the code more robust and predictable.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema meticulously defines each field and its corresponding type, including optional fields and nullable values. It also defines nested objects like `user` and `features` to accurately represent the hierarchical structure of the Fitbit API response.

### `FitbitUser`
#### Description
This symbol is a TypeScript type alias that infers the type from the `fitbitUserResp` schema using `z.infer`. This provides strong typing for the Fitbit user data, making it easier to work with and ensuring type safety throughout the codebase.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

## Dependencies
- **zod:** Used for schema validation and type inference.
