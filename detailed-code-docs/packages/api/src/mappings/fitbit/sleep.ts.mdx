## High-level description
The `mapToSleep` function transforms sleep data retrieved from the Fitbit API into the standardized `Sleep` object used within the application. It specifically focuses on extracting and converting data from the main sleep session identified in the Fitbit response.

## References
- `Sleep`: This symbol is referenced from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package, indicating its role in representing standardized sleep data.
- `PROVIDER_FITBIT`: A constant likely defining the Fitbit provider identifier, referenced from a shared constants file.
- `FitbitSleep`: Represents the raw sleep data structure as received from the Fitbit API.

## Symbols

### `mapToSleep`
#### Description
This function maps raw sleep data from Fitbit's API to a standardized `Sleep` object. It identifies the main sleep session from Fitbit's response and extracts relevant sleep stage durations, converting them to seconds.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `fitbitSleep` | `FitbitSleep` | Raw sleep data received from the Fitbit API. |
| `date` | `string` | Date string representing the day of the sleep data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | `Sleep` | A standardized `Sleep` object populated with data from the Fitbit response. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Creates a `metadata` object containing the date and source (Fitbit).
   - Initializes an empty `sleep` object of type `Sleep` with the `metadata`.
2. **Main Sleep Identification:**
   - Filters the `fitbitSleep.sleep` array to find the entry where `isMainSleep` is true.
3. **Data Extraction and Conversion:**
   - If a `mainSleep` session is found:
     - Populates the `sleep` object with `start_time` and `end_time`.
     - Extracts and converts durations from milliseconds and minutes to seconds for:
       - `total_seconds`
       - `awake_seconds`
       - `deep_seconds`
       - `rem_seconds`
       - `light_seconds`
       - `in_bed_seconds`
       - `time_to_fall_asleep_seconds`
4. **Return:** Returns the populated `sleep` object.

## TODOs
- **Multiple Sleeps:** The code currently only handles a single main sleep session. There's a TODO to address the potential for multiple sleep sessions in Fitbit data.
