## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript interface and related types for representing Dexcom Estimated Glucose Values (EGVs) data, using the Zod library for validation and type inference. It defines the structure of individual EGV records and the overall response structure from the Dexcom API.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main Zod schemas: `recordSchema` for individual EGV records and `dexcomEvgsResp` for the overall API response containing an array of records. It also defines corresponding TypeScript types for these schemas using `z.infer`.

## References
- `dexcomResp` and `baseRecordSchema` are imported from a local module, likely defining common response structures for the Dexcom API.

## Symbols

### `recordSchema`
#### Description
Defines the schema for a single EGV record in the Dexcom API response. It includes fields like `transmitterId`, `value`, `trend`, etc., along with their data types and optional/nullable properties.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
Uses Zod's chaining API to define the schema:
- Starts with an object containing fields specific to EGV records.
- Merges with `baseRecordSchema` (imported), likely containing common fields for all Dexcom records.
- Each field is defined with its type and optional modifiers like `nullable()` or `optional()`.

### `Record`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias representing a single EGV record, inferred from the `recordSchema` using `z.infer`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias.

### `dexcomEvgsResp`
#### Description
Defines the schema for the overall Dexcom API response containing EGV data. It includes an array of `records` validated against the `recordSchema`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- Merges with `dexcomResp` (imported), likely containing common response fields.
- Adds a `records` field, defined as an array of objects validated against `recordSchema`.

### `DexcomEvgs`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias representing the entire Dexcom EGV API response, inferred from the `dexcomEvgsResp` schema.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias.
