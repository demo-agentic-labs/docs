## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types for Dexcom event records and API responses using the Zod library for schema validation. These types represent data structures for events retrieved from the Dexcom API, such as carbohydrate intake.

## Code Structure
The code defines two Zod schemas: `eventRecordSchema` for individual event records and `dexcomEventsResp` for the overall API response containing an array of event records. These schemas are used to create corresponding TypeScript types: `EventRecord` and `DexcomEvents`.

## References
- `dexcomResp`, `baseRecordSchema` - Imported from a local module, likely defining common Dexcom API response structures.

## Symbols

### `eventRecordSchema`
#### Description
Defines the Zod schema for validating a single Dexcom event record. It includes fields like event type, value, unit, and transmitter ID.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema uses `z.object` to define the structure and `z.string`, `z.nullable`, and `z.optional` to specify field types and constraints. It also merges with `baseRecordSchema` to include common record fields.

### `EventRecord`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias representing a Dexcom event record, inferred from the `eventRecordSchema`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

### `dexcomEventsResp`
#### Description
Defines the Zod schema for validating the Dexcom API response containing event records. It includes a `records` field, which is an array of `eventRecordSchema`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema merges the base `dexcomResp` with an object containing the `records` field, ensuring the response conforms to the expected structure.

### `DexcomEvents`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias representing the Dexcom API response for events, inferred from the `dexcomEventsResp` schema.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.
