## High-level description
The `mapToNutrition` function extracts nutrition data, specifically carbohydrate intake, from Dexcom biometrics events and maps it to a `Nutrition` object. This object is used to represent nutrition information retrieved from the Dexcom API.

## References
- `Nutrition`: This symbol is referenced from the `@metriport/api-sdk` package.
- `DexcomEvents`: This symbol is defined in the `./models/events` file.
- `PROVIDER_DEXCOM`: This symbol is defined in the `../../shared/constants` file.

## Symbols

### `mapToNutrition`
#### Description
This function processes raw biometrics data received from the Dexcom API and transforms it into a standardized `Nutrition` object. It specifically extracts carbohydrate intake information from the Dexcom events.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dexcomBiometrics | `DexcomEvents` | Raw biometrics data received from the Dexcom API, containing various events including carbohydrate intake. |
| date | `string` | The date for which the nutrition data is being extracted, in ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nutrition | `Nutrition` | A standardized object representing the extracted nutrition information, including total carbohydrate intake for the given date. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Metadata Initialization:** Creates a metadata object containing the date and source of the data (`PROVIDER_DEXCOM`).
2. **Carbohydrate Extraction:** 
    - Filters the `dexcomBiometrics.records` array to only include events of type "carbs".
    - Extracts the `value` property (representing carbohydrate intake) from each carb event and converts it to a number.
3. **Nutrition Object Creation:**
    - Creates a `Nutrition` object with the initialized metadata.
    - Calculates the total carbohydrate intake by summing up the values extracted in step 2.
    - Populates the `macros.carbs_g` property of the `Nutrition` object with the calculated total carbohydrate intake.
4. **Return:** Returns the constructed `Nutrition` object.
