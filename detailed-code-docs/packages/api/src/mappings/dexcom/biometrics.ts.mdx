## High-level description
The `mapToBiometrics` function transforms raw biometrics data received from the Dexcom API into a standardized `Biometrics` object used within the application. It specifically extracts and processes blood glucose data, calculating the average blood glucose level and formatting the data into the required structure.

## References
- `Biometrics`: This symbol references the `Biometrics` interface defined in `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/biometrics.ts`.
- `DexcomEvgs`: This symbol references the `DexcomEvgs` type defined in `packages/api/src/mappings/dexcom/models/evgs.ts`, representing the structure of the raw data received from the Dexcom API.
- `PROVIDER_DEXCOM`: This symbol references a constant defined in `../../shared/constants`, likely representing the string identifier for the Dexcom provider.
- `Util`: This symbol references a utility module defined in `../../shared/util`, specifically using its `getAvgOfArr` function.

## Symbols

### `mapToBiometrics`
#### Description
This function maps raw biometrics data from Dexcom's API (represented by the `DexcomEvgs` type) into a standardized `Biometrics` object. It focuses on extracting and processing blood glucose information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dexcomBiometrics | `DexcomEvgs` | Raw biometrics data received from the Dexcom API. |
| date | `string` | The date for which the biometrics data is being processed. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| biometrics | `Biometrics` | A standardized object containing the processed blood glucose data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Metadata Creation:**
   - Constructs a `metadata` object containing the `date` and the `PROVIDER_DEXCOM` constant as the `source`.
2. **Biometrics Object Initialization:**
   - Creates a `biometrics` object of type `Biometrics` and assigns the created `metadata` to it.
3. **Blood Glucose Samples Extraction:**
   - Iterates through the `records` array within the `dexcomBiometrics` object.
   - For each record with a non-null `value`, it extracts the `displayTime` as `time` and the `value` itself, pushing these into the `samples` array.
4. **Blood Glucose Value Conversion and Accumulation:**
   - Iterates through the `records` array again.
   - For each record with a non-null `value`:
     - If the `unit` is "mg/dL", the `value` is directly pushed into the `mgDlValues` array.
     - If the `unit` is "mmol/L", the `value` is converted to "mg/dL" using a conversion factor before being pushed into the `mgDlValues` array.
5. **Blood Glucose Data Population:**
   - Assigns the extracted `samples` to `biometrics.blood_glucose.samples_mg_dL`.
   - Calculates the average of the `mgDlValues` using the `Util.getAvgOfArr` function and assigns it to `biometrics.blood_glucose.avg_mg_dL`.
6. **Return:**
   - Returns the populated `biometrics` object.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following external libraries or modules:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@metriport/api-sdk` | Provides the `Biometrics` interface. |
| `dayjs` | Used for date manipulation. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond potential errors thrown by the `zod` schema validation within the `dexcomEvgsResp.parse` call.
