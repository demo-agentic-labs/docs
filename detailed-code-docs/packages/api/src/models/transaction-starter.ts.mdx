## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `startTransaction` that initiates a database transaction using Sequelize ORM. It's designed to work with models that extend the `BaseModelNoId` class, ensuring that a transaction can be started for any compatible model.

## Symbols

### `startTransaction`
#### Description
This asynchronous function starts a new database transaction using the Sequelize ORM. It takes a model instance as input and returns a Promise that resolves to a Sequelize Transaction object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | BaseModelNoId&lt;T&gt; | An instance of a model that extends BaseModelNoId |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Transaction | Promise&lt;Transaction&gt; | A Promise that resolves to a Sequelize Transaction object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function first retrieves the `sequelize` instance associated with the provided model.
2. It checks if the `sequelize` instance exists, throwing an error if it's missing.
3. If the `sequelize` instance is present, it calls the `transaction()` method to start a new transaction.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides the Model and Transaction types used in the function signature |

## Error Handling
The function implements basic error handling by throwing an error if the `sequelize` instance is missing from the model. This ensures that the transaction can only be started when a valid database connection is available.

## References
The code references the `BaseModelNoId` class, which is defined in the related file `packages/api/src/models/_default.ts`. This class extends Sequelize's `Model` class and provides a base structure for models without an ID field.

## Performance Considerations
Starting a transaction is generally a lightweight operation, but it's important to note that holding a transaction open for an extended period can impact database performance. Users of this function should ensure that transactions are committed or rolled back in a timely manner.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
