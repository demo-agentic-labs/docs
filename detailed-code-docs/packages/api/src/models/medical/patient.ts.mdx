## High-level description
This code defines the `PatientModel` class, which represents a patient in the system. It extends the `BaseModel` class and implements the `Patient` interface. The model includes fields for customer ID, facility IDs, external ID, and patient data. It also provides a setup method for initializing the model with Sequelize.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are:
- `PatientModel`: The main class representing a patient.
- `BaseModel`: The parent class that `PatientModel` extends.
- `Patient`: The interface that `PatientModel` implements.
- `setup`: A static method for initializing the model with Sequelize.

## Symbols

### PatientModel
#### Description
This class represents a patient in the system. It extends `BaseModel` and implements the `Patient` interface.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several fields:
- `cxId`: The customer ID (UUID).
- `facilityIds`: An array of facility IDs.
- `externalId`: An optional external ID.
- `data`: Patient data of type `PatientData`.

The `setup` method initializes the model with Sequelize, defining the table structure and options.

### setup
#### Description
A static method that initializes the `PatientModel` with Sequelize.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequelize | Sequelize | The Sequelize instance |

#### Internal Logic
This method calls `PatientModel.init()` to set up the model's attributes and options. It defines the table structure, including fields for `cxId`, `facilityIds`, `externalId`, and `data`. The method also sets the table name and inherits options from `BaseModel`.

## Dependencies
The code imports from the following libraries:
- `sequelize`: For database ORM functionality.
- `@metriport/core/domain/patient`: For patient-related types and interfaces.
- `../default`: For the `BaseModel` class and `ModelSetup` type.
