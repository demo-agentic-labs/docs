## High-level description
This code defines the `OrganizationModel` class, which represents an organization in the Metriport system. It extends the `BaseModel` class and implements the `Organization` interface. The model includes various attributes such as customer ID, organization ID, organization number, type, data, and activation statuses for different services.

## Code Structure
The `OrganizationModel` class is the main symbol in this code. It extends `BaseModel` and implements the `Organization` interface. The class defines the structure and attributes of an organization in the system, including static methods for setting up the model with Sequelize.

## Symbols

### OrganizationModel
#### Description
This class represents an organization in the Metriport system. It extends the `BaseModel` class and implements the `Organization` interface, providing a structure for storing and managing organization data.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several attributes:
- `cxId`: Customer ID (UUID)
- `oid`: Organization ID (string)
- `organizationNumber`: A unique integer identifier for the organization
- `type`: The business type of the organization (enum)
- `data`: Additional organization data (JSON)
- `cqActive`, `cwActive`, `cqApproved`, `cwApproved`: Boolean flags for service activation status

The `setup` static method initializes the model with Sequelize, defining the table structure and options.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/organization | Imports organization-related types and interfaces |
| sequelize | ORM for database interactions |
| ../../models/_default | Imports base model classes and utilities |

## Configuration
The model is configured using Sequelize's `init` method, which defines the table structure and options. The table name is set to "organization".

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| cxId | UUID | - | Customer ID |
| oid | STRING | - | Organization ID |
| organizationNumber | INTEGER | - | Unique organization number |
| type | ENUM | healthcareProvider | Business type of the organization |
| data | JSONB | - | Additional organization data |
| cqActive | BOOLEAN | false | CareQuality active status |
| cwActive | BOOLEAN | false | CommonWell active status |
| cqApproved | BOOLEAN | false | CareQuality approved status |
| cwApproved | BOOLEAN | false | CommonWell approved status |

The model uses the `BaseModel.modelOptions` for additional Sequelize configuration.
