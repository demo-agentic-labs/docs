## High-level description
This code defines the `WebhookRequest` model, which represents a webhook request in the system. It extends the `BaseModel` class and includes properties such as `id`, `cxId`, `requestId`, `type`, `payload`, `status`, and other related information. The model is set up with Sequelize ORM and includes methods for initializing the model with its attributes and options.

## Code Structure
The `WebhookRequest` class extends `BaseModel` and defines the structure and behavior of webhook requests. It includes static properties and methods for setting up the model with Sequelize.

## Symbols

### WebhookRequest
#### Description
This class represents a webhook request in the system. It extends the `BaseModel` class and defines the structure of a webhook request.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class definition)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class definition)

#### Internal Logic
- Defines properties such as `id`, `cxId`, `requestId`, `type`, `payload`, `status`, etc.
- Implements a static `setup` method to initialize the model with Sequelize.

### WebhookRequest.setup
#### Description
This static method sets up the `WebhookRequest` model with Sequelize ORM.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequelize | Sequelize | Sequelize instance |

#### Outputs
N/A (This method initializes the model)

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `WebhookRequest.init()` to initialize the model with its attributes and options.
- Sets up the table name and model options.

## Dependencies
- `sequelize`: Used for ORM functionality.
- `WebhookRequestStatus`: Imported from "../domain/webhook" to define the status type.
- `BaseModel`, `ModelSetup`: Imported from "./_default" for base model functionality.

## Configuration
The model is configured with the following attributes:
- `id`: UUID, primary key
- `cxId`: String
- `requestId`: Optional string
- `type`: String
- `payload`: JSONB object
- `status`: String (WebhookRequestStatus)
- `statusDetail`: Optional string
- `requestUrl`: Optional string
- `httpStatus`: Optional integer
- `durationMillis`: Optional integer

The table name is set to "webhook_request".

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in this file. Error handling would typically be managed when interacting with the model in other parts of the application.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this file.

This model is crucial for storing and managing webhook requests in the system, allowing for tracking of webhook statuses, payloads, and related information.
