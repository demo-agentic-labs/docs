## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `mockStartTransaction` for mocking database transactions in Jest tests. It creates a mock transaction object with commit, rollback, and afterCommit methods, and replaces the `startTransaction` function from the `transaction-starter` module with this mock.

## Symbols

### `mockStartTransaction`
#### Description
This function creates a mock transaction object and replaces the `startTransaction` function with a Jest mock that resolves to this mock transaction.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mockFunction | jest.SpyInstance | A Jest spy instance that can be used to verify if the mock function was called |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock transaction object with `commit`, `rollback`, and `afterCommit` methods as Jest mock functions.
2. Uses `jest.spyOn` to mock the `startTransaction` function from the `transaction-starter` module.
3. Sets up the mock to resolve with the created mock transaction object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Provides the Transaction type |
| jest | Used for mocking and spying on functions |

## References
This utility function is used in various test files across the project to mock database transactions. It's particularly useful in tests that involve database operations or need to simulate transaction behavior.

The `mockStartTransaction` function is commonly used in test setup to ensure that database transactions are properly mocked for the duration of the tests. This allows for isolated testing of database-related functionality without actually performing real transactions.
