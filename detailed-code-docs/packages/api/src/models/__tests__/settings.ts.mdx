## High-level description
This code defines a test utility function `makeSettingModel` for creating mock `Settings` objects in unit tests. It imports and uses a `makeSetting` function from a test helper file and casts the result to the `Settings` type.

## Symbols

### `makeSettingModel`
#### Description
This function creates a mock `Settings` object for use in unit tests. It wraps the `makeSetting` function from a test helper and ensures the return type is `Settings`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | object | An object containing the id of the setting to be created |
| params.id | string | The id for the mock Setting object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | Settings | A mock Settings object |

#### Internal Logic
The function calls `makeSetting` with the provided parameters and then casts the result to the `Settings` type. This ensures that the returned object conforms to the `Settings` model structure.

## References
- `makeSetting`: Imported from "../../domain/__tests__/settings"
- `Settings`: Imported from "../settings"

## Dependencies
The code relies on two main dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "../../domain/__tests__/settings" | Provides the `makeSetting` function for creating mock settings |
| "../settings" | Provides the `Settings` type definition |

## Notes
1. This file is located in a `__tests__` directory, indicating it's specifically for testing purposes.
2. The `makeSettingModel` function is likely used across multiple test files to create consistent mock `Settings` objects.
3. The actual implementation of `makeSetting` is not provided in this file, but it's assumed to create a mock object with properties matching the `Settings` model.
4. The casting to `Settings` type suggests that `makeSetting` might return a more generic object that needs to be explicitly typed as `Settings` for use in tests.

By providing this utility function, the code promotes consistency and reduces duplication in test files that need to create mock `Settings` objects.
