## High-level description
This code defines a Sequelize model for a FeedbackEntry, which represents a single feedback entry in a database. It extends a BaseModel and implements the FeedbackEntry interface, providing structure for storing and managing feedback data.

## Code Structure
The `FeedbackEntryModel` class extends `BaseModel` and implements `FeedbackEntry`. It defines the structure of the feedback entry table in the database, including fields like `feedbackId`, `comment`, and `authorName`. The `setup` static method initializes the model with Sequelize.

## References
- `BaseModel` from "./_default"
- `FeedbackEntry` from "../domain/feedback"
- `Sequelize` and `DataTypes` from "sequelize"

## Symbols

### `FeedbackEntryModel`
#### Description
This class represents the Sequelize model for a feedback entry. It extends `BaseModel` and implements the `FeedbackEntry` interface, defining the structure and behavior of feedback entries in the database.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class definition, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class definition, not a function)

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines `NAME` as a static property with the value "feedback_entry".
2. Declares properties `feedbackId`, `comment`, and `authorName`.
3. Implements a static `setup` method to initialize the model with Sequelize.

#### Performance Considerations
The model uses UUID for the `feedbackId`, which can have performance implications for large datasets compared to auto-incrementing integers.

### `FeedbackEntryModel.setup`
#### Description
This static method initializes the FeedbackEntryModel with Sequelize, defining the table structure and options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequelize | Sequelize | The Sequelize instance to use for initialization |

#### Outputs
N/A (This method initializes the model but doesn't return a value)

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `FeedbackEntryModel.init()` with two arguments:
   - An object defining the model's attributes, combining base attributes and specific fields for FeedbackEntry.
   - An object with model options, including the table name.
2. Uses `BaseModel.attributes()` and `BaseModel.modelOptions()` to include common fields and options.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | ORM for database interactions |

## Configuration
The model uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| tableName | string | "feedback_entry" | The name of the database table for this model |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement specific error handling. Error management would typically be handled by Sequelize and the application using this model.

## API/Interface Reference
The `FeedbackEntryModel` provides the following fields:
| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| feedbackId | UUID | The ID of the associated feedback |
| comment | STRING | The feedback comment |
| authorName | STRING | The name of the feedback author (optional) |

Note: The model also includes fields inherited from `BaseModel`, such as `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
