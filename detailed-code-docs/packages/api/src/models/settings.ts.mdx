## High-level description
This code defines a Sequelize model for the Settings table, which stores configuration settings for webhooks. It includes fields for webhook URL, key, enabled status, and status details. The model is used to manage and persist webhook-related settings for different customers or accounts in the application.

## Code Structure
The `Settings` class extends `BaseModel`, inheriting common attributes and methods. It defines specific fields related to webhook configuration and provides a static `setup` method for initializing the model with Sequelize.

- Provides a static `setup` method to initialize the model with Sequelize, defining the table structure and options.

### DATE_FORMAT
#### Description
A constant defining the date format used in the application.

| N/A | string | The value is "OK" |

### WEBHOOK_STATUS_BAD_RESPONSE

## Dependencies
The code imports from the following external libraries and internal modules:
- `sequelize`: For ORM functionality
- `./_default`: For base model and model setup types

## Configuration
The model is configured with the following options:
- Table name: "settings"
- Timestamps: Enabled (inherited from BaseModel)
- Underscored: true (inherited from BaseModel)
- Freezed table name: true (inherited from BaseModel)

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in this file. Error handling is likely managed at a higher level in the application.

## API/Interface Reference
The `Settings` model provides the following fields:
- `id`: UUID (inherited from BaseModel)
- `webhookUrl`: STRING
- `webhookKey`: STRING
- `webhookEnabled`: BOOLEAN
- `webhookStatusDetail`: STRING

These fields can be used to query, create, and update settings records in the database.
