## High-level description
This code defines a function `executeOnDBTx` that executes a callback within a database transaction. It's designed to handle database operations safely, ensuring that they are either completed entirely or rolled back in case of an error.

## Code Structure
The `executeOnDBTx` function is the main component of this file. It takes a model prototype and a callback function as parameters. The function starts a transaction, executes the callback, and handles the commit or rollback of the transaction based on the success or failure of the operation.

## Symbols

### `executeOnDBTx`
#### Description
This function executes a callback within a database transaction, ensuring atomicity of the operations performed in the callback.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | BaseModelNoId&lt;T&gt; | The model prototype to start the transaction on |
| callback | (tx: Transaction) =&gt; Promise&lt;X&gt; | The function to execute within the transaction |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;X&gt; | The result of the callback function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Start a transaction using the `startTransaction` function.
2. Execute the provided callback function with the transaction as an argument.
3. If the callback succeeds, commit the transaction.
4. If an error occurs, rollback the transaction and rethrow the error.
5. Ensure the transaction is committed in the finally block if it hasn't been already.

#### Performance Considerations
The function uses a try-catch-finally block to ensure proper handling of the transaction, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity but may have a slight performance overhead.

## Side Effects
- Starts, commits, or rolls back a database transaction.
- May modify database state based on the operations performed in the callback.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | For database operations and transaction handling |
| ./transaction-starter | Provides the `startTransaction` function |
| ./_default | Imports the `BaseModelNoId` type |

## Error Handling
The function catches any errors thrown during the execution of the callback. If an error occurs, it rolls back the transaction and re-throws the error.

## TODOs
- Add unit tests for this function.

This implementation provides a robust way to handle database transactions, ensuring that operations are atomic and maintaining data consistency in case of failures.
