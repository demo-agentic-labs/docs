## High-level description
This directory contains test utilities and test cases for the medical domain of the Metriport API. It includes functions for generating mock data, constants for testing, and unit tests for various components related to patient demographics, document references, facilities, organizations, and more.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves several purposes:

1. Mock Data Generation: It provides utility functions to create realistic mock data for various entities in the medical domain, such as patients, facilities, organizations, and addresses. This mock data is crucial for writing comprehensive unit tests.

2. Test Constants: It defines constant data structures that can be used across multiple tests, ensuring consistency in test scenarios.

3. Unit Tests: It contains actual test cases for various functions and components in the medical domain, verifying their behavior under different scenarios.

4. Test Utilities: It includes helper functions that simplify the process of setting up test scenarios and asserting expected outcomes.

These components work together to enable thorough testing of the medical domain functionality in the Metriport API, covering aspects like data normalization, demographic matching, facility status checking, and more.

## Key Files

1. `demographics.const.ts`: Defines constant data structures for patient demographics used in testing.

2. `docref-mapping.ts`: Provides utilities for creating test data for document reference mapping.

3. `document-query.ts`: Contains functions to generate mock data for document query progress.

4. `facility.test.ts`: Includes unit tests for facility-related functionality, particularly the `isFacilityActiveForHie` function.

5. `facility.ts`: Offers utilities for creating mock facility data.

6. `location-address.ts`: Provides functions to generate mock address data.

7. `organization.ts`: Contains utilities for creating mock organization data.

8. `patient-demographics.test.ts`: Includes comprehensive unit tests for patient demographics processing, including normalization, matching, and comparison.

9. `patient.ts`: Offers utilities for creating mock patient data and related objects.

These files collectively provide a robust testing framework for the medical domain of the Metriport API, ensuring that various components work correctly under different scenarios.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on several key dependencies:

1. `@faker-js/faker`: Used extensively for generating random, realistic test data.
2. `@metriport/shared`: Provides shared utilities and types used across the Metriport ecosystem.
3. `@metriport/core`: Contains core domain models and types for the Metriport API.
4. `dayjs`: Used for date manipulation in generating test data.
5. Jest: The testing framework used for writing and running the unit tests.

These dependencies enable the creation of comprehensive, realistic test scenarios and facilitate effective unit testing of the medical domain functionality.

Code snippets have been omitted for brevity, but the summary provides a comprehensive overview of the directory's contents and purpose.
