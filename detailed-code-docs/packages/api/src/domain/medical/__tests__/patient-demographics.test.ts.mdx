## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for various functions related to patient demographics normalization, matching, and comparison. It tests functions that handle data such as dates of birth, names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, driver's licenses, and social security numbers.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a series of Jest test suites, each focusing on a specific aspect of patient demographics processing. The main test suites include normalization, total patient normalization, augmented patient creation, and demographic comparison.

## Symbols

### `describe("normalization", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite covers the normalization of various patient demographic fields.

#### Internal Logic
It contains nested `describe` blocks for different types of data (e.g., date of birth, names, addresses) and uses `it` blocks to test specific scenarios for each data type.

### `describe("total patient normalization", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite checks the overall patient normalization process.

#### Internal Logic
It tests the `patientToNormalizedCoreDemographics` function to ensure it correctly normalizes all patient data.

### `describe("create augmented patient", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite verifies the creation of an augmented patient object with additional demographic information.

#### Internal Logic
It tests the `createAugmentedPatient` function to ensure it correctly adds consolidated link demographics to the patient object.

### `describe("link has new demographics", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite checks the functionality of detecting new demographic information in link data.

#### Internal Logic
It contains multiple `it` blocks testing different scenarios where new demographic information might be present, such as new date of birth, gender, names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, driver's licenses, and social security numbers.

### `describe("check demo function", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite verifies the demographic matching function.

#### Internal Logic
It tests various scenarios of demographic matching, including exact and partial matches for different combinations of demographic data. It uses a point system to determine if the match is sufficient.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Provides utility functions and types |
| @metriport/core/domain/patient | Provides patient-related types and functions |
| @metriport/core/domain/patient-demographics | Provides types for patient demographics |
| ./demographics.const | Provides constant values for testing |

## Error Handling
The tests don't explicitly handle errors but use Jest's assertion functions to check for expected outcomes.

## Performance Considerations
The tests focus on functionality rather than performance. However, the underlying functions being tested (e.g., `patientToNormalizedCoreDemographics`, `createAugmentedPatient`, `linkHasNewDemographics`, `checkDemoMatch`) should be optimized for performance in production use, especially when dealing with large datasets.
