## High-level description
This code provides functionality for handling patient demographics in a medical data system. It includes functions for normalizing, comparing, and augmenting patient demographic data, as well as checking for matches and new information between different sets of demographic data.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several functions that work together to process patient demographic data. The main functions include normalization of various demographic fields, creation of augmented patient data, checking for demographic matches, and identifying new demographic information.

## Symbols

### `checkDemoMatch`
#### Description
Evaluates whether the input linked demographics are similar enough to the Patient to be considered a usable "match".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coreDemographics | LinkDemographics | The patient core demographics |
| linkDemographics | LinkDemographics | The incoming link demographics from CQ or CW |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | \{ isMatched: boolean, comparison: LinkDemographicsComparison \| undefined \} | Boolean representing whether the link demographics match the patient, and the comparison object if yes |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a point system for different matching demographics. Each exact or partial match awards points, which are added to an overall score. The score must be higher than a given threshold to be considered a match.

### `patientToNormalizedCoreDemographics`
#### Description
Converts a Patient's demographics into a normalized and stringified core demographics payload.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The Patient @ Metriport |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coreDemographics | LinkDemographics | Core demographics representing the Patient's demographics |

#### Internal Logic
Normalizes and stringifies various demographic fields such as name, address, phone numbers, emails, and personal identifiers.

### `createAugmentedPatient`
#### Description
Adds current patient consolidated link demographics to the Patient's demographics to create the augmented Patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The Patient @ Metriport |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| augmentedPatient | Patient | Patient augmented with the consolidated link demographics |

#### Internal Logic
Combines the original patient data with new addresses, telephone numbers, and emails from the consolidated link demographics.

### `linkHasNewDemographics`
#### Description
Checks if the input link demographics has any new values compared to the patient core demographics and consolidated link demographics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coreDemographics | LinkDemographics | The patient core demographics |
| linkDemographics | LinkDemographics | The incoming link demographics from CQ or CW |
| consolidatedLinkDemographics | ConsolidatedLinkDemographics \| undefined | The patient consolidated link demographics history |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | \{ hasNewDemographics: boolean, comparison: LinkDemographicsComparison \| undefined \} | Boolean representing whether the link demographics has new values, and the comparison if yes |

#### Internal Logic
Compares each demographic field between the core, link, and consolidated demographics to identify new information.

### `getNewDemographics`
#### Description
Combines checkDemoMatch and linkHasNewDemographics to return the set of link demographics with usable new data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The Patient @ Metriport |
| links | LinkDemographics[] | The incoming link demographics from CQ or CW converted from their raw state |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| newDemographics | LinkDemographics[] | The set of link demographics that pass checkDemoMatch and pass linkHasNewDemographics |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Provides utility functions for data normalization |
| @metriport/core | Provides domain models and types |
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides schema definitions |
| dayjs | Date manipulation library |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising.

## Performance Considerations
The code involves multiple string manipulations and comparisons, which could potentially impact performance for large datasets. Consider optimizing these operations if processing large volumes of patient data.
