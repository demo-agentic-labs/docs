## High-level description
This file defines two TypeScript types, `Coding` and `CodeableConcept`, which represent structured medical codes and concepts used in healthcare data exchange. These types are fundamental building blocks for representing coded medical information in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data models.

## Code Structure
The file defines two main types:
1. `Coding`: Represents a single coded value
2. `CodeableConcept`: Represents a concept that may include multiple codings and a text description

These types are designed to be used together, with `CodeableConcept` potentially containing an array of `Coding` objects.

## Symbols

### Coding
#### Description
Represents a single coded value, typically from a specific coding system.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| system | string \| null \| undefined | The coding system (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC) |
| code | string \| null \| undefined | The code value within the system |
| display | string \| null \| undefined | Human-readable representation of the code |

### CodeableConcept
#### Description
Represents a concept that may be coded in multiple ways and include a text description.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
| coding | Coding[] \| undefined | Array of Coding objects representing the concept |
| text | string \| null \| undefined | Plain text representation of the concept |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Notes
These types are commonly used throughout FHIR resources to represent coded medical information in a standardized way. They allow for flexibility in representing concepts that may have multiple codings from different systems while also providing a human-readable text description.
