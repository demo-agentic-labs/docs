## High-level description
This file contains utility functions for managing the association between patients and facilities in a medical system. It provides functions to check patient-facility associations, retrieve facility IDs, and validate optional facility IDs.

## Symbols

### `isPatientAssociatedWithFacility`
#### Description
Checks if a patient is associated with a given facility.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient to check |
| facilityId | string | The ID of the facility to check against |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | boolean | True if the patient is associated with the facility, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `some` method to check if the `facilityId` exists in the patient's `facilityIds` array.

### `getFacilityIdOrFail`
#### Description
Retrieves a facility ID for a given patient, considering an optionally passed facility ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient to get the facility ID for |
| facilityId | string | Optional facility ID to check |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| facilityId | string | The facility ID associated with the patient |

#### Internal Logic
1. If a `facilityId` is provided, it checks if the patient is associated with it.
2. If no `facilityId` is provided, it checks if the patient is associated with only one facility.
3. If the patient is associated with multiple facilities and no `facilityId` is provided, it throws an error.
4. If the patient has no associated facilities, it throws an error.

### `validateOptionalFacilityId`
#### Description
Validates that a facility ID is associated with a patient or that the patient only has one facility if none is provided.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient to validate |
| facilityId | string | Optional facility ID to validate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | true | Always returns true if validation passes |

#### Internal Logic
This function calls `getFacilityIdOrFail` and returns true if no error is thrown.

## Error Handling
The code uses custom error classes:
- `BadRequestError`: Thrown when there's an issue with the patient-facility association.
- `MetriportError`: Thrown when there's a programming error (e.g., patient doesn't have a facility).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | Importing MetriportError class |
| ../../errors/bad-request | Importing BadRequestError class |
| @metriport/core/domain/patient | Importing Patient type |

The code relies on the Patient type having a `facilityIds` property, which is an array of facility IDs associated with the patient.
