## High-level description
This code defines the data structure and interfaces for a Coverage Enhancement feature in a medical domain. It outlines the shape of data for creating, updating, and representing a Coverage Enhancement entity, which includes information about connected query organization IDs and document counts.

## Code Structure
The code defines three main interfaces: `CoverageEnhancementCreate`, `CoverageEnhancementUpdate`, and `CoverageEnhancement`. These interfaces build upon each other and a base domain type to create a comprehensive representation of a Coverage Enhancement entity.

## Symbols

### `CoverageEnhancementData`
#### Description
Defines the structure of the data specific to a Coverage Enhancement.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cqOrgIds | string[] | An array of connected query organization IDs |
| docsFound | number (optional) | The number of documents found |

### `CoverageEnhancementCreate`
#### Description
Defines the structure for creating a new Coverage Enhancement entity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ecId | string | The ID of the enhancement coverage |
| cxId | string | The ID of the context |
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient |
| data | CoverageEnhancementData | The specific data for the coverage enhancement |

### `CoverageEnhancementUpdate`
#### Description
Defines the structure for updating an existing Coverage Enhancement entity. It is currently identical to `CoverageEnhancementCreate`.

### `CoverageEnhancement`
#### Description
Represents a complete Coverage Enhancement entity, combining the base domain properties with the create properties.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/base-domain | Provides the base domain types used in defining the Coverage Enhancement interfaces |

## References
This code is referenced and used in the following related files:
1. `packages/api/src/external/commonwell/cq-bridge/coverage-enhancement-storage.ts`: Uses the `CoverageEnhancementUpdate` interface for creating or updating coverage enhancements.
2. `packages/api/src/models/medical/coverage-enhancement.ts`: Implements the `CoverageEnhancement` interface in the `CoverageEnhancementModel` class for database operations.

## Notes
1. The code uses TypeScript's type system to ensure type safety and provide clear structure for the Coverage Enhancement feature.
2. The `CoverageEnhancementUpdate` interface is currently identical to `CoverageEnhancementCreate`, which might indicate that all fields are updateable or that the update structure hasn't been differentiated yet.
3. The `Base` type is defined as an omission of the `id` field from `BaseDomainCreate`, suggesting that the `id` is not required or is handled differently for Coverage Enhancement entities.
