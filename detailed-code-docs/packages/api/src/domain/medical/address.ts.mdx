## High-level description
This code defines a function `getAddressWithCoordinates` that takes an address and a customer ID, geocodes the address to add coordinates, and returns the address with coordinates. It's designed to enhance address data with geographic coordinates for use in medical-related applications.

## Symbols

### `getAddressWithCoordinates`
#### Description
This function takes an input address and a customer ID, adds geographic coordinates to the address, and returns the enhanced address. It uses the `addCoordinatesToAddresses` function to perform the geocoding.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| inputAddress | AddressStrict | The input address without coordinates |
| cxId | string | The customer ID |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| AddressWithCoordinates | object | The input address enhanced with coordinates |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `addCoordinatesToAddresses` with the input address and customer ID.
2. Extracts the first (and only) address from the result.
3. Checks if the address was successfully geocoded and has coordinates.
4. Throws an error if geocoding failed or coordinates are missing.
5. Returns the address with coordinates, ensuring the country is set (defaulting to "USA" if not provided).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/location-address | Provides types for address data |
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | Provides custom error type |
| ../../command/medical/patient/add-coordinates | Provides function to add coordinates to addresses |

## Error Handling
The function throws errors in two cases:
1. If geocoding fails (no address returned from `addCoordinatesToAddresses`).
2. If the geocoded address doesn't have coordinates.

## Performance Considerations
The function makes an asynchronous call to `addCoordinatesToAddresses`, which likely involves an external API call for geocoding. This could be a potential performance bottleneck, especially if called frequently or with large batches of addresses.

## References
- The `addCoordinatesToAddresses` function from `../../command/medical/patient/add-coordinates` is crucial for understanding the geocoding process.
- The `AddressStrict` and `AddressWithCoordinates` types from `@metriport/core/domain/location-address` define the structure of the input and output addresses.

This function plays a key role in enhancing address data with geographic coordinates, which is likely used in various parts of the medical-related application for location-based services or analysis.
