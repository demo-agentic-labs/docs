## High-level description
This directory contains test utility functions for creating mock objects related to various domain entities in the Metriport API. These utilities are designed to facilitate testing by providing easy ways to generate realistic test data for different parts of the system.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a set of functions that create mock objects for different domain entities used in the Metriport API. These functions generate test data with realistic properties, allowing developers to easily set up test scenarios without manually creating complex objects. The mock objects include base domain properties, connected users, settings, user tokens, and webhooks.

## Key Files

1. `base-domain.ts`:
   - Defines `makeBaseDomain` function to create mock `BaseDomain` objects.
   - Generates common properties like ID, creation timestamp, update timestamp, and eTag.

2. `make-connected-user.ts`:
   - Provides `makeConnectedUser` function to create partial `ConnectedUser` objects.
   - Allows flexible creation of user objects with default values for missing properties.

3. `settings.ts`:
   - Contains `makeSetting` function to generate mock `Settings` objects.
   - Combines base domain properties with settings-specific fields like webhook URL and status.

4. `user-token.ts`:
   - Defines `makeUserToken` function for creating mock `UserToken` objects.
   - Generates token-related fields and includes a `clone` method for easy duplication.

5. `webhook.ts`:
   - Implements `makeWebhook` function to create mock `WebhookRequest` objects.
   - Combines base domain properties with webhook-specific fields like type and status.

These utilities work together to provide a comprehensive set of tools for creating test data across different parts of the Metriport API domain model.

## Dependencies
The test utilities rely on the following external libraries:

1. @faker-js/faker (version not specified):
   - Used for generating random data such as UUIDs, URLs, and dates.
   - Chosen for its ability to create realistic mock data easily.

2. uuid (version not specified):
   - Used in some utilities for generating UUIDs.
   - Provides a standard way to create unique identifiers.

3. nanoid (version not specified):
   - Used in the `makeUserToken` function for generating unique tokens.
   - Chosen for its ability to create short, unique string IDs.

These dependencies are primarily used to generate random or unique values for various properties in the mock objects, enhancing the realism and uniqueness of the test data.

## Configuration
The test utilities in this directory do not rely on external configuration files or environment variables. Instead, they use hardcoded default values and random data generation to create mock objects. This approach allows for consistent and reproducible test data generation across different environments.

In cases where specific values are needed for testing, the functions generally accept parameters to override default values. For example, the `makeWebhook` function allows specifying the webhook type and status, while `makeUserToken` accepts a partial `UserToken` object to override any default values.

This flexibility in configuration allows developers to create both standardized and customized test data as needed for different testing scenarios.
