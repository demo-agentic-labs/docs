### `OAuth1Data`
#### Description
`OAuth1Data` is a TypeScript type definition that specifies the structure for OAuth 1.0 authentication data. It includes fields for different types of tokens used in the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the shape of an object that would be used in OAuth 1.0 authentication processes.

#### Outputs
This type definition doesn't produce outputs directly, but it defines the structure of objects that will be used elsewhere in the application.

#### Internal Logic
The type includes the following fields:
1. `userToken`: A string representing the token generated by Metriport for the Connect Widget.
2. `oauth_token`: A string representing the OAuth 1.0 request token.
3. `oauth_token_secret`: An optional string representing the OAuth 1.0 request token secret.
4. `userAccessToken`: An optional string representing the OAuth 1.0 access token.
5. `userAccessTokenSecret`: An optional string representing the OAuth 1.0 access token secret.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file suggests a potential future refactoring:
"Move to the same pattern as UserToken"

This indicates that there might be plans to restructure this type definition to align with a pattern used in a `UserToken` type or module elsewhere in the codebase.

## References
The comment mentions a "table 'token'", suggesting that the `userToken` field is likely related to a database table named "token". This implies that this type definition is probably used in conjunction with database operations involving OAuth tokens.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly import or use any external dependencies. It's a standalone type definition.
