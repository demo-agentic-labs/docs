## High-level description
This code defines the structure and constraints for the Settings domain in an API. It includes interfaces for creating and representing Settings objects, which primarily deal with webhook configurations. The file also defines maximum length constraints for webhook-related fields.

## Code Structure
The code defines two interfaces: `SettingsCreate` and `Settings`. `SettingsCreate` extends the `BaseDomainCreate` interface (omitting the 'id' field), while `Settings` combines `BaseDomain` and `SettingsCreate`.

## References
This code references `BaseDomain` and `BaseDomainCreate` from "@metriport/core/domain/base-domain".

## Symbols

### `maxWebhookUrlLength`
#### Description
A constant that defines the maximum allowed length for a webhook URL.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| maxWebhookUrlLength | number | The maximum length (2048) for a webhook URL |

### `maxWebhookStatusLength`
#### Description
A constant that defines the maximum allowed length for a webhook status.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| maxWebhookStatusLength | number | The maximum length (2048) for a webhook status |

### `SettingsCreate`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure for creating Settings objects. It extends `BaseDomainCreate` (omitting the 'id' field) and includes webhook-related properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhookUrl | string | The URL for the webhook |
| webhookKey | string | The key for the webhook |
| webhookEnabled | boolean | Indicates if the webhook is enabled |
| webhookStatusDetail | string | Detailed status of the webhook |

### `Settings`
#### Description
An interface that represents a complete Settings object. It combines `BaseDomain` and `SettingsCreate`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the Settings object |
| createdAt | Date | Timestamp of when the Settings object was created |
| updatedAt | Date | Timestamp of when the Settings object was last updated |
| eTag | string | Entity tag for the Settings object |
| webhookUrl | string | The URL for the webhook |
| webhookKey | string | The key for the webhook |
| webhookEnabled | boolean | Indicates if the webhook is enabled |
| webhookStatusDetail | string | Detailed status of the webhook |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/base-domain | Provides base interfaces for domain objects |

This code serves as a foundation for managing Settings objects in the API, particularly focusing on webhook configurations. It ensures that webhook URLs and statuses don't exceed specified length limits and provides a clear structure for creating and representing Settings objects.
