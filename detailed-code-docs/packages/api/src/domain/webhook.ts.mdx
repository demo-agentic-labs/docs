## High-level description
This code defines the domain model for webhook-related entities in a medical API. It includes types and interfaces for webhook requests, their statuses, and various webhook types for different medical data operations. The file also contains utility constants and types for handling both medical and device-related webhooks.

## Code Structure
The code defines several interconnected types and constants:
- `WebhookType` encompasses both medical and device-related webhook types.
- `WebhookRequestCreate` and `WebhookRequest` interfaces define the structure for creating and representing webhook requests.
- Various constants and types are defined for different webhook types and their statuses.
