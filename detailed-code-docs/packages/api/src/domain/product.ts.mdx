## High-level description
This code defines an enumeration `Product` in the file `packages/api/src/domain/product.ts`. It represents different product types within the Metriport API, specifically "devices" and "medical". The "devices" product is marked with a TODO comment indicating it will be removed when DAPI (presumably Devices API) is fully discontinued.

## Symbols

### `Product`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the different product types supported by the Metriport API.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is an enum definition)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is an enum definition)

#### Internal Logic
The enum defines two product types:
1. `devices`: Represents the devices product. It has a TODO comment indicating it will be removed when DAPI is fully discontinued.
2. `medical`: Represents the medical product.

## TODOs
- TODO 1411: Remove the `devices` enum value when DAPI (Devices API) is fully discontinued.

## References
The `Product` enum is referenced in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `webhook.ts`, it's used to determine the product type for webhook requests and analytics.
2. In `document-webhook.ts`, it's used when reporting usage for the medical product.
3. In `fitbit.ts`, it's indirectly used through the `reportDevicesUsage` function.
4. In `usage.ts`, it's used as a parameter for the `reportUsage` function to specify which product the usage is being reported for.

These references indicate that the `Product` enum plays a crucial role in distinguishing between different product types throughout the application, particularly in webhook processing, usage reporting, and analytics.

## Dependencies
This file has no external dependencies.

## Notes
The presence of the TODO comment suggests that there's an ongoing effort to discontinue the DAPI (Devices API), and the `devices` product type will be removed in the future. This change might have implications for other parts of the codebase that currently rely on the `devices` product type.
