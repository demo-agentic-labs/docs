## High-level description
This directory contains shared utilities and interfaces for handling authentication and analytics in the Metriport API. It includes implementations for OAuth1 and OAuth2 authentication flows, a no-authentication interface, HTTP client configuration, and analytics reporting.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides essential functionality for connecting external health data providers to the Metriport API. It handles various authentication methods, including OAuth1 and OAuth2, as well as cases where no authentication is required. The shared utilities enable:

1. Generating authorization URLs for users to grant access to their data.
2. Exchanging authorization codes for access tokens.
3. Refreshing and revoking access tokens.
4. Making authenticated HTTP requests to provider APIs.
5. Reporting analytics for API operations.

These shared components are designed to be used across different provider implementations, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication.

## Key Files

### analytics.ts
This file defines a function `executeAndReportAnalytics` that wraps the execution of API operations and potentially reports analytics about their execution. Currently, it's a placeholder for future implementation of analytics reporting.

### http.ts
Contains a utility function `getHttpClient` that creates and returns an instance of Axios with configurable timeout settings. This ensures consistent HTTP client configuration across the API.

### noauth.ts
Defines the `NoAuth` interface for providers that don't require traditional authentication. It includes a method for revoking provider access.

### oauth1.ts
Implements the OAuth1 authentication flow through the `OAuth1DefaultImpl` class. It handles token generation, user authorization, and token management for OAuth1 providers.

### oauth2.ts
Defines the `OAuth2` interface and provides a default implementation `OAuth2DefaultImpl` for handling OAuth2 authentication flows. It includes methods for authorization, token exchange, token refresh, and access revocation.

## Dependencies
- axios: Used for making HTTP requests to provider APIs.
- dayjs: Date manipulation library used in OAuth1 implementation.
- nanoid: Generates unique IDs for OAuth1 requests.
- oauth-signature: Used for generating OAuth1 signatures (deprecated due to security vulnerability).
- simple-oauth2: Handles OAuth2 operations in the default implementation.
- zod: Provides runtime type checking and validation for API responses.

## Configuration
The OAuth implementations (both OAuth1 and OAuth2) require configuration parameters such as client IDs, secrets, and endpoint URLs. These are typically provided when instantiating the respective classes.

Key configuration options include:
- `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`: Set to 20000 (20 seconds) for HTTP requests in `http.ts`.
- OAuth1 configuration: Includes `consumerKey`, `consumerSecret`, `userApproveUrl`, `requestTokenUrl`, and `requestAccessUrl`.
- OAuth2 configuration: Includes `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `tokenHost`, `authorizeHost`, `authorizePath`, `tokenPath`, and `revokePath`.

## Code Examples

1. Creating an HTTP client with custom timeout:

```typescript
const client = getHttpClient(30000); // 30 seconds timeout
```

2. Implementing a provider with no authentication:

```typescript
class SimpleProvider implements NoAuth {
  async revokeProviderAccess(connectedUser: ConnectedUser): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    // Implementation for revoking access
  }
}
```

3. Generating an OAuth2 authorization URL:

```typescript
const oauth2Client = new OAuth2DefaultImpl(
  "provider-name",
  clientId,
  clientSecret,
  oAuthConfig,
  scopes
);

const authUrl = await oauth2Client.getAuthUri("state-value");
```

4. Exchanging an authorization code for an access token (OAuth2):

```typescript
const accessToken = await oauth2Client.getTokenFromAuthCode(authorizationCode);
```

5. Refreshing an OAuth2 access token:

```typescript
const newToken = await oauth2Client.checkRefreshToken(oldToken, connectedUser);
```

These shared components provide a foundation for implementing various provider integrations in the Metriport API, ensuring consistent handling of authentication, HTTP requests, and analytics across different providers.
