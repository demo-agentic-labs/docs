## High-level description
This code defines a module for executing and reporting analytics for API operations. It's specifically designed for use with the DAPI (Device API) and provides a function to execute a given asynchronous operation while potentially reporting analytics about its execution.

## Symbols

### `ExtraType`
#### Description
A type definition that extends `Record&lt;string, string | undefined&gt;` and includes an `action` property of type `keyof Provider`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| action | keyof Provider | The action being performed, corresponding to a key of the Provider class |

#### Outputs
An object type with string keys and string or undefined values, plus the `action` property.

### `executeAndReportAnalytics&lt;R&gt;`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that executes a given function and potentially reports analytics about its execution. Currently, it simply executes the function and returns its result without any additional analytics reporting.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fnToExecute | () =&gt; Promise&lt;R&gt; | An asynchronous function to be executed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resp | R | The result of the executed function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the provided function `fnToExecute`.
2. Returns the result of the execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Provider | Imported from "../provider", likely used in the `ExtraType` definition |

## TODOs
The comment "DAPI only!" suggests that this function is intended to be used exclusively with the Device API. However, the current implementation doesn't include any DAPI-specific logic or analytics reporting. This might indicate that additional functionality is planned for future implementation.
