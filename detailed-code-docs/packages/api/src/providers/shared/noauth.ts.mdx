## High-level description
This code defines an interface `NoAuth` that represents a provider with no authentication mechanism. It includes a method for revoking provider access for a connected user. This interface is likely used as a common contract for providers that don't require traditional authentication methods.

## Symbols

### `NoAuth`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure for providers that don't require traditional authentication. It includes a method for revoking provider access.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is an interface definition)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is an interface definition)

### `revokeProviderAccess`
#### Description
A method defined in the `NoAuth` interface that revokes a provider's access for a connected user.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connectedUser | ConnectedUser | The user for whom the provider access is being revoked |
| rawParams | RawParams (optional) | Additional parameters that might be needed for the revocation process |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the revocation is complete |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly use any external libraries, but it imports types from other parts of the project.

## Notes
1. The `NoAuth` interface is likely implemented by provider classes that don't require traditional authentication methods. For example, in the related code snippets, we can see that both `Apple` and `Tenovi` classes implement this interface.

2. The `revokeProviderAccess` method is asynchronous, indicating that the process of revoking access might involve network requests or other time-consuming operations.

3. The `rawParams` parameter is optional, suggesting that some providers might need additional information to revoke access, while others might not.

4. This interface allows for a consistent way to handle access revocation across different providers, even if they don't use standard authentication methods.

5. The `ConnectedUser` type, imported from another file, likely represents a user who has connected their account with a provider. It probably contains information about the user's connection to various providers.

6. The `RawParams` type, also imported from another file, seems to be a structure for holding raw query parameters and headers from HTTP requests. This might be useful for providers that need specific HTTP headers or query parameters for their operations.
