## High-level description
This code provides functionality to geocode addresses using Amazon Location Services. It includes functions to build address text, geocode addresses, and manage AWS Location client instances. The main purpose is to convert address objects into geographic coordinates.

## Code Structure
The code defines several functions that work together to geocode addresses:
- `buildAddressText`: Formats an Address object into a string.
- `geocodeAddress`: Uses Amazon Location Services to geocode an address.
- Helper functions: `getIndexName`, `getPlaceIndexRegion`, and `getLocationClient` manage AWS Location client configuration.

## Symbols

### `buildAddressText`
#### Description
Constructs a formatted address string from an Address object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| address | Address | An object containing address details |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | Formatted address string |

### `geocodeAddress`
#### Description
Geocodes an address using Amazon Location Services.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| address | Address | An object containing address details |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | Promise&lt;GeocodingResult \| undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to geocoding results or undefined |

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds the address text using `buildAddressText`.
2. Sets up parameters for the AWS Location search request.
3. Calls the AWS Location service to search for the address.
4. Processes the response and returns the parsed suggested address if available.

### Helper Functions
- `getIndexName`: Retrieves and caches the place index name.
- `getPlaceIndexRegion`: Retrieves and caches the place index region.
- `getLocationClient`: Creates and caches an AWS Location client instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/address | Imports the Address type |
| @metriport/core/external/aws/location | Imports functions for working with AWS Location Services |
| aws-sdk | AWS SDK for interacting with AWS services |
| ../../shared/config | Imports configuration settings |

## Configuration
The code relies on configuration values from the `Config` class, specifically:
- `Config.getPlaceIndexName()`: Gets the name of the place index to use.
- `Config.getPlaceIndexRegion()`: Gets the region for the place index.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Errors from the AWS SDK calls will propagate to the caller.

## Performance Considerations
The code caches the AWS Location client and configuration values to avoid unnecessary instantiations and lookups.
