## High-level description
This code defines a function `ingestIntoSearchEngine` that ingests document reference data into a search engine (OpenSearch) for a given patient. It handles the ingestion process, including checking if the document is ingestible, performing the ingestion, and handling any errors that occur during the process.

### ingestIntoSearchEngine
#### Description
This function ingests document reference data into a search engine for a given patient. It checks if the document is ingestible, performs the ingestion, and handles any errors that occur during the process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Pick&lt;Patient, "id" \| "cxId"&gt; | Patient object containing id and cxId |
| fhirDoc | DocumentReferenceWithId | FHIR document reference |
| file | \{ key: string; bucket: string; contentType: string \| undefined \} | File information |
| requestId | string | Unique identifier for the request |
| log | function (optional) | Logging function, defaults to console.log |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the ingestion is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Create an OpenSearch ingest service instance.
2. Check if the document is ingestible based on its content type and file name.
3. If not ingestible, log a message and return.
4. If ingestible, attempt to ingest the document into OpenSearch.
5. If an error occurs during ingestion, log the error and capture it for monitoring, but do not throw an exception.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/util/error/shared | For error handling utilities |
| @metriport/core/util/notifications | For capturing error messages |
| @metriport/core/domain/patient | For Patient type definition |
| ../fhir/document | For DocumentReferenceWithId type definition |
| ../opensearch/file-search-connector-factory | For creating the OpenSearch ingest service |

## Error Handling
The function catches any errors that occur during the ingestion process. It logs the error message and captures it using the `capture.message` function for monitoring purposes. However, it intentionally does not throw an exception to prevent failures in the overall process due to search ingestion errors.

## Logging
The function uses the provided `log` function (or `console.log` by default) to log messages about skipping ingestion for non-ingestible documents and any errors that occur during the ingestion process.
