## High-level description
This code provides functionality for interacting with Amazon S3 services, specifically for creating S3 clients and generating signed URLs for S3 objects. It utilizes the AWS SDK and configuration settings from the application's environment.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `makeS3Client()` and `getSignedUrl()`. The `makeS3Client()` function creates an S3 client using configuration from the `Config` class, while `getSignedUrl()` generates a signed URL for accessing S3 objects.

## References
- `@metriport/core/external/aws/s3`: Used for the core S3 client creation functionality.
- `../../shared/config`: Used for accessing AWS configuration settings.

## Symbols

### `makeS3Client()`
#### Description
Creates and returns an S3 client using the AWS region specified in the application's configuration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| S3Client | object | An instance of the S3 client |

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `coreMakeS3Client` function from the core library, passing the AWS region obtained from the `Config` class.

### `getSignedUrl()`
#### Description
Generates a signed URL for accessing an S3 object, with optional custom expiration duration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bucketName | string | The name of the S3 bucket |
| fileName | string | The key (file name) of the S3 object |
| durationSeconds | number (optional) | The duration in seconds for which the signed URL is valid |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| signedUrl | Promise&lt;string&gt; | A promise that resolves to the generated signed URL |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an S3 client using `makeS3Client()`.
2. Calls the `getSignedUrl` method on the S3 client with the following parameters:
   - Operation: "getObject"
   - Bucket: The provided bucket name
   - Key: The provided file name
   - Expires: The provided duration or the default duration (3 minutes)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/external/aws/s3 | Provides core S3 client creation functionality |
| dayjs | Used for handling durations and time calculations |

## Configuration
The code relies on the following configuration option:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DEFAULT_SIGNED_URL_DURATION | number | 180 (3 minutes) | The default duration for signed URLs in seconds |

## Performance Considerations
The `getSignedUrl` function is asynchronous, which allows for non-blocking execution when generating signed URLs. This is important for maintaining application responsiveness, especially when dealing with potentially slow network operations.
