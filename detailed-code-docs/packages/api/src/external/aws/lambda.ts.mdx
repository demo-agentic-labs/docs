## High-level description
This code defines a function `makeLambdaClient()` that creates and returns an AWS Lambda client. It's designed to be used for interacting with AWS Lambda services, but it's marked as deprecated in favor of using `@metriport/core` instead.

## Symbols

### `makeLambdaClient()`
#### Description
This function creates and returns a new instance of the AWS Lambda client. It configures the client with a specific signature version and region.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lambdaClient | AWS.Lambda | An instance of the AWS Lambda client |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `AWS.Lambda` instance with the following configuration:
   - `signatureVersion` set to "v4"
   - `region` set to the value returned by `Config.getAWSRegion()`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-sdk | Provides the AWS.Lambda class for interacting with AWS Lambda services |
| ../../shared/config | Imports the Config class for accessing configuration settings |

## References
- `Config.getAWSRegion()`: This method is called to get the AWS region for configuring the Lambda client.

## Side Effects
This function doesn't have any side effects. It simply creates and returns a new AWS Lambda client instance.

## Performance Considerations
Creating a new AWS Lambda client for each function call might not be the most efficient approach if this function is called frequently. Consider implementing a caching mechanism or creating a singleton instance if performance becomes an issue.

## TODOs
The function is marked as deprecated with the comment:
```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated Use @metriport/core instead
 */
```
This suggests that there's a plan to replace this function with an equivalent one from the `@metriport/core` package. Users of this function should be aware of this deprecation and plan to migrate to the new implementation when it becomes available.
