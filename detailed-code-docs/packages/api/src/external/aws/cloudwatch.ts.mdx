Here's the documentation for the provided code:

## High-level description
This code defines a module for interacting with Amazon CloudWatch, specifically for reporting custom metrics. It provides functionality to send metric data to CloudWatch, which can be used for monitoring and alerting purposes.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are `METRICS_NAMESPACE`, `Metric`, and `reportMetric`. The `reportMetric` function uses the `METRICS_NAMESPACE` constant and the `Metric` type to send metric data to CloudWatch.

## Symbols

### `METRICS_NAMESPACE`
#### Description
A constant string representing the namespace for Metriport metrics in CloudWatch.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| METRICS_NAMESPACE | string | The namespace for Metriport metrics |

### `Metric`
#### Description
A type definition for a metric to be reported to CloudWatch.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the metric |
| unit | "Milliseconds" | The unit of measurement for the metric |
| value | number \| string | The value of the metric |
| timestamp | Date (optional) | The timestamp for the metric data point |
| additionalDimension | string (optional) | An additional dimension for the metric |

### `reportMetric`
#### Description
A function that reports a metric to CloudWatch.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metric | Metric | The metric to be reported |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a base metric object with the provided data.
2. Constructs the CloudWatch `putMetricData` parameters, including two data points:
   - One with an additional dimension if provided.
   - One with a fixed "Service" dimension set to "OSS API".
3. Calls the CloudWatch `putMetricData` method to send the metric data.
4. Handles any errors that occur during the process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-sdk | To interact with AWS CloudWatch |
| ../../shared/config | To get AWS region configuration |
| ../../shared/notifications | For error capturing and reporting |

## Error Handling
The function catches any errors that occur during the metric reporting process. It logs the error to the console and captures it using the `capture.error` method from the notifications module.

## Logging
The code uses `console.error` to log any errors that occur during the metric reporting process.

## TODOs
- Move this functionality to @metriport/core as indicated by the @deprecated comments.
