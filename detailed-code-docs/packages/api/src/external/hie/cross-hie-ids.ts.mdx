This code is part of a larger system that deals with patient data and interoperability between different health information exchanges (HIEs). The `getCqOrgIdsToDenyOnCw` function specifically helps in identifying organizations that should not be included in CommonWell operations, which is likely used in other parts of the system to filter or exclude certain organizations when interacting with CommonWell.
