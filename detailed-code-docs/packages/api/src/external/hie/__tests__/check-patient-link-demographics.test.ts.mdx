## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `checkLinkDemographicsAcrossHies` function, which checks for patient link demographics across different Health Information Exchanges (HIEs). The tests cover various scenarios involving CommonWell (CW) and Carequality (CQ) patient data.

## Code Structure
The test file sets up mock functions for database operations and defines several test cases to verify the behavior of `checkLinkDemographicsAcrossHies` under different conditions.

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test case by mocking the database transaction and creating spy instances for database operations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `startTransaction` function.
2. Creates spy instances for `findOne` methods of `PatientModel`, `CQPatientDataModel`, and `CwPatientDataModel`.

### `afterEach`
#### Description
Cleans up the test environment after each test case.

#### Internal Logic
Clears all mocks to ensure a clean slate for the next test.

### `describe("check for patient link demographics", ...)`
#### Description
Groups together test cases for checking patient link demographics across HIEs.

### Test Cases
The file contains five test cases, each testing a different scenario:

1. CW has data, CQ doesn't
2. CW doesn't have data, CQ does
3. CW has data, CQ doesn't (duplicate of case 1)
4. Neither CW nor CQ has data (new patient)
5. Neither CW nor CQ has matching request ID

#### Internal Logic for each test case
1. Arrange: Set up mock data for patient, CW, and CQ models.
2. Act: Call `checkLinkDemographicsAcrossHies` with the arranged data.
3. Assert: Check if the function returns the expected result (true or false).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| jest | Testing framework used for mocking and assertions |
| PatientModel | Model for patient data |
| CQPatientDataModel | Model for Carequality patient data |
| CwPatientDataModel | Model for CommonWell patient data |
| checkLinkDemographicsAcrossHies | Function being tested |

## Notes
- The test file uses helper functions like `makePatient`, `makeCqPatientData`, and `makeCwPatientData` to create test data.
- The `coreDemographics` constant is used as sample demographic data.
- There's a duplicate test case (CW has data, CQ doesn't) which could be removed or modified for better test coverage.
- The tests focus on checking if the function correctly identifies the presence of link demographics based on the request ID and the data available in CW and CQ models.
