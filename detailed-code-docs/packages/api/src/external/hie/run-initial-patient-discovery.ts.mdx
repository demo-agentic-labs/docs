## High-level description
This code defines a function `runInitialPatientDiscoveryAcrossHies` that performs initial patient discovery across multiple Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), specifically Carequality and CommonWell. It handles the process of discovering patient information and creating patient records in these HIEs asynchronously.

## Code Structure
The main function `runInitialPatientDiscoveryAcrossHies` calls two separate functions: `discover` for Carequality and `create` for CommonWell. These functions are executed asynchronously and any errors are caught and processed using `processAsyncError`.

## Symbols

### `runInitialPatientDiscoveryAcrossHies`
#### Description
This function initiates the patient discovery process across multiple HIEs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient object to be discovered |
| facilityId | string | The ID of the facility |
| rerunPdOnNewDemographics | boolean | Optional flag to rerun patient discovery on new demographics |
| forceCommonwell | boolean | Optional flag to force CommonWell discovery |
| forceCarequality | boolean | Optional flag to force Carequality discovery |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the existing patient using `getPatientOrFail`.
2. Generates a new request ID using `uuidv7`.
3. Calls `discover` function for Carequality asynchronously.
4. Calls `create` function for CommonWell asynchronously.
5. Both calls are wrapped in `catch` blocks that use `processAsyncError` to handle any errors.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/patient | Imports the Patient type |
| @metriport/core/util/uuid-v7 | Provides the uuidv7 function for generating unique IDs |
| @metriport/core/util/error/shared | Provides the processAsyncError function for error handling |

## Error Handling
The function uses `processAsyncError` to handle errors that may occur during the Carequality discovery or CommonWell creation processes. This allows for asynchronous error processing without blocking the main execution.

## Notes
- The function runs patient discovery for both Carequality and CommonWell in parallel, using asynchronous calls.
- The `rerunPdOnNewDemographics`, `forceCommonwell`, and `forceCarequality` flags provide flexibility in controlling the discovery process.
- The actual implementation of `discover` and `create` functions is not provided in this file, but they are likely defined in the imported modules.
