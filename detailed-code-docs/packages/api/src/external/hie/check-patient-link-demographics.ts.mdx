## High-level description
This code defines a function `checkLinkDemographicsAcrossHies` that checks for new patient demographic links across two Health Information Exchanges (HIEs): Carequality and CommonWell. It retrieves patient data from both HIEs and checks if new demographic information is available for a given request ID.

## Symbols

### `checkLinkDemographicsAcrossHies`
#### Description
This asynchronous function checks if new patient demographic links are available in either Carequality or CommonWell HIEs for a given patient and request ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Pick&lt;Patient, "id" \| "cxId"&gt; | An object containing the patient's ID and customer ID |
| requestId | string | A unique identifier for the current request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;boolean&gt; | A boolean indicating whether new demographic links were found |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function concurrently retrieves patient data from Carequality and CommonWell using `Promise.all`.
2. It then checks if the `requestId` exists in the `linkDemographicsHistory` of either HIE's data.
3. Returns `true` if new demographics are found in either HIE, `false` otherwise.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/patient | Imports the Patient type |
| ../../external/carequality/command/cq-patient-data/get-cq-data | Imports the function to get Carequality patient data |
| ../../external/commonwell/command/cw-patient-data/get-cw-data | Imports the function to get CommonWell patient data |

## References
The function references two external functions:
- `getCQPatientData`: Retrieves patient data from Carequality
- `getCwPatientData`: Retrieves patient data from CommonWell

These functions are likely defined in their respective files as indicated by the import statements.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses `Promise.all` to concurrently fetch data from both HIEs, which can improve performance by reducing the overall execution time compared to sequential requests.
