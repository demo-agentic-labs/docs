## High-level description
The `getOrganizationsForXCPD` function retrieves and aggregates organization data from different Carequality (CQ) gateways, sorts them based on a provided order map, and returns the combined list. This function is likely used to populate a directory of healthcare organizations for XCPD (Cross-Community Patient Discovery) functionality.

## Code Structure
The `getOrganizationsForXCPD` function orchestrates the retrieval and sorting of organization data. It calls three helper functions (`getRecordLocatorServiceOrganizations`, `getSublinkOrganizations`, `getStandaloneOrganizations`) to fetch data from different CQ gateways. It then uses the `sortOrgsByNearbyOrder` function to sort the results from two of the gateways based on a provided order map. Finally, it combines and returns the sorted organization lists.

## References
- `CQDirectoryEntryModel`: Represents an entry in the CQ directory, containing organization details.
- `getRecordLocatorServiceOrganizations`: Retrieves organizations from the Record Locator Service gateway.
- `getSublinkOrganizations`: Retrieves organizations from the Sublink gateway.
- `getStandaloneOrganizations`: Retrieves standalone organizations.

## Symbols

### `getOrganizationsForXCPD`
#### Description
Retrieves, aggregates, and sorts organization data from different CQ gateways for XCPD functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nearbyOrgOrderMap | `Map&lt;string, number&gt;` | A map specifying the desired order of organizations based on their IDs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;CQDirectoryEntryModel[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `CQDirectoryEntryModel` objects representing the aggregated and sorted organization data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches organization data concurrently from three CQ gateways: Record Locator Service, Sublink, and Standalone.
2. Sorts the Sublink and Standalone organization lists using the provided `nearbyOrgOrderMap`.
3. Concatenates the organization lists from all three gateways, placing the Record Locator Service results first, followed by the sorted Sublink and Standalone results.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/carequality-sdk`: Provides models and potentially other utilities for interacting with Carequality.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Any errors during data fetching or sorting will likely propagate up the call stack.
