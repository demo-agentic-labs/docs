## High-level description
The `rebuildCQDirectory` function rebuilds the Carequality (CQ) directory in the Metriport system. It fetches organization data from the CQ directory in batches, parses and inserts them into a temporary table, and finally renames tables to update the directory with the new data.

## Code Structure
The code defines a main function `rebuildCQDirectory` and several helper functions. The `rebuildCQDirectory` function orchestrates the process of rebuilding the CQ directory by calling the helper functions in a specific order. The helper functions handle tasks such as creating and deleting temporary tables, inserting data, and renaming tables.

## References
- `makeCarequalityManagementAPI`: This function is used to create an instance of the Carequality Management API client.
- `parseCQDirectoryEntries`: This function is used to parse the organization data retrieved from the CQ directory.
- `bulkInsertCQDirectoryEntries`: This function is used to insert the parsed organization data into the database.
- `cqDirectoryEntry`, `cqDirectoryEntryBackup`, `cqDirectoryEntryTemp`: These constants represent the names of the tables used to store the CQ directory data.

## Symbols
### `rebuildCQDirectory`
#### Description
This function rebuilds the Carequality directory by fetching organization data from the CQ directory, parsing it, and storing it in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| failGracefully | boolean | Optional, determines if the function should throw an error or not if it encounters an error during the rebuild process. Defaults to false. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
    - Initializes a logger and sets the starting position for fetching organizations from the CQ directory.
    - Creates an instance of the Carequality Management API client.
2. **Create Temporary Table:**
    - Creates a temporary table to store the new CQ directory data.
3. **Fetch and Insert Data:**
    - Enters a loop that continues until all organizations have been fetched from the CQ directory.
    - Fetches a batch of organizations from the CQ directory using the `listOrganizations` method of the Carequality Management API client.
    - Parses the fetched organization data using the `parseCQDirectoryEntries` function.
    - Inserts the parsed organization data into the temporary table using the `bulkInsertCQDirectoryEntries` function.
    - Sleeps for a short duration to avoid rate limiting by the CQ directory.
4. **Rename Tables and Update Indexes:**
    - Renames the existing CQ directory table to a backup table.
    - Renames the temporary table to the CQ directory table.
    - Adds an updated_at trigger to the CQ directory table.
5. **Error Handling:**
    - If any error occurs during the process, the function logs the error and captures it using the `capture` function.
    - If `failGracefully` is set to `false`, the function throws the error.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the database by creating, updating, and deleting tables.
- Sends notifications in case of errors.

#### Performance Considerations
- The function fetches organization data in batches to improve performance and avoid overwhelming the CQ directory.
- The function uses a temporary table to store the new CQ directory data, which allows for faster data insertion and reduces the downtime of the CQ directory table.
- The function sleeps for a short duration after each batch of organizations is fetched to avoid rate limiting by the CQ directory.

## Error Handling
- The function uses a `try-catch` block to handle errors during the rebuild process.
- If an error occurs, the function logs the error and captures it using the `capture` function.
- If `failGracefully` is set to `false`, the function throws the error.

## Logging
- The function uses the `out` function from the `@metriport/core/util/log` package to log messages during the rebuild process.

## TODOs
None.
