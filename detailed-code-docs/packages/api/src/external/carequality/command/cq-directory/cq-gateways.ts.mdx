## High-level description
The code defines several utility functions for querying the `CQDirectoryEntryModel`, which represents entries in the Carequality directory. These functions primarily focus on filtering and retrieving organizations based on their management status and URL properties related to data exchange services.

## Code Structure
The code consists of five exported asynchronous functions: `getOrganizationIdsNotManagedBy`, `getRecordLocatorServiceOrganizations`, `getSublinkOrganizations`, and `getStandaloneOrganizations`. Each function performs a specific type of query on the `CQDirectoryEntryModel` using Sequelize operators and conditions. 

## References
- `CQDirectoryEntryModel`: Represents the Sequelize model for Carequality directory entries.

### `getOrganizationIdsNotManagedBy`
#### Description
This function retrieves the IDs of CQ directory entries that are not managed by the organizations specified in the input array.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| managingOrgNames | `string[]` | An array of organization names to exclude from the results. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;string[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of CQ directory entry IDs. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `CQDirectoryEntryModel` to find entries where:
    - `managingOrganization` is undefined, or
    - `managingOrganization` is not included in the provided `managingOrgNames` array.
2. Extracts the `id` property from each retrieved entry.
3. Returns the array of extracted IDs.

### `getRecordLocatorServiceOrganizations`
#### Description
This function retrieves CQ directory entries that have a non-empty `urlXCPD` field and are either self-managed or managed by an organization with an ID matching their own. It also includes entries with a non-empty `urlXCPD` field and a managing organization starting with "eHealth".

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;CQDirectoryEntryModel[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `CQDirectoryEntryModel` instances. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes two separate queries on the `CQDirectoryEntryModel`:
    - The first query selects entries where `urlXCPD` is not empty and either `managingOrganizationId` is undefined or equal to the entry's own ID.
    - The second query selects entries where `urlXCPD` is not empty and `managingOrganization` starts with "eHealth%".
2. Combines the results of both queries into a single array.
3. Returns the combined array of `CQDirectoryEntryModel` instances.

### `getSublinkOrganizations`
#### Description
This function retrieves CQ directory entries that have a non-empty `urlXCPD` field, a `managingOrganization` not equal to "commonwell" (case-insensitive), and a `managingOrganizationId` that is either undefined or belongs to an organization with a null `urlXCPD` and a matching `managingOrganizationId` or `name`. The results are ordered by a calculated value based on whether `managingOrganization` is "epic" (case-insensitive) and then by `managingOrganization`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;CQDirectoryEntryModel[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `CQDirectoryEntryModel` instances. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `CQDirectoryEntryModel` to find entries where:
    - `urlXCPD` is not empty.
    - `managingOrganization` is not "commonwell" (case-insensitive).
    - `managingOrganizationId` is either undefined or included in a subquery that selects IDs from entries with a null `urlXCPD` and a matching `managingOrganizationId` or `name`.
2. Orders the results first by a calculated value that prioritizes entries with `managingOrganization` equal to "epic" (case-insensitive) and then by `managingOrganization`.
3. Returns the array of `CQDirectoryEntryModel` instances.

### `getStandaloneOrganizations`
#### Description
This function retrieves CQ directory entries that have a non-empty `urlXCPD` field and are not managed by any other organization, directly or indirectly.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;CQDirectoryEntryModel[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `CQDirectoryEntryModel` instances. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `CQDirectoryEntryModel` to find entries where:
    - `urlXCPD` is not empty.
    - The entry's ID is not included in two subqueries:
        - The first subquery selects IDs from entries with a non-empty `urlXCPD` and either a null `managingOrganizationId` or a `managingOrganizationId` matching the entry's own ID.
        - The second subquery selects IDs from entries with a non-empty `urlXCPD` and a `managingOrganizationId` that belongs to an organization with a null `urlXCPD` and a matching `managingOrganizationId` or `name`.
2. Returns the array of `CQDirectoryEntryModel` instances.
