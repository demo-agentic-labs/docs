## High-level description
The `createOutboundPatientDiscoveryResp` function in `create-outbound-patient-discovery-resp.ts` is responsible for persisting the response received from an external gateway after a Patient Discovery request. It takes the response details as input and creates a new record in the `OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel` table.

## References
- `OutboundPatientDiscoveryResp` from `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk`: Represents the response structure from the external gateway.
- `OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel` from `../../models/outbound-patient-discovery-resp`: Sequelize model for the `patient_discovery_result` table.
- `DefaultPayload` from `./shared`: Likely contains common payload properties like `id`, `requestId`, `patientId`.

## Symbols

### `createOutboundPatientDiscoveryResp`
#### Description
This function creates a new record in the database to store the response received from an external gateway for a Patient Discovery request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | `CreatePatientDiscoverRespParam` | An object containing the response details to be persisted. It includes the response status, the actual response object from the external gateway, and likely common payload properties like `id`, `requestId`, `patientId`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel&gt; | A promise that resolves to the newly created `OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel` instance representing the persisted response. |

#### Internal Logic
1.  The function receives the response details in the `payload` object.
2.  It uses the `OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel.create` method to create a new record in the `patient_discovery_result` table.
3.  The new record is populated with the following data from the `payload`:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the response.
    - `requestId`: Unique identifier for the original request.
    - `patientId`: Unique identifier for the patient.
    - `status`: Status of the response (e.g., "success", "failure").
    - `data`: The actual response object received from the external gateway.
4.  The function returns a promise that resolves to the newly created `OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel` instance.
