## High-level description
This directory contains modules for managing CareQuality (CQ) patient data within the API. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving CQ patient data, which includes patient links and demographics history. The code is designed to work with a database, likely using Sequelize as an ORM, and implements operations within database transactions to ensure data integrity.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory handles the following main operations:

1. Creating or updating CQ patient data: It allows for the creation of new CQ patient records or the update of existing ones. This includes managing patient links and their demographics history.

2. Retrieving CQ patient data: It provides functions to fetch CQ patient data based on patient ID and customer ID. There are options to retrieve the data with or without throwing an error if the data is not found.

3. Updating CQ patient data: It enables the update of existing CQ patient records, merging new data with existing data while ensuring uniqueness of patient links.

4. Deleting CQ patient data: It allows for the removal of CQ patient records from the database.

These operations are designed to work within database transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity throughout the process.

## Key Files

1. `create-cq-data.ts`:
   - Contains the `createOrUpdateCQPatientData` function for creating or updating CQ patient data.
   - Handles the persistence of patient links and demographics history.

2. `get-cq-data.ts`:
   - Defines `getCQPatientData` and `getCQPatientDataOrFail` functions for retrieving CQ patient data.
   - Provides options for database transactions and locking.

3. `update-cq-data.ts`:
   - Implements `updateCQPatientData` and `updateCQPatientDataWithinDBTx` functions for updating CQ patient data.
   - Manages merging of new data with existing data, ensuring uniqueness of patient links.

4. `delete-cq-data.ts`:
   - Contains the `deleteCQPatientData` function for removing CQ patient data from the database.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Sequelize: Used for database operations and transactions.
2. Lodash: Utilized for utility functions like `uniqBy` for deduplicating arrays.
3. Internal modules:
   - `@metriport/core/util/error/not-found`: Provides the `NotFoundError` class.
   - `@metriport/core/domain/patient-demographics`: Defines types like `LinkDemographics`.
   - Various internal models and command modules for database operations and type definitions.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the code likely relies on database configuration set up elsewhere in the project. The database schema should include a `cq_patient_data` table corresponding to the `CQPatientDataModel`.

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in several ways:

1. Use of database transactions to ensure atomicity of operations and allow for rollbacks in case of errors.
2. The `getCQPatientDataOrFail` function throws a `NotFoundError` if the requested data is not found.
3. Most functions are designed to propagate errors to the caller, allowing for centralized error handling at a higher level of the application.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of functions for managing CareQuality patient data, ensuring data integrity and consistency through the use of database transactions and careful merging of new and existing data.
