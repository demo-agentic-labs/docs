title: "get-non-existent-doc-refs.ts"
---

## High-level description
The `getNonExistentDocRefs` function identifies document references that are missing from an S3 bucket but are expected based on either a provided list or FHIR records. It returns a list of document references that need to be downloaded.

## Code Structure
The code defines two functions: `getNonExistentDocRefs` and `checkDocRefsExistInS3`. 
- `getNonExistentDocRefs` orchestrates the process by first calling `checkDocRefsExistInS3` to compare the provided document references against S3 and then comparing the results against FHIR records. 
- `checkDocRefsExistInS3` is responsible for checking the existence of each document reference in the S3 bucket.

## Symbols

### `getNonExistentDocRefs`
#### Description
This function identifies document references that are not present in the S3 bucket but are expected based on the provided list and FHIR records. It returns a list of document references that need to be downloaded.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| documents | `DocumentReferenceWithMetriportId[]` | An array of document references with associated Metriport IDs. |
| patientId | `string` | The ID of the patient. |
| cxId | `string` | The ID of the context (e.g., clinic). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `Promise&lt;DocumentReferenceWithMetriportId[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of document references that are not present in the S3 bucket but are expected. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check S3 and FHIR:** It concurrently checks for the existence of the document references in the S3 bucket (`checkDocRefsExistInS3`) and retrieves document references from FHIR (`getDocumentsFromFHIR`).
2. **Identify Discrepancies:** It compares the results from S3 and FHIR to identify:
    - Documents present in S3 but not in FHIR.
    - Documents missing from S3 but present in FHIR.
3. **Combine Results:** It combines the lists of missing documents from both checks.
4. **Return Missing Documents:** It returns the combined list of document references that need to be downloaded.

### `checkDocRefsExistInS3`
#### Description
This function checks the existence of each document reference in the S3 bucket and categorizes them as existing or non-existing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| documents | `DocumentReferenceWithMetriportId[]` | An array of document references with associated Metriport IDs. |
| patientId | `string` | The ID of the patient. |
| cxId | `string` | The ID of the context (e.g., clinic). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `Promise&lt;ObservedDocRefs&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an object containing two arrays: `existingDocRefs` (documents found in S3) and `nonExistingDocRefs` (documents not found in S3). |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Parallel S3 Checks:** It iterates through the provided document references and uses `executeAsynchronously` to perform parallel checks for each document's existence in the S3 bucket.
2. **Construct File Path:** For each document, it constructs the S3 file path using `createDocumentFilePath`.
3. **Check File Existence:** It uses `s3Utils.getFileInfoFromS3` to check if the file exists in the specified S3 bucket.
4. **Categorize Documents:** Based on the S3 check results, it categorizes the documents into `existingDocRefs` and `nonExistingDocRefs` arrays.
5. **Return Categorized Documents:** It returns the categorized document references.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/document/filename | Provides functions for constructing document file names and paths. |
| @metriport/core/external/aws/s3 | Provides utilities for interacting with AWS S3. |
| @metriport/core/util/concurrency | Provides functions for managing asynchronous operations. |
| @metriport/core/util/error/shared | Provides functions for handling and formatting errors. |
| @metriport/core/util/log | Provides logging utilities. |
| @metriport/core/util/notifications | Provides functions for sending notifications and alerts. |
| ../../../shared/config | Provides access to configuration settings. |
| ../../fhir/document/get-documents | Provides functions for retrieving document references from FHIR. |

## Configuration
The code relies on the following configuration settings from the `Config` class:
| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `AWS_REGION` | The AWS region where the S3 bucket is located. |
| `MEDICAL_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET_NAME` | The name of the S3 bucket containing medical documents. |

## Error Handling
The `checkDocRefsExistInS3` function includes error handling using a `try...catch` block. If an error occurs during the S3 check, it logs the error message and captures the error using the `capture` utility. The error is then re-thrown to be handled by the calling function.

## Logging
The code uses the `out` utility for logging. It logs messages at various stages of the process, including the start of the S3 check and any errors encountered.
