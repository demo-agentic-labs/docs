## High-level description
The `createOutboundDocumentQueryRequests` function is responsible for generating a list of `OutboundDocumentQueryReq` objects, which are used to query external gateways for patient documents. The function tailors the requests based on the specific requirements of each gateway, such as date range handling and document reference limits.

## Code Structure
The code defines a main function `createOutboundDocumentQueryRequests` that orchestrates the creation of document query requests. It utilizes helper functions `buildRequest`, `buildRequestsWithDateRanges`, and relies on external functions like `doesGatewayNeedDateRanges` and `getSystemUserName`.

## References
- `OutboundDocumentQueryReq`: This type is defined in the `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk` package and represents a document query request.
- `HieInitiator`: This type is defined in the `../../hie/get-hie-initiator` module and represents the initiator of a health information exchange (HIE) request.
- `CQLink`: This type is defined in the `../cq-patient-data` module and represents a link to an external Carequality gateway and patient.
- `doesGatewayNeedDateRanges`: This function is defined in the `@metriport/core/external/carequality/ihe-gateway-v2/gateways` module and determines if a gateway requires date ranges for document queries.
- `getSystemUserName`: This function is defined in the `../shared` module and retrieves the system username for a given organization.

### `createOutboundDocumentQueryRequests`
#### Description
This function generates a list of `OutboundDocumentQueryReq` objects for querying external gateways for patient documents. It iterates through a list of `CQLink` objects, each representing a gateway and associated patient data, and constructs requests tailored to the specific requirements of each gateway.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requestId | string | Unique identifier for the request. |
| patient | Patient | The patient for whom documents are being requested. |
| initiator | HieInitiator | Information about the initiator of the HIE request. |
| cxId | string | Unique identifier for the customer. |
| cqLinks | CQLink[] | List of links to external Carequality gateways and patient data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requests | OutboundDocumentQueryReq[] | A list of document query requests tailored for each external gateway. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current timestamp and system username.
2. Iterates through the provided `cqLinks`.
3. For each `CQLink`:
    - If the gateway requires date ranges (determined by `doesGatewayNeedDateRanges`), it calls `buildRequestsWithDateRanges` to generate multiple requests with different date ranges.
    - Otherwise, it calls `buildRequest` to generate a single request without date ranges.
4. Returns the combined list of generated requests.

### `buildRequest`
#### Description
This function constructs a single `OutboundDocumentQueryReq` object with optional date range information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requestId | string | Unique identifier for the request. |
| cxId | string | Unique identifier for the customer. |
| now | dayjs.Dayjs | Current timestamp. |
| user | string | System username. |
| initiator | HieInitiator | Information about the initiator of the HIE request. |
| externalGateway | CQLink | Link to the external Carequality gateway and patient data. |
| patient | Patient | The patient for whom documents are being requested. |
| dateFrom | string | Optional start date for the document query. |
| dateTo | string | Optional end date for the document query. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| request | OutboundDocumentQueryReq | A document query request object. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `OutboundDocumentQueryReq` object with basic information like request ID, timestamp, SAML attributes, gateway details, and patient ID.
2. If `dateFrom` and `dateTo` are provided, it adds a `documentCreationDate` field to the request with the specified date range.
3. Returns the constructed request object.

### `buildRequestsWithDateRanges`
#### Description
This function constructs multiple `OutboundDocumentQueryReq` objects, each with a different date range, for gateways that require date range-based queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requestId | string | Unique identifier for the request. |
| cxId | string | Unique identifier for the customer. |
| now | dayjs.Dayjs | Current timestamp. |
| user | string | System username. |
| initiator | HieInitiator | Information about the initiator of the HIE request. |
| externalGateway | CQLink | Link to the external Carequality gateway and patient data. |
| patient | Patient | The patient for whom documents are being requested. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requests | OutboundDocumentQueryReq[] | A list of document query requests, each with a different date range. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an empty array `requests`.
2. Iterates 10 times to create 10 requests with different date ranges.
3. For each iteration:
    - Calculates the `dateTo` as the current timestamp minus a multiple of 6 months.
    - Calculates the `dateFrom` as either the previous iteration's `dateTo` or 25 years before the current timestamp for the last iteration.
    - Calls `buildRequest` to create a request object with the calculated date range.
    - Pushes the created request object into the `requests` array.
4. Returns the `requests` array containing all the generated requests.
