## High-level description
This directory contains modules for handling Carequality document-related operations within the API package. It includes functionality for creating outbound document query and retrieval requests, processing responses, filtering and managing document references, and converting Carequality documents to FHIR format.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key functions related to Carequality document operations:

1. Creates outbound document query requests to retrieve patient documents from external gateways.
2. Processes the responses from these document queries, including downloading new documents and converting them to FHIR format.
3. Creates outbound document retrieval requests based on the query results.
4. Processes the responses from document retrieval requests, including storing documents in S3 and updating FHIR records.
5. Filters and manages document references, including handling duplicates and adding Metriport IDs.
6. Converts Carequality document references to FHIR format.
7. Manages the overall process of querying and retrieving documents from Carequality for a given patient.

## Entry points
The main entry point for Carequality document operations is the `getDocumentsFromCQ` function in the `query-documents.ts` file. This function orchestrates the entire process of retrieving documents from Carequality for a given patient, including:

1. Checking prerequisites and patient data.
2. Handling patient discovery if necessary.
3. Creating and sending document query requests.
4. Polling for results and processing responses.

The data flow typically follows this path:
1. `query-documents.ts` initiates the document retrieval process.
2. `create-outbound-document-query-req.ts` generates the query requests.
3. `process-outbound-document-query-resps.ts` handles the query responses.
4. `create-outbound-document-retrieval-req.ts` creates retrieval requests based on query results.
5. `process-outbound-document-retrieval-resps.ts` processes the retrieved documents.

Throughout this process, various utility functions from `shared.ts` and other files are used to handle document references, convert formats, and manage data.

## Key Files
1. `query-documents.ts`: Contains the main entry point `getDocumentsFromCQ` for initiating the document retrieval process.
2. `create-outbound-document-query-req.ts`: Generates outbound document query requests.
3. `process-outbound-document-query-resps.ts`: Processes responses from document queries.
4. `create-outbound-document-retrieval-req.ts`: Creates document retrieval requests based on query results.
5. `process-outbound-document-retrieval-resps.ts`: Handles responses from document retrieval requests.
6. `shared.ts`: Provides utility functions for handling document references and converting between Carequality and FHIR formats.
7. `get-non-existent-doc-refs.ts`: Identifies document references that are missing from S3 storage.
8. `filter-oids-by-managing-org.ts`: Filters Carequality links based on managing organizations.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several key dependencies:

1. `@metriport/core`: Provides core utilities and functions used throughout the codebase.
2. `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk`: Offers data models and functions for interacting with IHE gateways.
3. `@medplum/fhirtypes`: Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources.
4. `@sentry/node`: Used for error logging and monitoring.
5. `dayjs`: A library for date and time manipulation.
6. `lodash`: Provides utility functions for various operations.
7. `sequelize`: An ORM for database interactions.

## Configuration
The code uses various configuration settings, including:

1. Feature flags for enabling/disabling Carequality Direct and IHE DQ result polling.
2. AWS configuration for S3 bucket access.
3. Document reference limits per request, which can be gateway-specific.
4. System usernames and other Carequality-specific settings.

These configurations are typically accessed through a `Config` object or environment variables.

In summary, this directory contains the core functionality for interacting with Carequality to query and retrieve patient documents, process them, and store them in FHIR format. It handles the complexities of working with multiple external gateways, managing document references, and ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage.
