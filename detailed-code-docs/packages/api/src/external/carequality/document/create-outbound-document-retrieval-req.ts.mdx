## High-level description
The `createOutboundDocumentRetrievalReqs` function is responsible for generating a list of `OutboundDocumentRetrievalReq` objects, which are used to request medical documents from external gateways using the Carequality framework. It processes the results of a previous document query, filters out results with invalid gateways, and chunks document references based on gateway-specific limits.

## Code Structure
The `createOutboundDocumentRetrievalReqs` function is the main symbol in this file. It utilizes several helper functions and external libraries to achieve its functionality.

## References
- `OutboundDocumentQueryResp`: Represents the response from a previous document query.
- `OutboundDocumentRetrievalReq`: Represents a request for retrieving documents from an external gateway.
- `getGatewaySpecificDocRefsPerRequest`: A function that determines the maximum number of document references allowed per request for a specific gateway.
- `HieInitiator`: Represents the initiator of the health information exchange (HIE) request.
- `getSystemUserName`: A function that generates a system username based on the organization name.
- `isGWValid`: A function that checks if a gateway is valid.
- `createPurposeOfUse`: A function that creates a `PurposeOfUse` object.
- `capture`: A utility for capturing and logging errors and messages.

## Symbols

### `createOutboundDocumentRetrievalReqs`
#### Description
This function generates an array of `OutboundDocumentRetrievalReq` objects based on the provided `outboundDocumentQueryResults`. It filters out results with invalid gateways and chunks document references according to gateway-specific limits.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requestId | string | The unique identifier for the request. |
| patient | Patient | The patient for whom the documents are being requested. |
| initiator | HieInitiator | The initiator of the HIE request. |
| outboundDocumentQueryResults | OutboundDocumentQueryResp[] | The results of a previous document query. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requestsWithDocRefs | OutboundDocumentRetrievalReq[] | An array of document retrieval requests, each containing a chunk of document references. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
    - Get the current timestamp.
    - Generate a system username using `getSystemUserName`.
    - Initialize an empty array to store patient IDs with invalid gateways.
2. **Iterate through Query Results:**
    - Use `reduce` to iterate through each `outboundDocumentQueryResults`.
    - For each result:
        - Check if the gateway is valid using `isGWValid`.
        - If invalid, log an error and skip to the next result.
        - If valid, create a base request object with common properties.
        - Determine the maximum document references per request using `getGatewaySpecificDocRefsPerRequest`.
        - Chunk the document references into smaller arrays based on the limit.
        - For each chunk, create a new `OutboundDocumentRetrievalReq` object with the base request properties and the chunk of document references.
3. **Handle Invalid Gateways:**
    - If any invalid gateways were encountered, log an error message with relevant details using `capture.message`.
4. **Filter Requests with Document References:**
    - Filter the generated requests to include only those with at least one document reference.
5. **Return Requests:**
    - Return the filtered array of `OutboundDocumentRetrievalReq` objects.

## Side Effects
- Logs error messages if invalid gateways are encountered.

## Error Handling
- Uses `capture.message` to log errors related to invalid gateways.

## Logging
- Uses `console.error` and `capture.message` to log errors related to invalid gateways.
