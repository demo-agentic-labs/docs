## High-level description
This code exports an object `cqCommands` that provides a structured interface to access various Carequality (CQ) related commands. These commands likely interact with external Carequality services to manage patient and organization data.

## Code Structure
The code imports functions related to patient and organization management from other modules. It then structures these functions within the `cqCommands` object, categorizing them by their domain (e.g., `patient`, `organization`). 

## Symbols
### `cqCommands`
#### Description
This object serves as the main interface for accessing Carequality related commands. It groups related commands under specific categories like `patient` and `organization`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cqCommands | object | An object containing functions for interacting with Carequality services, categorized by domain (e.g., `patient`, `organization`). |

#### Internal Logic
The `cqCommands` object is structured as follows:
```
cqCommands = {
  organization: {
    createOrUpdate: organization.createOrUpdateCQOrganization,
  },
  patient: {
    discover: patient.discover,
    remove: patient.remove,
  },
};
```
- **organization**: Contains commands related to managing organizations within Carequality.
    - **createOrUpdate**: This function, imported from `organization.createOrUpdateCQOrganization`, likely handles the creation or updating of organization data within a CQ directory.
- **patient**: Contains commands related to managing patient data within Carequality.
    - **discover**: This function, imported from `patient.discover`, likely handles discovering patient information within Carequality.
    - **remove**: This function, imported from `patient.remove`, likely handles removing patient data from Carequality.

## References
- `./patient`: This module likely contains functions related to managing patient data within Carequality.
- `./command/cq-directory/create-or-update-cq-organization`: This module specifically handles the creation or updating of organization data within a CQ directory.
