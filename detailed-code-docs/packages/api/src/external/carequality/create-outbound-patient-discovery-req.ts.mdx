## High-level description
The `createOutboundPatientDiscoveryReq` function constructs an `OutboundPatientDiscoveryReq` object, which is used to initiate a patient discovery request to external gateways (e.g., Carequality). This request includes patient demographics, the requesting organization's information, and the target gateways.

## References

- `XCPDGateway`: Type definition from `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk` representing a gateway in the context of cross-community patient discovery (XCPD).
- `PatientResource`: Type definition from `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk` representing patient demographic information.
- `HieInitiator`: Type definition representing the healthcare organization initiating the HIE request.
- `createPurposeOfUse`: Function (defined in `./shared.ts`) that determines and formats the purpose of use for the request.

## Symbols
### `createOutboundPatientDiscoveryReq`
#### Description
This function creates an `OutboundPatientDiscoveryReq` object populated with data from the provided parameters. This object is used to initiate a patient discovery request to external gateways.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientResource | `PatientResource` | Patient demographic information to include in the request. |
| cxId | `string` | Unique identifier of the customer. |
| patientId | `string` | Unique identifier of the patient. |
| xcpdGateways | `XCPDGateway[]` | Array of target gateways for the patient discovery request. |
| initiator | `HieInitiator` | Information about the healthcare organization initiating the request. |
| requestId | `string` | Unique identifier for the request. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | `OutboundPatientDiscoveryReq` | An object representing the outbound patient discovery request. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Generate system user name:** Calls `getSystemUserName` to create a user name string based on the initiator's organization name.
2. **Construct request object:** Creates an `OutboundPatientDiscoveryReq` object and populates its properties:
    - `id`: Set to the provided `requestId`.
    - `cxId`: Set to the provided `cxId`.
    - `patientId`: Set to the provided `patientId`.
    - `timestamp`: Set to the current timestamp using `dayjs().toISOString()`.
    - `gateways`: Set to the provided `xcpdGateways` array.
    - `principalCareProviderIds`: Set to an array containing the initiator's NPI (National Provider Identifier).
    - `samlAttributes`: An object containing SAML attributes for the request:
        - `subjectId`: Set to the generated system user name.
        - `subjectRole`: Hardcoded to "Administrative AND/OR managerial worker" with code "106331006".
        - `organization`: Set to the initiator's name.
        - `organizationId`: Set to the initiator's OID (Organization Identifier).
        - `homeCommunityId`: Set to the initiator's OID.
        - `purposeOfUse`: Set by calling `createPurposeOfUse` to determine and format the purpose of use.
    - `patientResource`: Set to the provided `patientResource` object.
3. **Return request object:** Returns the constructed `OutboundPatientDiscoveryReq` object.

## Dependencies
- `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk`: Provides types and potentially functionality related to IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) gateways.
- `dayjs`: Used for handling dates and times, specifically for generating the timestamp.

## Error Handling
This function does not implement specific error handling beyond potential exceptions thrown by dependencies.
