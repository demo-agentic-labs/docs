## High-level description
The `OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel` class represents the structure and behavior of outbound patient discovery responses within the application's database. It defines the schema for storing these responses, including fields for the request ID, patient ID, status, and the actual response data. This model facilitates the persistence and retrieval of patient discovery results obtained from external systems.

## Code Structure
The `OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel` extends the `Model` class from Sequelize and implements the `OutboundPatientDiscoveryResp` interface. It defines properties for each field in the database table and uses the `ModelSetup` function to define the table structure and configuration within the Sequelize ORM.

## References
- `OutboundPatientDiscoveryResp` interface from `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk` - Defines the structure of the response data.
- `Model`, `DataTypes`, `Sequelize`, `CreationOptional` from `sequelize` - Used for defining the database model and its properties.
- `ModelSetup` from `../../../models/_default` - A type definition for the model setup function.

## Symbols

### `OutboundPatientDiscoveryRespModel`
#### Description
This class defines the database model for outbound patient discovery responses. It specifies the structure of the database table and provides methods for interacting with it.

#### Inputs
This class does not directly accept inputs. It is used by other parts of the code to interact with the database.

#### Outputs
This class does not directly return outputs. It provides methods for retrieving and storing data in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `setup` method defines the table structure and configuration using Sequelize:
- Defines each column and its data type.
- Sets the primary key.
- Configures table name, timestamps, and other options.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sequelize | Object-relational mapper (ORM) for interacting with the database. |
| @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk | Provides the interface for the outbound patient discovery response data. |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling. Any errors during database operations will be handled by Sequelize or propagated to the calling code.
