## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript interfaces and a type alias that represent entries in the Carequality Directory. These entries contain information about healthcare organizations, including their contact details, location, and Carequality capabilities.

## Code Structure
The code defines three symbols: `CQDirectoryEntryData`, `CQDirectoryEntryCreate`, and `CQDirectoryEntry`. `CQDirectoryEntryData` is a simple interface defining the data structure of a directory entry. `CQDirectoryEntryCreate` extends `CQDirectoryEntryData` and `BaseDomainCreate` (from another file), adding an `id` field. Finally, `CQDirectoryEntry` extends both `CQDirectoryEntryCreate` and `BaseDomain`, inheriting all their properties.

## References
- `BaseDomain` and `BaseDomainCreate` are referenced from `@metriport/core/domain/base-domain`.
- `Organization` is referenced from `@metriport/carequality-sdk/models/organization`.
