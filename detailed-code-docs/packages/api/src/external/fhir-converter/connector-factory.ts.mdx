## High-level description
This code defines a factory function `makeFHIRConverterConnector()` that creates and returns an instance of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) converter connector. The function selects between two different implementations based on the environment configuration.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary dependencies and defines a single factory function. The function uses the `Config` class to determine the environment and returns the appropriate connector implementation.

## Symbols

### `makeFHIRConverterConnector()`
#### Description
This function is a factory that creates and returns an instance of a FHIR converter connector. It determines which implementation to use based on the environment configuration.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | FHIRConverterConnector | An instance of either FHIRConverterConnectorHTTP or FHIRConverterConnectorSQS |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function checks if the current environment is a cloud environment using `Config.isCloudEnv()`.
2. If it's not a cloud environment, it returns a new instance of `FHIRConverterConnectorHTTP`.
3. If it is a cloud environment, it returns a new instance of `FHIRConverterConnectorSQS`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Config | Used to check the environment configuration |
| FHIRConverterConnector | Interface implemented by both connector types |
| FHIRConverterConnectorHTTP | HTTP implementation of the FHIR converter connector |
| FHIRConverterConnectorSQS | SQS (Simple Queue Service) implementation of the FHIR converter connector |

## Notes
1. The code uses a factory pattern to create the appropriate connector based on the environment.
2. The `FHIRConverterConnectorHTTP` is used for non-cloud environments, which might be useful for local development or testing.
3. The `FHIRConverterConnectorSQS` is used for cloud environments, suggesting that in production, the FHIR conversion requests are handled through an AWS SQS queue.
4. The actual implementations of `FHIRConverterConnectorHTTP` and `FHIRConverterConnectorSQS` are not provided in this file, but they both implement the `FHIRConverterConnector` interface.
5. The `Config` class is used to determine the environment, with `isCloudEnv()` likely checking if the environment is set to production or a cloud-based staging environment.

This factory function allows the application to switch between different FHIR converter implementations seamlessly based on the deployment environment, promoting flexibility and easier testing/development workflows.
