## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) converter connector. It provides functionality to convert medical data, particularly Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents, to FHIR format. The code is designed to work in different environments (cloud and non-cloud) and includes both HTTP and AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service) based implementations.

## What does it do?
The FHIR converter connector facilitates the conversion of medical data from various formats (currently focusing on CDA) to FHIR format. Here's a simplified workflow:

1. A request to convert a document is received, containing details like patient ID, document ID, and the source data.
2. The system determines whether to use the HTTP-based or SQS-based connector, depending on the environment.
3. For HTTP-based conversions, it sends a direct request to a FHIR Converter server.
4. For SQS-based conversions, it queues the conversion request in an AWS SQS queue for asynchronous processing.
5. The converted FHIR data is then stored or processed as needed.

This process allows for flexible handling of medical data conversion, supporting both synchronous (HTTP) and asynchronous (SQS) workflows, which is crucial for scalability and reliability in different deployment scenarios.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this module is the `convertCDAToFHIR` function in the `converter.ts` file. This function orchestrates the conversion process, utilizing the appropriate connector based on the environment.

The connector implementation is determined by the `makeFHIRConverterConnector` factory function in `connector-factory.ts`. This function returns either an HTTP-based or SQS-based connector, depending on whether the application is running in a cloud environment.

Data flow typically starts with a conversion request, which is then routed through the appropriate connector. For HTTP-based conversions, the data is sent directly to the FHIR Converter server. For SQS-based conversions, the request is queued for asynchronous processing.

## Key Files
1. `connector.ts`: Defines the core interface `FHIRConverterConnector` and types used throughout the module.

2. `connector-factory.ts`: Contains the factory function `makeFHIRConverterConnector` that creates the appropriate connector based on the environment.

3. `connector-http.ts`: Implements the HTTP-based connector `FHIRConverterConnectorHTTP`, which sends direct requests to the FHIR Converter server.

4. `connector-sqs.ts`: Implements the SQS-based connector `FHIRConverterConnectorSQS`, which queues conversion requests in AWS SQS.

5. `converter.ts`: Contains the main `convertCDAToFHIR` function and related utilities for managing the conversion process.

## Dependencies
The module relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. axios: Used for making HTTP requests in the HTTP-based connector.
2. @aws-sdk/client-sqs: Likely used for interacting with AWS SQS (though not directly visible in the provided code snippets).
3. dayjs: Used for date and time manipulation.
4. @metriport/core: Provides core functionality and types used throughout the module.
5. @metriport/commonwell-sdk: Used in the conversion process, likely for handling CommonWell Health Alliance related data.

## Configuration
The module uses a `Config` class to manage environment-specific settings. Key configuration options include:

1. `FHIR_CONVERTER_SERVER_URL`: The URL of the FHIR Converter server.
2. `FHIR_CONVERTER_QUEUE_URL`: The URL of the SQS queue for FHIR conversion requests.

The `Config.isCloudEnv()` method is used to determine whether the application is running in a cloud environment, which affects the choice of connector.

## Error Handling and Logging
The module includes error handling and logging throughout its components:

1. In the HTTP connector, errors are logged when the FHIR Converter server URL is not configured or when there are issues with S3 bucket or file names.
2. The SQS connector logs messages when required configuration is missing.
3. The main conversion function in `converter.ts` includes comprehensive error handling, capturing and logging errors that occur during the conversion process.

Logging is primarily done using `console.log`, though there are mentions of a `capture.error` function for more detailed error reporting.

The module demonstrates a well-structured approach to handling medical data conversion, with clear separation of concerns between different connector types and a flexible factory pattern for instantiation. The use of TypeScript provides strong typing, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.
