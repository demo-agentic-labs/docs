## High-level description
This code implements functionality for processing and managing Continuity of Care Documents (CCDs) and other medical documents within a healthcare data management system. It includes operations such as generating CCDs, uploading documents, querying document statuses, and handling data contributions from various sources.

## Code Structure
The main file (`process-ccd-request.ts`) contains functions for processing CCD requests and generating empty CCDs. It interacts with other modules for patient and organization data, document uploading, and error handling. The related files provide supporting functionality for document management, data conversion, and API endpoints.

## Symbols

### `processCcdRequest`
#### Description
Generates a CCD for a given patient and organization, then uploads it to a specified S3 bucket.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | Patient data |
| organization | Organization | Organization data |
| requestId | string (optional) | Unique identifier for the request |

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a CCD using the `generateCcd` function
2. Creates a document reference
3. Uploads the CCD using `cdaDocumentUploaderHandler`
4. Logs the process and handles errors

### `processEmptyCcdRequest`
#### Description
Generates an empty CCD for a given patient and organization, then uploads it to a specified S3 bucket.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | Patient data |
| organization | Organization | Organization data |

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `processCcdRequest`, but uses `generateEmptyCcd` instead of `generateCcd`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | FHIR type definitions |
| @metriport/core | Core functionality and utilities |
| aws-sdk | AWS SDK for S3 operations |

## Configuration
The code uses environment variables for configuration, accessed through the `Config` class. Key configurations include:
- AWS region
- S3 bucket names
- API URLs and endpoints

## Error Handling
Errors are captured and logged using a custom `capture.error` function. Specific error types (e.g., `BadRequestError`) are used for different scenarios.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging utility (`out`) for consistent log formatting across the application.

## API/Interface Reference
This file doesn't directly expose an API, but it provides core functionality used by API endpoints defined in related files (e.g., `internal-docs.ts`).

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the main file, but there's a comment about keeping old logic for backward compatibility:
```typescript
// keeping the old logic for now, but we should avoid having these optional parameters that can
// lead to empty string or `undefined` being used as IDs
```

This suggests that there might be plans to refactor this part of the code in the future.
