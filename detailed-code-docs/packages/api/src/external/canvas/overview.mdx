## High-level description
The code defines an event listener that listens for `CANVAS_INTEGRATION` events. When triggered, it retrieves patient data, interacts with the Canvas SDK to create a note, and adds medical data (allergies, conditions, medications) to the patient's record in Canvas.

## Code Structure
The `canvas-event-listener.ts` file defines a default function that sets up an event listener using `patientEvents().on`. This listener waits for `PatientEvents.CANVAS_INTEGRATION` events. Upon receiving an event, it validates the event, retrieves patient information, initializes the Canvas SDK, and then calls `createFullNote` to populate the patient's Canvas record.

### `default`
#### Description
This is the default exported function that sets up the Canvas event listener. It listens for `CANVAS_INTEGRATION` events and processes them to create notes and add medical data to a patient's record in Canvas.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any direct inputs. It is called when the `patientEvents` EventEmitter emits a `CANVAS_INTEGRATION` event.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Event Listener Setup:**
   - Uses `patientEvents().on` to listen for `PatientEvents.CANVAS_INTEGRATION` events.
2. **Event Validation (`isCanvasIntegrationEvent`):**
   - Checks if the event is a valid Canvas integration event based on environment and metadata.
3. **Patient Data Retrieval:**
   - Fetches patient details using `getPatientOrFail` based on the event's `id` and `cxId`.
4. **Canvas SDK Initialization:**
   - Retrieves Canvas API credentials from environment variables.
   - Creates a new instance of the `CanvasSDK` using these credentials.
5. **Note Creation and Data Population (`createFullNote`):**
   - Calls the `createFullNote` function to create a note in Canvas and populate it with the patient's medical data.

## Side Effects
- Creates a note and adds medical data (allergies, conditions, medications) to a patient's record in Canvas.

## TODOs
- Remove the demo patient check (patientA, patientB) as per the mentioned GitHub issue.
