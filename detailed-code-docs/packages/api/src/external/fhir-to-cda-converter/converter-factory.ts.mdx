## High-level description
This code defines a factory function `makeFhirToCdaConverter()` that creates and returns an instance of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) converter. The factory function determines which implementation of the converter to use based on the current environment.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary dependencies and defines a factory function that returns an instance of `FhirToCdaConverter`. The function uses the `Config` class to determine the environment and returns the appropriate converter implementation.

## References
- `Config` from "../../shared/config"
- `FhirToCdaConverter` interface from "./connector"
- `FhirToCdaConverterDirect` class from "./connector-direct"
- `FhirToCdaConverterLambda` class from "./connector-lambda"

## Symbols

### `makeFhirToCdaConverter()`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an instance of `FhirToCdaConverter`. It determines which implementation to use based on the current environment.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| converter | FhirToCdaConverter | An instance of FhirToCdaConverter |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the current environment is a cloud environment using `Config.isCloudEnv()`.
2. If it's not a cloud environment, return a new instance of `FhirToCdaConverterDirect`.
3. If it is a cloud environment, return a new instance of `FhirToCdaConverterLambda`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Config | Used to determine the current environment |
| FhirToCdaConverter | Interface implemented by converter classes |
| FhirToCdaConverterDirect | Direct implementation of the converter |
| FhirToCdaConverterLambda | Lambda-based implementation of the converter |

## Performance Considerations
The factory function uses a simple conditional statement to determine which implementation to use, so its performance impact is minimal. The main performance considerations would be in the actual implementations of `FhirToCdaConverterDirect` and `FhirToCdaConverterLambda`, which are not shown in this file.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement any explicit error handling. If there are issues creating the converter instances, they would be propagated to the caller of `makeFhirToCdaConverter()`.

## API/Interface Reference
The `FhirToCdaConverter` interface is not defined in this file, but it's likely that both `FhirToCdaConverterDirect` and `FhirToCdaConverterLambda` implement this interface. The interface probably defines methods for converting FHIR data to CDA format.
