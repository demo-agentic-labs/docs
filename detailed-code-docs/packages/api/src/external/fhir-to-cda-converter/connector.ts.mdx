## High-level description
This code defines the interface and request structure for a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) converter. It provides a type definition for the converter request and an interface for the converter itself, which is designed to handle the conversion process asynchronously.

## Symbols

### `FhirToCdaConverterRequest`
#### Description
This type defines the structure of a request to convert FHIR data to CDA format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | Likely a customer or context identifier |
| splitCompositions | boolean | Indicates whether to split the bundle based on Compositions |
| bundle | Bundle | The FHIR bundle to be converted |

#### Internal Logic
The `splitCompositions` field is particularly noteworthy as it determines whether the bundle should be split based on Compositions prior to conversion. This is explicitly set to `false` for CCD (Continuity of Care Document) generation.

### `FhirToCdaConverter`
#### Description
This interface defines the contract for a FHIR to CDA converter implementation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | FhirToCdaConverterRequest | The request object containing the FHIR bundle and conversion options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;string[]&gt; | Promise&lt;string[]&gt; | A promise that resolves to an array of strings, likely representing the converted CDA documents |

#### Internal Logic
The `requestConvert` method is asynchronous, indicating that the conversion process may take some time and is handled in a non-blocking manner.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Imports the `Bundle` type from the FHIR schemas |

## References
The code references the `Bundle` type from `"../../routes/medical/schemas/fhir"`, which is defined in one of the related code snippets. This `Bundle` type represents a FHIR bundle, which is a collection of resources that are used as input for the conversion process.

## Related Code Context
1. The `fhir.ts` file defines the `Bundle` type used in this converter interface. It includes schemas for validating FHIR bundle structures.

2. The `connector-lambda.ts` file provides an implementation of the `FhirToCdaConverter` interface using AWS Lambda. It demonstrates how the converter might be used in practice, invoking a Lambda function to perform the actual conversion.

This modular design allows for different implementations of the FHIR to CDA conversion process while maintaining a consistent interface, which promotes flexibility and easier testing of the conversion functionality.
