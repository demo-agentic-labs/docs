## High-level description
This directory contains code for converting FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture for handling this conversion process, with implementations for both direct conversion and AWS Lambda-based conversion.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the conversion of healthcare data from FHIR format to CDA format. This conversion is crucial for interoperability between different healthcare systems and standards. The process involves:

1. Receiving FHIR bundles as input
2. Optionally splitting these bundles based on compositions
3. Converting the FHIR data to CDA format
4. Returning the converted CDA documents

The system is designed to work in different environments, with a direct conversion method for local or non-cloud environments, and a Lambda-based method for cloud environments. This flexibility allows for scalable and efficient processing depending on the deployment context.

## Entry points
The main entry point for using this conversion functionality is the `makeFhirToCdaConverter()` factory function in `converter-factory.ts`. This function determines the appropriate converter implementation based on the current environment and returns an instance of the `FhirToCdaConverter` interface.

The core interface for the conversion process is defined in `connector.ts`, which specifies the `FhirToCdaConverter` interface and the `FhirToCdaConverterRequest` type. This provides a consistent contract for different implementations of the converter.

## Key Files
1. `connector.ts`: Defines the main interface `FhirToCdaConverter` and the request type `FhirToCdaConverterRequest`. This serves as the contract for the conversion process.

2. `connector-direct.ts`: Implements the `FhirToCdaConverterDirect` class, which provides a direct method for converting FHIR to CDA. This is used in non-cloud environments.

3. `connector-lambda.ts`: Implements the `FhirToCdaConverterLambda` class, which uses AWS Lambda for the conversion process. This is used in cloud environments for scalable processing.

4. `converter-factory.ts`: Contains the `makeFhirToCdaConverter()` factory function, which creates the appropriate converter instance based on the environment.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `@metriport/core`: Provides utility functions and types for FHIR to CDA conversion and AWS Lambda interactions.
2. `aws-sdk`: Used for invoking AWS Lambda functions in the cloud-based implementation.
3. Internal modules:
   - `@metriport/core/fhir-to-cda/composition-splitter`
   - `@metriport/core/fhir-to-cda/fhir-to-cda`
   - `../../command/medical/organization/get-organization`
   - `../../shared/config`

## Configuration
The system uses configuration values from the `Config` class, particularly:

- `FHIR_TO_CDA_CONVERTER_LAMBDA_NAME`: Specifies the name of the AWS Lambda function for FHIR to CDA conversion in cloud environments.
- `Config.isCloudEnv()`: Determines whether the current environment is a cloud environment.

Additionally, the conversion process can be configured with:

- `splitCompositions`: A boolean flag in the conversion request that determines whether to split the FHIR bundle based on compositions before conversion.

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily delegated to the individual converter implementations. The Lambda-based implementation uses the `getLambdaResultPayload` function to handle potential errors from Lambda invocations. The direct implementation does not implement explicit error handling, allowing errors to propagate up the call stack.

In conclusion, this directory provides a robust and flexible system for converting FHIR data to CDA format, with different implementations to suit various deployment environments. The modular design allows for easy extension and maintenance of the conversion process.
