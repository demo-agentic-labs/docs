## High-level description
This code defines functions to convert an Organization object to a FHIR Organization resource and to append an identifier OID to a FHIR Organization resource. It serves as a bridge between the application's internal Organization model and the FHIR standard for healthcare data exchange.

## Symbols

### `toFHIR`
#### Description
This function converts an Organization object from the application's domain model to a FHIR Organization resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | Organization | The organization object to be converted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| FHIROrganization | FHIROrganization | The converted FHIR Organization resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new FHIROrganization object with the following properties:
   - `resourceType`: Set to "Organization"
   - `id`: Set to the organization's id
   - `active`: Set to true
   - `type`: An array with a single object containing the organization's type
   - `name`: Set to the organization's name
   - `address`: An array with a single address object containing the organization's location details

### `appendIdentifierOID`
#### Description
This function adds an identifier OID to a FHIR Organization resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | Organization | The original organization object |
| fhirOrg | FHIROrganization | The FHIR Organization resource to be modified |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| FHIROrganization | FHIROrganization | The modified FHIR Organization resource with the added identifier |

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds an `identifier` property to the `fhirOrg` object with a single element containing the organization's OID as its value.
2. Returns the modified `fhirOrg` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/organization | Imports the Organization type |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Imports the FHIR Organization type |

## References
This code is referenced in other parts of the application, specifically:
- In `packages/api/src/command/medical/patient/handle-data-contributions.ts`, the `toFHIR` function is used to convert an organization to its FHIR representation.
- In `packages/api/src/external/fhir/document/draft-update-document-reference.ts`, both `toFHIR` and `appendIdentifierOID` functions are used in the process of composing a DocumentReference.

These references indicate that this code plays a crucial role in the application's FHIR data handling and conversion processes, particularly when dealing with organization data in the context of patient records and document references.
