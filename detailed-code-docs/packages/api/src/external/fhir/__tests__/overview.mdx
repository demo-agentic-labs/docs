## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the FHIR admin functionality in the Metriport API. It tests the creation of tenants and the safe creation of tenants (creating only if they don't exist) using mocked FHIR admin client methods.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are test cases that interact with mocked versions of `HapiFhirAdminClient` methods. The tests use Jest for mocking and assertions.

## Symbols

### `beforeAll()`
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by restoring all mocks, mocking the `Config.getFHIRServerUrl` method, and creating mock implementations for `createTenant` and `listTenants` methods of `HapiFhirAdminClient`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Restores all mocks
2. Mocks `Config.getFHIRServerUrl` to return a local URL
3. Creates mock implementations for `createTenant` and `listTenants`

### `afterAll()`
#### Description
Cleans up the test environment by restoring all mocks.

### `beforeEach()`
#### Description
Clears all mocks before each test.

### Test: "createTenant"
#### Description
Tests the `createTenant` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `createTenant` with organization number and customer ID
2. Expects the function to resolve without throwing an error
3. Checks if the mock `createTenant` method was called with the correct parameters

### Test: "createTenantSafe when tenant exists"
#### Description
Tests the `createTenantIfNotExists` function when the tenant already exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks `listTenants` to return an array including the test customer ID
2. Calls `createTenantIfNotExists` with organization number and customer ID
3. Expects the function to resolve without throwing an error
4. Checks if `listTenants` was called once and `createTenant` was not called

### Test: "createTenantSafe when tenant does not exists"
#### Description
Tests the `createTenantIfNotExists` function when the tenant does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks `listTenants` to return an array not including the test customer ID
2. Calls `createTenantIfNotExists` with organization number and customer ID
3. Expects the function to resolve without throwing an error
4. Checks if `listTenants` was called once and `createTenant` was called with the correct parameters

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/external/fhir/api/api-hapi | Imports `HapiFhirAdminClient` for mocking |
| uuid | Generates unique IDs for testing |
| ../../../domain/medical/__tests__/organization | Imports `makeOrgNumber` for generating test organization numbers |
| ../../../shared/config | Imports `Config` for mocking FHIR server URL |
| ../admin | Imports `createTenant` and `createTenantIfNotExists` functions being tested |

## Configuration
The tests use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate the functions being tested from external dependencies.
