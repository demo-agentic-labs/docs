## High-level description
This code defines a `FHIRServerConnectorHTTP` class that implements the `FHIRServerConnector` interface. It provides functionality to upsert a batch of FHIR resources to a FHIR server using HTTP requests. The class handles downloading payload data from S3, parsing it, and sending it to the FHIR server using the MedplumClient.

## Code Structure
The main class `FHIRServerConnectorHTTP` implements the `FHIRServerConnector` interface. It contains a single method `upsertBatch` which orchestrates the process of retrieving data from S3 and sending it to the FHIR server.

## References
- `Config`: Used to get the FHIR server URL.
- `Util`: Used for logging.
- `makeS3Client`: Used to create an S3 client for downloading files.
- `MedplumClient`: Used to interact with the FHIR server.

## Symbols

### FHIRServerConnectorHTTP
#### Description
A class that implements the `FHIRServerConnector` interface, providing HTTP-based communication with a FHIR server.

#### Inputs
None (for the class itself)

#### Outputs
None (for the class itself)

### upsertBatch
#### Description
An asynchronous method that handles the process of upserting a batch of FHIR resources to the FHIR server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | Customer ID |
| patientId | string | Patient ID |
| payload | string | JSON string containing S3 bucket and file name information |
| requestId | string | Request ID for logging purposes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the batch upsert is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the FHIR server URL from the configuration.
2. Parses the payload to extract S3 bucket and file name information.
3. Creates an S3 client and downloads the file from S3.
4. Parses the downloaded data to extract the FHIR resource batch.
5. Creates a MedplumClient instance with the FHIR server URL and customer-specific path.
6. Executes the batch operation on the FHIR server using the MedplumClient.

## Side Effects
- Downloads a file from S3.
- Sends HTTP requests to a FHIR server.
- Logs operations and errors.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/core | Provides the MedplumClient for interacting with FHIR servers |
| aws-sdk | Implied dependency for S3 operations (via makeS3Client) |

## Error Handling
The code throws errors in the following cases:
- Missing S3 bucket name or file name in the payload.
- Missing body in the S3 object response.

These errors are not caught within the method, so they will propagate to the caller.

## Logging
The code uses the `Util.out` method for logging, which likely provides structured logging. It logs the following events:
- Start of the upsert batch operation, including patientId, requestId, and s3FileName.
- Downloading from S3.
- Sending payload to the FHIR server.
- Completion of the operation.

## Performance Considerations
- The code downloads potentially large files from S3 and keeps them in memory. For very large files, this could lead to high memory usage.
- The entire batch operation is sent as a single request to the FHIR server, which could be time-consuming for large batches.
