## High-level description
This code defines a `FHIRServerConnectorSQS` class that implements the `FHIRServerConnector` interface. It provides functionality to send FHIR server requests to an AWS SQS queue for batch processing.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `FHIRServerConnectorSQS` class, which implements the `upsertBatch` method from the `FHIRServerConnector` interface. This method uses the `sendMessageToQueue` function from the AWS SQS utility to send messages to a specified queue.

## References
- `Config` from "../../../shared/config"
- `sendMessageToQueue` from "../../aws/sqs"
- `FHIRServerConnector`, `FHIRServerRequest`, `createJobId` from "./connector"

## Symbols

### FHIRServerConnectorSQS
#### Description
A class that implements the `FHIRServerConnector` interface, providing a method to send FHIR server requests to an AWS SQS queue.

#### Methods

##### upsertBatch
###### Description
Sends a batch of FHIR server requests to an AWS SQS queue.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| { cxId, patientId, documentId, payload, requestId } | FHIRServerRequest | An object containing the request details |

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the message is sent to the queue |

###### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the FHIR server queue URL using `Config.getFHIRServerQueueURL()`.
2. Calls `sendMessageToQueue` with the queue URL, payload, and message attributes.
3. Message attributes include `cxId`, `patientId`, `jobId` (created using `createJobId`), and `startedAt` (current UTC timestamp).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dayjs | Used for date and time manipulation |
| @metriport/core | Provides configuration utilities |
| aws-sdk | Used for interacting with AWS SQS |

## Configuration
The code relies on the `Config` class to retrieve the FHIR server queue URL. This URL is expected to be set in the environment variables and accessible through the `Config` class.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Errors that occur during the SQS message sending process will be propagated to the caller.

## Performance Considerations
The `upsertBatch` method is asynchronous, allowing for non-blocking execution. However, the performance of this connector depends on the responsiveness of the AWS SQS service and the network latency between the application and AWS.
