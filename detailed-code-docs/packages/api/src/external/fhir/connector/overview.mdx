## High-level description
This directory contains code for connecting to and interacting with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) servers. It provides a flexible architecture that supports different connection methods based on the environment (cloud or non-cloud) and implements batch operations for upserting FHIR resources.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates communication between an application and FHIR servers, which are used for storing and exchanging healthcare data. It provides two main ways of interacting with FHIR servers:

1. Direct HTTP communication: For non-cloud environments, it sends HTTP requests directly to the FHIR server.
2. AWS SQS queue: For cloud environments, it sends messages to an AWS SQS queue, which can then be processed asynchronously.

The main functionality includes:
- Creating a FHIR server connector based on the current environment.
- Upserting (inserting or updating) batches of FHIR resources.
- Handling data stored in AWS S3 buckets.
- Creating and parsing job IDs for tracking requests and documents.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `connector-factory.ts` file, which contains the `makeFHIRServerConnector()` function. This function determines which type of connector to use based on the environment.

The data flow typically follows these steps:
1. The application calls `makeFHIRServerConnector()` to get the appropriate connector.
2. The application uses the connector's `upsertBatch()` method to send data to the FHIR server.
3. Depending on the environment:
   - In non-cloud environments, `FHIRServerConnectorHTTP` downloads data from S3 and sends it directly to the FHIR server.
   - In cloud environments, `FHIRServerConnectorSQS` sends a message to an AWS SQS queue for later processing.

## Key Files
1. `connector-factory.ts`: Creates the appropriate FHIR server connector based on the environment.
2. `connector-http.ts`: Implements the HTTP-based connector for direct communication with FHIR servers.
3. `connector-sqs.ts`: Implements the SQS-based connector for cloud environments.
4. `connector.ts`: Defines common interfaces and utility functions used by the connectors.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. @medplum/core (version not specified): Provides the `MedplumClient` for interacting with FHIR servers.
   - Chosen for its FHIR-specific functionality and ease of use.

2. aws-sdk (version not specified): Used for interacting with AWS services like S3 and SQS.
   - Chosen as the official SDK for AWS services.

3. dayjs (version not specified): Used for date and time manipulation.
   - Chosen for its lightweight and efficient date handling capabilities.

4. @metriport/core (version not specified): Provides configuration utilities.
   - Likely an internal library for managing application configuration.

## Configuration
The connectors rely on configuration provided by the `Config` class, which is imported from a shared configuration file. Key configuration options include:

1. `isCloudEnv()`: Determines whether the application is running in a cloud environment.
2. `getFHIRServerQueueURL()`: Retrieves the URL for the AWS SQS queue used in cloud environments.
3. FHIR server URL: Used for direct HTTP communication in non-cloud environments.

These configuration options are typically set through environment variables, allowing for easy deployment to different environments.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `makeFHIRServerConnector()` function might be used:

```typescript
import { makeFHIRServerConnector } from './connector-factory';

async function upsertPatientData(patientId: string, data: string) {
  const connector = makeFHIRServerConnector();
  await connector.upsertBatch({
    cxId: 'customer123',
    patientId,
    documentId: 'doc456',
    payload: data,
    requestId: 'req789'
  });
}
```

This code creates the appropriate connector based on the environment and uses it to upsert a batch of patient data.

The `FHIRServerConnectorHTTP` class handles downloading data from S3 and sending it to the FHIR server:

```typescript
async upsertBatch({ cxId, patientId, payload, requestId }: FHIRServerRequest): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
  const fhirServerURL = Config.getFHIRServerURL();
  const { s3BucketName, s3FileName } = JSON.parse(payload);
  
  const s3Client = makeS3Client();
  const data = await s3Client.getObject({ Bucket: s3BucketName, Key: s3FileName }).promise();
  
  const batch = JSON.parse(data.Body as string);
  
  const medplumClient = new MedplumClient({ baseUrl: fhirServerURL });
  await medplumClient.executeBatch(batch);
}
```

This method downloads the data from S3, parses it, and sends it to the FHIR server using the MedplumClient.

The code also includes utility functions for creating and parsing job IDs:

```typescript
export function createJobId(requestId: string | undefined, documentId: string): string {
  return `${requestId ?? ''}_${documentId}`;
}

export function parseJobId(jobId: string | undefined): { requestId?: string; documentId?: string } | undefined {
  if (!jobId) return undefined;
  const [requestId, documentId] = jobId.split('_');
  return { requestId, documentId };
}
```

These functions are used to create unique identifiers for jobs and parse them back into their constituent parts.

In summary, this directory provides a flexible and extensible system for interacting with FHIR servers, supporting both direct HTTP communication and cloud-based message queuing. It handles the complexities of working with healthcare data in different environments, making it easier for developers to build applications that integrate with FHIR-compliant systems.
