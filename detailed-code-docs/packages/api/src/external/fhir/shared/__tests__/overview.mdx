## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) shared functionality in the API. It includes tests for date-related utilities and error mapping functions used in FHIR operations.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory ensure the correct functioning of two main components:

1. Date Utilities: It tests a function that creates FHIR Period objects with random or specified start and end dates. This is useful for generating mock data in FHIR-related tests.

2. Error Mapping: It verifies the functionality of error parsing and grouping for FHIR-related errors. This includes testing various error scenarios such as FHIR-specific errors, timeout errors, and unknown errors.

These tests help maintain the reliability and correctness of FHIR-related operations in the API, particularly in handling dates and managing errors.

## Key Files

### date.ts
This file contains utility functions for creating FHIR Period objects. The main function, `makePeriod`, generates Period objects with random or specified start and end dates. It's primarily used for creating mock data in tests.

Key features:
- Uses the Faker library to generate random dates
- Allows partial override of Period object properties
- Ensures start date is before end date
- Converts dates to ISO string format

Example usage:
```typescript
const period = makePeriod({ start: '2023-01-01' });
// Returns a Period object with the specified start date and a random end date
```

### error-mapping.test.ts
This file contains unit tests for FHIR error mapping functionality. It tests two main functions: `tryDetermineFhirError` and `groupFHIRErrors`.

Key test scenarios:
- FHIR-related errors with single and multiple issues
- Timeout errors
- Unknown errors
- Grouping of FHIR error mappings based on resource type and element

Example test:
```typescript
it("should return a FhirErrorMapping for a FHIR-related error", () =&gt; {
  const error = new OperationOutcomeError(toOperationOutcome([
    {
      severity: "error",
      code: "invalid",
      diagnostics: "Invalid resource",
    },
  ]));
  const result = tryDetermineFhirError(error);
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(result?.message).toBe("Invalid resource");
});
```

## Dependencies
- @faker-js/faker: Used for generating random dates in the `makePeriod` function.
- @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides FHIR-related type definitions.
- @medplum/core: Provides `OperationOutcomeError` for error handling.
- uuid: Used for generating unique identifiers in tests.
- @metriport/core/external/fhir/shared/index: Provides utility functions for FHIR operations.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables used in these test files. The tests rely on the configuration of the larger project and the Jest testing framework.

These tests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of FHIR-related functionality in the API, particularly in handling dates and managing errors. They cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases, helping to maintain the robustness of the FHIR implementation.
