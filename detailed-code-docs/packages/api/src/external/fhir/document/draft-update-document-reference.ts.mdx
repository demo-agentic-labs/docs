## High-level description
This code defines functions for creating and manipulating FHIR DocumentReference resources, specifically for handling temporary document references during the upload process. It includes utility functions for composing document references, checking their validity, and managing identifiers and extensions.

## Code Structure
The main function `composeDocumentReference` creates a DocumentReference with a temporary status and placeholder attachment. It uses several helper functions to construct different parts of the DocumentReference, such as `getMasterIdentifier`, `getIdentifiers`, `getContained`, `getExtensions`, and `getContent`.

## Symbols

### `docRefCheck`
#### Description
Validates that a DocumentReference has the required fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| docRef | DocumentReference | The DocumentReference to validate |

#### Internal Logic
Checks for the presence of `description`, `type`, and `context` fields in the DocumentReference. Throws a BadRequestError if any are missing.

### `composeDocumentReference`
#### Description
Creates a DocumentReference with a temporary status and placeholder attachment for use during the upload process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| inputDocRef | DocumentReference | The input DocumentReference |
| organization | OrganizationModel | The organization associated with the document |
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient |
| docRefId | string | The ID for the new DocumentReference |
| s3Key | string | The S3 key for the document |
| s3BucketName | string | The S3 bucket name |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DocumentReference | DocumentReference | The composed DocumentReference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls helper functions to get various components of the DocumentReference.
2. Constructs and returns a new DocumentReference with the provided and generated data.

### Helper Functions
Several helper functions are defined to construct parts of the DocumentReference:

- `getMasterIdentifier`: Creates the master identifier for the DocumentReference.
- `getIdentifiers`: Combines existing identifiers with the master identifier.
- `getContained`: Creates the contained resources, including the organization.
- `getExtensions`: Manages the extensions, including the temporary extension.
- `isAllowedExtension`: Checks if an extension is allowed to be included.
- `getContent`: Creates the content section with a placeholder attachment.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides FHIR type definitions |
| @metriport/core/external/aws/s3 | S3 utilities for file operations |
| @metriport/core/external/fhir/patient/index | Patient-related FHIR utilities |
| @metriport/core/external/fhir/shared/namespaces | FHIR namespace constants |
| @metriport/core/util/error/bad-request | Custom error for bad requests |
| @metriport/core/external/fhir/shared/extensions/metriport | Metriport-specific FHIR extensions |
| lodash | Utility functions (cloneDeep) |
| ../../../models/medical/organization | Organization model |
| ../../../shared/config | Configuration utilities |
| ../../../shared/constants | Constant values |
| ../organization | Organization-related FHIR utilities |

## Configuration
The code uses configuration values for AWS region and S3 bucket names, which are retrieved from the Config object.

## Error Handling
The code uses BadRequestError for validation errors in the `docRefCheck` function.

This code is part of a larger system for handling medical documents and FHIR resources, specifically focusing on creating temporary DocumentReferences during the upload process.
