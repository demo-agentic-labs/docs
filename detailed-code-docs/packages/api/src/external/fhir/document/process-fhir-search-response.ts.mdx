## High-level description
This code defines a function `processFhirResponse` that handles the result of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) operation. It checks if the operation was successful and throws a `MetriportError` if it failed, providing detailed information about the error.

## Symbols

### `processFhirResponse`
#### Description
This function processes the result of a FHIR operation, specifically checking if the operation was successful or rejected. If rejected, it throws a `MetriportError` with detailed information about the failure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Pick&lt;Patient, "id"&gt; | An object containing the patient's ID |
| docId | string | The document ID associated with the FHIR operation |
| fhir | PromiseSettledResult&lt;void&gt; | The result of the FHIR operation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | void | The function doesn't return a value, but may throw an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function checks the `status` property of the `fhir` input.
2. If the status is "rejected", it throws a `MetriportError` with the message "Error upserting to FHIR".
3. The error includes additional information: the patient ID, document ID, and the reason for the failure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | Imports the `MetriportError` class for error handling |
| @metriport/core/domain/patient | Imports the `Patient` type for type checking |

## Error Handling
The function implements error handling by throwing a `MetriportError` when the FHIR operation fails. This error includes detailed information about the failure, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.

## References
The code references the `MetriportError` class, which is defined in a separate file (`packages/core/src/util/error/metriport-error.ts`). This class extends the standard `Error` class and includes additional properties such as `status` and `additionalInfo`.

Note: The `MetriportError` class is marked as deprecated in the related code snippet, with a comment suggesting to use `@metriport/shared` instead. This might indicate that there's a newer version of the error handling mechanism available in a different package.
