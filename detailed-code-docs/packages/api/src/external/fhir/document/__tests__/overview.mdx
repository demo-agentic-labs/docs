## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the FHIR document conversion module, specifically focusing on the conversion of CommonWell (CW) resources to FHIR-compliant resources. The tests cover various aspects of the conversion process, including author extraction, resource conversion, and date handling.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory ensure that the FHIR document conversion module correctly handles different scenarios when converting CommonWell documents to FHIR format. They verify:

1. The extraction of author information from CommonWell document content and matching with contained resources.
2. The conversion of CommonWell resources (like Practitioner and Patient) to FHIR-compliant resources.
3. The handling of organization references in Practitioner resources.
4. The correct setting of patient IDs during conversion.
5. The extraction of the most appropriate date from CommonWell document references.
6. The proper handling of document format information during conversion.

These tests help maintain the integrity and reliability of the FHIR conversion process, ensuring that the converted documents adhere to FHIR standards and correctly represent the original CommonWell data.

## Key Files

1. `cw-payloads.ts`:
   - Contains test data and payloads for CommonWell Health Alliance (CW) document references.
   - Defines sample document references with various author configurations and a contained patient with an organization reference.
   - Used across other test files to provide consistent test data.

2. `index-convert-to-fhir-resource.test.ts`:
   - Tests the `convertToFHIRResource` function.
   - Focuses on verifying the correct conversion of Practitioner and Patient resources.
   - Checks handling of organization references and patient IDs.

3. `index-get-authors.test.ts`:
   - Tests the `getAuthors` function.
   - Verifies extraction of author references from CommonWell document content.
   - Checks matching of author references with contained resources.
   - Ensures creation of FHIR-compliant author references.

4. `index-to-fhir.test.ts`:
   - Tests the `cwToFHIR` and `getBestDateFromCWDocRef` functions.
   - Verifies correct handling of document format during conversion.
   - Checks extraction of the best date from CommonWell document references.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @faker-js/faker: Used for generating random test data.
2. @metriport/commonwell-sdk: Provides types and utilities for working with CommonWell data.
3. uuid: Used for generating unique identifiers in test data.
4. dayjs: Utilized for date manipulation and comparison in tests.
5. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides FHIR type definitions.

Internal dependencies include various utility functions and types from the main codebase, such as `makePatient`, `makePeriod`, and `CWDocumentWithMetriportData`.

## Configuration
The tests use Jest as the testing framework. While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the tests likely rely on Jest configuration set at the project level.

Here's an example of how the `getAuthors` function is tested in `index-get-authors.test.ts`:

```typescript
describe("getAuthors", () =&gt; {
  it("returns multiple authors when multiple contained", () =&gt; {
    const contained = [
      { resourceType: "Practitioner", id: "authRef1" },
      { resourceType: "Practitioner", id: "authRef2" },
    ];
    const content = {
      author: [{ reference: "#authRef1" }, { reference: "#authRef2" }],
    };
    const docId = "doc123";

    const result = getAuthors(content as DocumentContent, contained, docId);

    expect(result).toHaveLength(2);
    expect(result[0]).toEqual({ reference: "Practitioner/authRef1" });
    expect(result[1]).toEqual({ reference: "Practitioner/authRef2" });
  });

  // ... more test cases ...
});
```

This test case verifies that the `getAuthors` function correctly handles multiple authors and contained resources, returning the expected FHIR-compliant author references.

The tests in this directory play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the FHIR document conversion process, which is essential for maintaining interoperability in healthcare data exchange.
