## High-level description
This file contains test data and payloads for CommonWell Health Alliance (CW) document references. It defines sample document references with various author configurations and a contained patient with an organization reference, which are used for testing purposes in the FHIR document conversion and processing functions.

## Symbols

### `docRefsWithOneAuthorPointingToMultipleContained`
#### Description
An array of two `Document` objects representing document references with different author configurations. These are used to test scenarios where a single author reference points to multiple contained resources.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| docRefsWithOneAuthorPointingToMultipleContained | Document[] | An array of two document references with specific author configurations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates two `Document` objects, each with a unique UUID and specific content:
   - The first document has two `Practitioner` resources with the same reference ID.
   - The second document has one `Organization` and one `Practitioner` resource with the same reference ID.
2. Both documents include various fields such as identifiers, subject, type, author, status, and context.
3. Uses `faker` to generate random data for names, dates, and URLs.

### `docRefContainedPatientWithOrg`
#### Description
A `Contained` object representing a practitioner with an organization reference. This is used to test scenarios involving practitioners associated with organizations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| docRefContainedPatientWithOrg | Contained | A practitioner object with an organization reference |

#### Internal Logic
Creates a `Practitioner` resource with:
- A specific ID (`authRef16`)
- A name using a randomly generated company name
- An organization reference (`#orgRef16`)
