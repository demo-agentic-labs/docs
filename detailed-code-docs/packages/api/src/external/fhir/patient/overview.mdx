## High-level description
This directory contains functionality for interacting with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) patient data. It provides capabilities for counting resources associated with patients or customers, and for upserting (updating or inserting) patient records in a FHIR server.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs two main functions:

1. Resource Counting: It allows counting of FHIR resources (such as medical records, observations, or other health-related data) associated with either a specific patient or all patients of a customer. This counting can be filtered by resource types and date range, providing flexibility in data analysis and reporting.

2. Patient Record Upsert: It provides functionality to update existing patient records or insert new ones in a FHIR server. This ensures that patient information in the FHIR system is kept up-to-date.

These functions are crucial for managing and analyzing patient data in healthcare information systems that use the FHIR standard.

## Key Files

### count-resources.ts
This file contains the core functionality for counting FHIR resources. It includes the following key functions:

- `countResources`: The main function that orchestrates the counting process. It determines whether to count by patient or customer and processes the results.
- `getResourceCountByPatient`: Counts resources for a specific patient.
- `getResourceCountByCustomer`: Counts resources for all patients of a customer.

These functions use the FHIR API to search for and count resources, with options to filter by resource types and date range.

### upsert-patient.ts
This file contains the `upsertPatientToFHIRServer` function, which is responsible for updating or inserting patient records in the FHIR server. It uses a FHIR API client to perform the operation.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @metriport/api-sdk: Provides the `ResourceTypeForConsolidation` type.
2. @metriport/core: Used for domain-specific types and utility functions.
3. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides FHIR-related type definitions, including the `Patient` type.

Internal dependencies include modules for creating FHIR API instances, handling notifications, and logging.

## Configuration
The code doesn't explicitly use configuration files, but it does rely on customer IDs (`cxId`) to create FHIR API instances. This suggests a multi-tenant architecture where different customers might have different FHIR server configurations.

## Error Handling and Logging
The resource counting functionality uses `Promise.allSettled` to handle potential errors when counting resources. Failed counts are logged and reported using a `capture.message` function.

Logging is done using a custom logging utility (`Util.out`) to log information about the counting process, including the total number of resources counted and any failures encountered.

The patient upsert function doesn't include explicit error handling, relying on error propagation to the caller.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `countResources` function might be used:

```typescript
const patient = { id: "123", cxId: "customer1" };
const resources = ["Observation", "Condition"];
const dateFrom = "2023-01-01";
const dateTo = "2023-12-31";

const resourceCount = await countResources(patient, resources, dateFrom, dateTo);
console.log(`Total resources: ${resourceCount.total}`);
```

And an example of using the `upsertPatientToFHIRServer` function:

```typescript
const cxId = "customer1";
const patient = {
  resourceType: "Patient",
  id: "123",
  name: [{ given: ["John"], family: "Doe" }],
  // ... other patient properties
};

await upsertPatientToFHIRServer(cxId, patient);
```

These functions provide a high-level interface for interacting with FHIR patient data, abstracting away the complexities of direct FHIR API interactions and providing useful utilities for data analysis and management in healthcare applications.
