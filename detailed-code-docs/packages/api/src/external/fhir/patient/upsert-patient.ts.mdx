## High-level description
This code defines a function `upsertPatientToFHIRServer` that updates or inserts a patient record in a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) server. It utilizes a FHIR API client to perform the operation.

## Symbols

### `upsertPatientToFHIRServer`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is responsible for updating or inserting a patient record in a FHIR server. It uses a FHIR API client created for a specific customer (identified by `cxId`) to perform the operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | Customer ID used to create the FHIR API client |
| patient | Patient | Patient object conforming to the FHIR Patient resource type |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | The function returns a Promise that resolves when the operation is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function calls `makeFhirApi(cxId)` to create a FHIR API client for the specified customer.
2. It then calls the `updateResource` method on the API client, passing the `patient` object as an argument.
3. The function is marked as `async`, so it returns a Promise that resolves when the `updateResource` operation is complete.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides the `Patient` type definition |
| ../api/api-factory | Provides the `makeFhirApi` function to create a FHIR API client |

## References
- The `makeFhirApi` function is imported from a relative path `../api/api-factory`, suggesting that there's a separate module responsible for creating FHIR API clients.
- The `Patient` type is imported from `@medplum/fhirtypes`, which is likely an external package providing FHIR-related type definitions.

## Notes
1. The function name "upsert" suggests that it can both update an existing patient record or insert a new one if it doesn't exist. However, the implementation only calls `updateResource`, which might not handle the insert case if the patient doesn't exist. This could be a potential issue or might rely on the FHIR server's implementation of `updateResource`.
2. There's no error handling in this function. Any errors thrown by `makeFhirApi` or `updateResource` will be propagated to the caller.
3. The function doesn't return any information about the updated/inserted patient. If such information is needed, the implementation might need to be modified.
4. The `cxId` parameter suggests that this function is designed to work in a multi-tenant environment, where different customers might have different FHIR server configurations.
