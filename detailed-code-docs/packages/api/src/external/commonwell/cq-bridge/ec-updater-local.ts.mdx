## High-level description
This code defines a class `ECUpdaterLocal` that extends `ECUpdater`. It provides methods to store and update coverage enhancement data for patients in a local database. The class implements two main methods: `storeECAfterIncludeList` and `storeECAfterDocQuery`, which handle different aspects of the coverage enhancement process.

## Code Structure
The `ECUpdaterLocal` class extends the `ECUpdater` abstract class and implements its abstract methods. It uses various utility functions and models to interact with the database and handle errors.

## Symbols

### `ECUpdaterLocal`
#### Description
This class provides methods to store and update coverage enhancement data for patients in a local database.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `executeAsynchronously` function to process multiple patients in parallel and the `executeOnDBTx` function to perform database transactions.

### `storeECAfterIncludeList`
#### Description
This method stores coverage enhancement data after processing an include list for multiple patients.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ecId | string | The coverage enhancement ID |
| cxId | string | The customer ID |
| patientIds | string[] | An array of patient IDs |
| cqOrgIds | string[] | An array of CQ organization IDs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates over patient IDs asynchronously
2. For each patient, it finds existing coverage enhancement data
3. Checks for CxId mismatch and throws an error if found
4. Updates the CQ organization list
5. Creates or updates coverage enhancements for the patient

### `storeECAfterDocQuery`
#### Description
This method stores coverage enhancement data after performing a document query for a single patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ecId | string | The coverage enhancement ID |
| cxId | string | The customer ID |
| patientId | string | The patient ID |
| docsFound | number | The number of documents found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds existing coverage enhancement data for the patient
2. Throws a NotFoundError if no existing data is found
3. Checks for CxId mismatch and throws an error if found
4. Updates the coverage enhancement data with the number of documents found

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/external/commonwell/cq-bridge/ec-updater | Imports the base ECUpdater class |
| @metriport/core/util/concurrency | Provides the executeAsynchronously function |
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | Provides the MetriportError class |
| @metriport/core/util/error/not-found | Provides the NotFoundError class |
| ../../../models/medical/coverage-enhancement | Imports the CoverageEnhancementModel |
| ../../../models/transaction-wrapper | Provides the executeOnDBTx function |
| ./coverage-enhancement-storage | Provides the createOrUpdateCoverageEnhancements function |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling by throwing specific error types:
- `MetriportError` for CxId mismatches
- `NotFoundError` when a coverage enhancement is not found

These errors include additional context information to aid in debugging and error resolution.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
