## High-level description
This code implements a function to complete enhanced coverage (EC) for patients in a CommonWell Health Alliance integration. It updates the CareQuality (CQ) link status for multiple patients, triggers document queries, and stores the results of these queries.

## Code Structure
The main function `completeEnhancedCoverage` orchestrates the process, using `setCQLinkStatus` to update patient statuses and `finishEnhancedCoverage` to perform document queries. It utilizes `executeAsynchronously` for parallel processing of patient updates.

## Symbols

### `completeEnhancedCoverage`
#### Description
This asynchronous function completes the enhanced coverage process for a list of patients by updating their CQ link status and triggering document queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ecId | string \| undefined | Enhanced coverage ID |
| cxId | string | Customer ID |
| patientIds | string[] | Array of patient IDs |
| cqLinkStatus | CQLinkStatus | CareQuality link status to set |

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the start of the process.
2. Defines an async function `completeECForPatient` to process each patient.
3. Uses `executeAsynchronously` to process patients in parallel.
4. For each patient, it updates the CQ link status and, if linked, finishes the enhanced coverage.

### `finishEnhancedCoverage`
#### Description
This function completes the enhanced coverage process for a single patient by triggering and querying document references.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| ecId | string \| undefined | Enhanced coverage ID |
| patient | Patient | Patient object |
| log | Function | Logging function (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the patient has a facility ID.
2. Triggers and queries document references for the patient.
3. If an ecId is provided, stores the EC results after the document query.
4. Logs the duration of the process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/util/concurrency | For executing asynchronous operations |
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | For custom error handling |
| @metriport/core/util/log | For logging |
| dayjs | For date and time operations |
| TriggerAndQueryDocRefsLocal | For triggering and querying document references |
| Patient | Patient domain model |
| CQLinkStatus | Enum for CQ link status |
| setCQLinkStatus | Function to set CQ link status |
| ECUpdaterLocal | Class for updating enhanced coverage |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| PARALLEL_UPDATES | number | 25 | Number of parallel patient updates |
| triggerWHNotificationsToCx | boolean | true | Whether to trigger webhook notifications to the customer |

## Error Handling
The code uses `MetriportError` for custom error handling, particularly when a patient has no facility ID.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses parallel processing (`executeAsynchronously`) to handle multiple patient updates efficiently. It also logs the duration of the document query process for each patient.
