## High-level description
This code implements a function to check for patients with stale enhanced coverage in the CommonWell Health Alliance system. It identifies patients whose enhanced coverage processing has exceeded a maximum duration, notifies about these cases, and forces the completion of their enhanced coverage.

## Code Structure
The main function `checkStaleEnhancedCoverage` uses helper functions `getPatientsWithStaleEC` and `notifyStaleEC`. It also imports and uses the `completeEnhancedCoverage` function from another module.

## Symbols

### `checkStaleEnhancedCoverage`
#### Description
This function checks for patients with stale enhanced coverage and completes their processing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxIds | string[] | Array of customer IDs to check for stale enhanced coverage |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | This function doesn't return a value, but performs operations asynchronously |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves patients with stale enhanced coverage using `getPatientsWithStaleEC`.
2. Notifies about stale enhanced coverage cases using `notifyStaleEC`.
3. Groups patients by customer ID.
4. Iterates through grouped patients and calls `completeEnhancedCoverage` for each group.

### `getPatientsWithStaleEC`
#### Description
Retrieves patients whose enhanced coverage processing has exceeded the maximum duration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxIds | string[] | Array of customer IDs to filter patients |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;SimplifiedPatient[]&gt; | Array of patients with stale enhanced coverage |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates the earliest date for stale enhanced coverage.
2. Queries the database for patients with specific conditions:
   - Matching customer IDs (if provided)
   - CQ link status is "processing"
   - Created before the earliest date

### `notifyStaleEC`
#### Description
Logs and captures a message about patients with stale enhanced coverage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patients | SimplifiedPatient[] | Array of patients with stale enhanced coverage |

#### Internal Logic
1. Groups patients by customer ID.
2. Logs a message with the count of affected patients.
3. Captures a warning message with patient details.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation |
| lodash | Utility functions (groupBy) |
| sequelize | Database ORM |
| @metriport/core | Core domain models and utilities |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MAX_EC_DURATON | dayjs.Duration | 40 minutes | Maximum duration for enhanced coverage processing |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic Promise rejection. Errors would propagate to the caller.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` for logging messages about stale enhanced coverage cases.

## Side Effects
The code interacts with the database to retrieve and update patient records. It also sends notifications using the `capture.message` function.
