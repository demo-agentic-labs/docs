## High-level description
This code defines a function `getPatientsToEnhanceCoverage` that retrieves a list of patients from a database to enhance their coverage through linking with CareQuality Organizations. It filters patients based on specific criteria, including their creation time and current CareQuality link status.

## Code Structure
The main function `getPatientsToEnhanceCoverage` uses the `PatientModel` to query the database and return a list of patients meeting the specified criteria. It utilizes the `dayjs` library for date manipulation and the `sequelize` ORM for database operations.

## Symbols

### `getPatientsToEnhanceCoverage`
#### Description
This function retrieves patients from the database that are eligible for coverage enhancement through CareQuality linking.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxIds | string[] | An array of customer IDs to filter patients |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| PatientToLink[] | Array of objects | An array of patient objects containing `cxId` and `id` |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate the earliest date for patient creation using `dayjs`.
2. Define CareQuality link statuses that should be excluded.
3. Query the database using `PatientModel.findAll()` with specific criteria:
   - Filter by `cxIds` if provided.
   - Check `externalData.COMMONWELL.cqLinkStatus` in the `data` field.
   - Ensure `createdAt` is before or equal to the calculated earliest date.
4. Map the query results to return only the required fields (`cxId` and `id`).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dayjs | Date manipulation and calculation |
| sequelize | Database ORM for querying patients |
| @metriport/core | Provides types and constants (indirectly referenced) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MIN_TIME_AFTER_PATIENT_CREATED | dayjs.Duration | 2 minutes | Minimum time after patient creation before processing |

## Performance Considerations
The function uses database querying, which could be a performance bottleneck for large datasets. The query is optimized by selecting only the required attributes (`id` and `cxId`) and using appropriate indexing on the `cxId`, `data`, and `createdAt` fields would be beneficial.
