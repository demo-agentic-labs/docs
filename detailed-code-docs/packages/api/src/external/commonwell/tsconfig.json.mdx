title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) specifically for the CommonWell external integration within the API package. It extends the base TypeScript configuration and adds additional compiler options and file inclusion/exclusion rules for the CommonWell-related code.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with four main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, `include`, and `exclude`.

## Symbols

### `extends`
#### Description
Specifies the base configuration file that this configuration extends from.

#### Value
`"../../../tsconfig.json"`

This indicates that the current configuration extends the `tsconfig.json` file located three directories up from the current file's location, which is likely the root TypeScript configuration for the entire project.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
Specifies additional compiler options for the TypeScript compiler when processing files in this directory.

#### Internal Logic
Currently, it only sets one option:
- `"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true`: This enables stricter checking for indexed access, helping to prevent errors related to potentially undefined values when accessing properties or elements using an index.

### `include`
#### Description
Specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Value
`["./**/*"]`

This pattern includes all files in the current directory and all subdirectories.

### `exclude`
#### Description
Specifies which files should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Value
`["./**/*.test.ts"]`

This pattern excludes all files with the `.test.ts` extension in the current directory and all subdirectories, effectively omitting test files from the compilation.

## Dependencies
This configuration file indirectly depends on the root `tsconfig.json` file that it extends.

## Configuration
The main configuration options set in this file are:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| noUncheckedIndexedAccess | boolean | true | Enables stricter checking for indexed access |

Note that other configuration options are likely inherited from the extended `tsconfig.json` file.

This configuration file is crucial for ensuring that the TypeScript compiler processes the CommonWell-related code with the appropriate settings, maintaining consistency with the overall project configuration while adding specific rules for this module. It helps in maintaining code quality by enforcing stricter type checking and excluding test files from the main compilation process.
