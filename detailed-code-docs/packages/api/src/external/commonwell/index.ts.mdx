## High-level description
This code defines a module that exports a set of commands for interacting with CommonWell Health Alliance services. It includes operations for managing organizations, patients, and links within the CommonWell ecosystem.

## Code Structure
The code imports functionality from various modules and combines them into a single object `cwCommands`. This object is then exported as the default export of the module.

## Symbols

### cwCommands
#### Description
An object that contains various commands for interacting with CommonWell Health Alliance services. It is organized into three main categories: organization, patient, and link.

#### Internal Logic
The `cwCommands` object is structured as follows:
- `organization`: Contains a single command for creating or updating CommonWell organizations.
- `patient`: Contains commands for creating, retrieving, updating, and removing patients, as well as getting link statuses.
- `link`: Contains commands for creating, retrieving, resetting, and finding links.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./link | Provides link-related functionality |
| ./command/create-or-update-cw-organization | Provides organization-related functionality |
| ./patient | Provides patient-related functionality |

Note: The exact functionality of these imported modules is not visible in the provided code snippet, but they are used to populate the `cwCommands` object.

This module serves as a central point for accessing various CommonWell-related operations, making it easier for other parts of the application to interact with CommonWell services in a structured manner.
