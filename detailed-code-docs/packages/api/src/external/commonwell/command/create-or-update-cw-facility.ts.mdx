## High-level description
This code defines a function `createOrUpdateFacilityInCw` that creates or updates a facility in CommonWell Health Alliance (CW). It takes facility information and organization details as input, constructs the necessary data, and calls the `createOrUpdateCWOrganization` function to perform the actual creation or update operation in CommonWell.

## Symbols

### `createOrUpdateFacilityInCw`
#### Description
This function is responsible for creating or updating a facility in CommonWell. It prepares the organization data based on the input parameters and calls the `createOrUpdateCWOrganization` function to perform the operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The customer ID |
| facility | Facility | The facility object containing details of the facility |
| cxOrgName | string | The name of the customer organization |
| cxOrgType | OrgType | The type of the customer organization |
| cwOboOid | string \| undefined | The CommonWell On Behalf Of (OBO) Organization ID |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the organization name using `buildCwOrgNameForFacility` function.
2. Calls `createOrUpdateCWOrganization` with the prepared data, including:
   - Customer ID
   - Organization details (OID, name, type, location)
   - Active status
   - Whether it's an OBO (On Behalf Of) organization

#### Side Effects
This function indirectly modifies the CommonWell system by creating or updating an organization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/organization | Imports the OrgType enum |
| ../../../domain/medical/facility | Imports Facility type and isOboFacility function |
| ./create-or-update-cw-organization | Imports createOrUpdateCWOrganization function |
| ../shared | Imports buildCwOrgNameForFacility function |

## References
This code is referenced and used in:
1. `packages/api/src/routes/medical/internal-facility.ts`: In the PUT /internal/facility route handler, where it's called to sync facility data with CommonWell when certain conditions are met.
2. `packages/api/src/external/commonwell/__tests__/cw.register-facility.test.ts`: In unit tests that verify the correct behavior of the `createOrUpdateFacilityInCw` function.

## Notes
- The function handles both regular facilities and OBO (On Behalf Of) facilities, determining the appropriate organization name and OBO status based on the input.
- Error handling is not explicitly implemented within this function, suggesting that errors are expected to be handled by the caller.
