## High-level description
This code provides functionality for managing patient links and network links in the CommonWell Health Alliance system. It includes methods for creating, upgrading, and managing patient-person associations, as well as handling network links between patients across different organizations.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are:

1. `commonwellPersonLinks`: A function that filters and flattens an array of Person objects.
2. `PatientWithCW`: A type that extends the Patient type with CommonWell-specific data.
3. `patientWithCWData`: A function that creates a PatientWithCW object from a Patient and CommonWell data.
4. `isInsideOrgExcludeList`: A function that checks if a network link is associated with an excluded organization.
5. `autoUpgradeNetworkLinks`: A function that automatically upgrades LOLA 1 network links to LOLA 2 for a given patient.

These symbols are interconnected, with `autoUpgradeNetworkLinks` being the main function that utilizes the others to perform its task.

## Symbols

### `commonwellPersonLinks`
#### Description
This function takes an array of Person objects and returns a flattened array of non-null Person objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| persons | Person[] | An array of Person objects |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Person[] | A flattened array of non-null Person objects |

### `PatientWithCW`
#### Description
This type extends the Patient type by replacing the `externalData` field with a more specific structure that includes CommonWell data.

### `patientWithCWData`
#### Description
This function creates a PatientWithCW object by combining a Patient object with CommonWell-specific data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The original Patient object |
| cwEntry | PatientExternalDataEntry | The CommonWell-specific data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | PatientWithCW | A PatientWithCW object combining the input data |

### `isInsideOrgExcludeList`
#### Description
This function checks if a network link is associated with an organization in the exclude list.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| link | NetworkLink | The network link to check |
| orgIdExcludeList | string[] | List of organization IDs to exclude |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | boolean | True if the link is associated with an excluded organization, false otherwise |

### `autoUpgradeNetworkLinks`
#### Description
This function automatically upgrades LOLA 1 network links to LOLA 2 for a given patient, while also handling downgrades for links associated with excluded organizations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commonWell | CommonWellAPI | The CommonWell API object |
| queryMeta | RequestMetadata | Metadata for the API request |
| commonwellPatientId | string | The patient ID in the CommonWell system |
| commonwellPersonId | string | The CommonWell Person ID of the patient |
| executionContext | string | The execution context of the current request |
| getOrgIdExcludeList | () =&gt; Promise&lt;string[]&gt; | Function to get the list of organization IDs to exclude |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;NetworkLink[] \| undefined&gt; | An array of updated NetworkLink objects, or undefined if no links were found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetch network links and the organization exclude list.
2. Separate links into LOLA 1 and LOLA 2/3 categories.
3. Downgrade LOLA 2/3 links associated with excluded organizations.
4. Upgrade eligible LOLA 1 links to LOLA 2.
5. Return the updated list of network links.

## Side Effects
The `autoUpgradeNetworkLinks` function modifies network links in the CommonWell system, potentially changing their LOLA levels.
