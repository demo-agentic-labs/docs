## High-level description
This directory contains modules for managing patient links in the CommonWell Health Alliance system. It provides functionality for creating, retrieving, resetting, and upgrading patient links, as well as handling network links between patients across different organizations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates the integration of patient data with the CommonWell Health Alliance system. It allows healthcare providers to:

1. Create new patient links in CommonWell, associating local patient records with CommonWell person records.
2. Retrieve current and potential links for a patient, helping to identify possible matches across different healthcare organizations.
3. Reset existing patient links, removing associations between local patient records and CommonWell person records.
4. Automatically upgrade network links between patients, improving the level of assurance (LOLA) for patient matches.
5. Manage CommonWell-specific patient data, including IDs and statuses.

These operations are crucial for maintaining accurate patient identity across different healthcare providers and ensuring that patient information can be securely shared when necessary.

## Key Files

### create.ts
This file contains the `create` function, which is responsible for creating new patient links in the CommonWell system. It performs the following tasks:
- Checks if CommonWell is enabled for the customer
- Retrieves patient data
- Creates a link in CommonWell
- Updates the patient's CommonWell IDs and status in the local system
- Automatically upgrades network links

### get.ts
This file provides functions for retrieving patient link information:
- `get`: Retrieves current and potential links for a patient
- `findCurrentLink`: Finds the current link for a patient in CommonWell
- `findAllPotentialLinks`: Searches for potential patient matches in CommonWell

### reset.ts
The `reset` function in this file handles the process of removing existing links between a patient and a person in CommonWell. It also updates the patient's data in the local system to reflect the reset.

### shared.ts
This file contains shared utilities and types used across the other modules:
- `commonwellPersonLinks`: Filters and flattens an array of Person objects
- `patientWithCWData`: Creates a PatientWithCW object combining local and CommonWell data
- `autoUpgradeNetworkLinks`: Automatically upgrades LOLA 1 network links to LOLA 2

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @metriport/commonwell-sdk: Provides the CommonWell API functionality
2. @metriport/core: Offers utility functions and domain-specific operations
3. lodash: Used for various utility functions

Internal dependencies include modules for patient data retrieval, CommonWell API initialization, and patient data updates.

## Configuration
The functionality in this directory is dependent on feature flags and configurations, particularly for determining if CommonWell is enabled for a specific customer. These configurations are typically retrieved from external sources or environment variables.

## Error Handling
The code implements comprehensive error handling throughout its functions. Errors are caught, logged, and often re-thrown with additional context information. A custom `CommonwellError` is used to provide more specific error details related to CommonWell operations.

Here's an example of error handling from the `reset` function in `reset.ts`:

```typescript
try {
  // ... function logic ...
} catch (error) {
  const msg = `Failed to reset CW link for patient ${patientId}`;
  out.error(msg, error);
  capture.error(error, {
    extra: {
      context: executionContext,
      patientId,
      cxId,
      facilityId,
    },
  });
  throw new CommonwellError(msg, { cause: error });
}
```

This approach ensures that errors are properly logged and captured for monitoring, while also providing meaningful error messages to the calling code.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing patient links in the CommonWell Health Alliance system, enabling healthcare providers to efficiently share and manage patient information across organizations while maintaining data integrity and patient privacy.
