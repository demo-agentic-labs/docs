## High-level description
This code defines an internal API endpoint for managing patient data in a healthcare system. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving patient information, as well as managing patient links across different Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) and enhancing patient coverage.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as an Express router with various endpoints for different patient-related operations. It imports functions from other modules to handle specific tasks such as patient retrieval, updating, and interaction with external systems like CommonWell and Carequality.

## Symbols

### `patchDuplicatedPersonsForPatient`
#### Description
This function patches duplicated persons in CommonWell for a given patient. It links the patient to a chosen person and unenrolls other persons if necessary.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | Customer ID |
| patientId | string | Patient ID |
| chosenPersonId | string | ID of the chosen person to link |
| unenrollByDemographics | boolean | Flag to unenroll other persons by demographics |
| orgIdExcludeList | () =&gt; Promise&lt;string[]&gt; | Function to get organization IDs to exclude |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the patient and CommonWell access information
2. Checks if the chosen person exists in CommonWell
3. Unlinks and unenrolls the currently linked person if different from the chosen person
4. Links the chosen person to the patient
5. Upgrades network links with the chosen person's patients
6. Updates Metriport's database with new CommonWell IDs and status
7. Optionally unenrolls other persons by demographics

### `getCWAccessForPatient`
#### Description
This function retrieves CommonWell access information for a given patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| CWAccess | object | CommonWell access information or error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the facility ID for the patient
2. Gets CommonWell data from the patient's external data
3. Retrieves the CommonWell initiator information
4. Creates a CommonWell API instance
5. Generates query metadata for CommonWell

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/commonwell-sdk | Interacting with CommonWell API |
| @metriport/core | Utility functions and domain models |
| express-promise-router | Creating Express router |
| zod | Request validation |

## Error Handling
The code uses try-catch blocks to handle errors in asynchronous operations. It also uses the `capture.error` function to log errors with additional context.
