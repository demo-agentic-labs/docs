## High-level description
This code exports a default function that initializes CommonWell events, specifically for the CQ Bridge patient event listener. It serves as an entry point for setting up event handling related to CommonWell integration within the API.

### Default Export Function
#### Description
The default export is an unnamed function that serves as the main entry point for initializing CommonWell events. It calls the `initCQBridgeEvents` function to set up the patient event listener for the CQ Bridge.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value (implicitly returns `undefined`).

#### Internal Logic
The function's sole purpose is to call `initCQBridgeEvents()`, which is responsible for initializing the CQ Bridge patient event listener.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `./cq-bridge/patient-event-listener` | Imports the `initCQBridgeEvents` function for initializing the CQ Bridge patient event listener |

## References
The code references the `initCQBridgeEvents` function, which is imported from the `./cq-bridge/patient-event-listener` module. This function is likely responsible for setting up event listeners related to patient data in the context of the CommonWell Health Alliance integration, specifically for the CQ Bridge component.

## Side Effects
While not explicitly visible in this file, calling `initCQBridgeEvents()` likely sets up event listeners or other mechanisms that may have side effects on the application's behavior, particularly in handling patient-related events within the CommonWell integration.
