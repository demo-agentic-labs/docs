## High-level description
This code implements functionality for querying and processing documents from CommonWell Health Alliance (CW) for a given patient. It handles patient discovery, document retrieval, and conversion of documents to FHIR format. The code also manages the integration status of patients with CommonWell and handles various error scenarios.

## Code Structure
The main function `queryAndProcessDocuments` orchestrates the document query and processing workflow. It uses several helper functions and external services to perform tasks such as patient discovery, document downloading, and FHIR conversion. The code interacts with a database to store and retrieve patient information, and it uses external APIs for CommonWell integration.

## Symbols

### `queryAndProcessDocuments`
#### Description
This function queries CommonWell for DocumentReferences, downloads and converts documents to FHIR, and stores the FHIR results on the FHIR server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient to query for |
| facilityId | string | The facility to query for (optional if the patient only has one facility) |
| forceDownload | boolean | Whether to force download the documents from CW, even if they are already on S3 (optional) |
| ignoreDocRefOnFHIRServer | boolean | Whether to ignore the doc refs on the FHIR server and re-query CW for them (optional) |
| requestId | string | The request ID for tracking purposes |
| getOrgIdExcludeList | function | A function that returns a promise resolving to a list of organization IDs to exclude |
| triggerConsolidated | boolean | Whether to trigger a consolidated query (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if CommonWell is enabled for the customer and facility
2. Sets up document query progress tracking
3. Retrieves patient data from CommonWell
4. Queries for documents
5. Downloads and processes documents
6. Converts documents to FHIR format
7. Stores results on the FHIR server
8. Handles error scenarios and updates query progress

### `internalGetDocuments`
#### Description
Queries for document references at CommonWell.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | PatientWithCWData | The patient with CommonWell data |
| initiator | HieInitiator | The initiator of the query |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| documents | Document[] | Array of document references in CommonWell format |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up CommonWell API client
2. Performs the document query
3. Processes the response, separating documents and errors
4. Reports any errors encountered during the query

### `downloadDocsAndUpsertFHIR`
#### Description
Downloads documents from CommonWell DocumentReferences, stores them on S3, and converts them to FHIR resources if they're CCDA.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient to query for |
| facilityId | string | The facility ID |
| documents | Document[] | The CommonWell document references to download and convert |
| forceDownload | boolean | Whether to force download the documents from CW |
| ignoreDocRefOnFHIRServer | boolean | Whether to ignore the doc refs on the FHIR server |
| requestId | string | The request ID for tracking purposes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| docsNewLocation | DocumentReference[] | Document References as they were stored on the FHIR server |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves existing DocumentReferences from the FHIR server
2. Determines which documents need to be downloaded
3. Downloads documents in chunks
4. Converts CCDA documents to FHIR format
5. Stores documents and FHIR resources on the FHIR server
6. Updates document query progress

- dayjs
- lodash

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling throughout the process. It catches errors, logs them, and in some cases, sends notifications to a monitoring system (e.g., Sentry). The error handling also includes updating the document query progress status to "failed" when errors occur.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging utility (`Util.out`) to log information throughout the process. It logs various steps of the document query and processing workflow, as well as any errors encountered.

## TODOs
- Move certain functionalities to core modules
- Implement more efficient database operations
- Improve error handling and reporting
- Optimize the document download and conversion process
