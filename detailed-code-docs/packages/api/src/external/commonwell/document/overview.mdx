## High-level description
This directory contains code for handling document-related operations within the CommonWell integration of the Metriport API. It includes functionality for querying, downloading, and processing medical documents, as well as a sandbox environment for testing and development.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key functions:

1. Document Querying: It queries CommonWell Health Alliance (CW) for document references related to a specific patient.

2. Document Downloading: It downloads the actual documents from CommonWell based on the retrieved document references.

3. Document Conversion: It converts CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format when necessary.

4. FHIR Server Integration: It stores the processed documents and their references on a FHIR server.

5. Sandbox Environment: It provides a simulated environment for testing document querying and processing without interacting with real patient data or external systems.

6. Progress Tracking: It manages and updates the progress of document queries and processing.

7. Error Handling: It implements error handling throughout the document processing workflow, logging errors and updating statuses accordingly.

## Entry points
The main entry point for document operations is the `queryAndProcessDocuments` function in the `document-query.ts` file. This function orchestrates the entire process of querying, downloading, and processing documents for a given patient.

For sandbox operations, the `sandboxGetDocRefsAndUpsert` function in `document-query-sandbox.ts` serves as the entry point, simulating the document querying and processing workflow.

The `makeDocumentDownloader` function in `document-downloader-factory.ts` is used to create the appropriate document downloader based on the environment (local or lambda-based).

## Key Files
1. `document-query.ts`: Contains the main logic for querying and processing documents from CommonWell.

2. `document-query-sandbox.ts`: Implements a sandbox environment for simulating document querying and processing.

3. `document-downloader-factory.ts`: Provides a factory function for creating document downloaders based on the environment.

4. `shared.ts`: Defines shared types and utility functions used across the document processing workflow.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

- @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides FHIR type definitions.
- @metriport/commonwell-sdk: Offers functionality for interacting with CommonWell Health Alliance services.
- @metriport/core: Provides core utilities and domain models.
- dayjs: Used for date and time manipulation.
- lodash: Utilized for various utility functions.
- uuid-v7: Generates UUIDs for unique identification.

## Configuration
The code uses configuration settings from a `Config` class, including:

- AWS_REGION: The AWS region for the application.
- MEDICAL_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET_NAME: The S3 bucket name for storing medical documents.
- DOCUMENT_DOWNLOADER_LAMBDA_NAME: The name of the Lambda function for document downloading.

Additionally, the code checks for CommonWell enablement for customers and facilities, suggesting that there are configuration options to enable or disable CommonWell integration on a per-customer or per-facility basis.

The sandbox environment uses a `sandboxSleepTime` constant (set to 5000ms) to simulate realistic delays in document processing.

In summary, this directory contains crucial functionality for handling medical documents within the Metriport API, providing both production and sandbox environments for document querying, downloading, and processing. It integrates with CommonWell Health Alliance services and manages the conversion and storage of documents in FHIR format.
