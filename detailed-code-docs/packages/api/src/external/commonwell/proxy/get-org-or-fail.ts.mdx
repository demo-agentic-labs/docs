## High-level description
This code defines a function `getOrgOrFail` that retrieves an organization from the database based on its OID (Organization Identifier). If the organization is not found, it throws a `NotFoundError`. This function is specifically designed for use in contexts where the customer ID (`cxId`) is not available.

## Symbols

### `getOrgOrFail`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves an organization from the database using its OID. If the organization is not found, it throws a `NotFoundError`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgOID | string | The Organization Identifier (OID) used to look up the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| org | Organization | The retrieved organization object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `OrganizationModel.findOne()` to query the database for an organization with the given OID.
2. If no organization is found (i.e., `org` is null or undefined), throws a `NotFoundError` with a descriptive message.
3. If an organization is found, returns the organization object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/domain/organization | Imports the `Organization` type |
| ../../../errors/not-found | Imports the `NotFoundError` class for error handling |
| ../../../models/medical/organization | Imports the `OrganizationModel` for database operations |

## Error Handling
The function throws a `NotFoundError` if the organization with the given OID is not found in the database. This error includes a descriptive message containing the OID that was not found.

## Notes
The code includes a comment explaining why a separate function was created instead of reusing an existing `getOrganizationOrFail` function. The reason is that this context doesn't have access to the customer ID (`cxId`), and the existing function requires `cxId` to prevent cross-tenant data access. This design choice helps maintain data isolation between different tenants or customers.
