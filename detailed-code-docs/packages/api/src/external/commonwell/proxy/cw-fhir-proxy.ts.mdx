## High-level description
This code defines a router for handling CommonWell (CW) Document Query (DQ) requests. It sets up endpoints to process these requests, specifically for the `/DocumentReference` path. The router also includes error handling for undefined routes and provides a dummy router when the FHIR server for CW is disabled.

## Code Structure
The main router (`fhirRouter`) is created using `express-promise-router`. It defines a GET route for `/DocumentReference` that processes the request using the `processRequest` function. A catch-all route is also defined to handle undefined paths. A `dummyRouter` is created to return a "Not Found" error when the FHIR server is disabled. The final `router` export is determined based on whether the `fhirServerUrl` is defined.

## Symbols

### `fhirRouter`
#### Description
An Express router that handles the `/DocumentReference` GET request and a catch-all route for undefined paths.

#### Internal Logic
- For the `/DocumentReference` GET route:
  1. Uses `requestLogger` middleware.
  2. Processes the request using `processRequest` function.
  3. Returns the resulting bundle with a 200 status code.
- For all other routes, it throws a `NotFoundError`.

### `dummyRouter`
#### Description
A router that returns a "Not Found" error for all routes when the FHIR server for CW is disabled.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `requestLogger` middleware.
- Throws a `NotFoundError` with the message "FHIR server for CW is disabled".

### `router`
#### Description
The main router exported by this module. It is either `fhirRouter` or `dummyRouter` depending on whether `fhirServerUrl` is defined.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/util/error/not-found | Provides the `NotFoundError` class for handling 404 errors |
| express-promise-router | Creates an Express router that allows the use of async route handlers |
| ../../../routes/util | Provides the `asyncHandler` function for wrapping async route handlers |
| ./cw-process-request | Provides the `processRequest` function for handling CW requests |
| ./shared | Provides the `fhirServerUrl` configuration |
| ../../../routes/helpers/request-logger | Provides the `requestLogger` middleware for logging requests |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling by:
1. Using `asyncHandler` to wrap route handlers, which catches and forwards any errors to Express's error handling middleware.
2. Throwing `NotFoundError` for undefined routes or when the FHIR server is disabled.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /DocumentReference | GET | Query parameters for Document Query | JSON bundle of DocumentReference resources | Processes a CW Document Query request |
| /* | ALL | Any | 404 Not Found | Handles undefined routes |

Note: The actual processing of the Document Query request is handled by the `processRequest` function, which is imported from `./cw-process-request`.
