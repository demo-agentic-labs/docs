## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `updateCommonwellIdsAndStatus` function, which is responsible for updating CommonWell (CW) IDs and integration status on a patient record. The tests cover various scenarios of updating CW external data on a patient, including cases where the data is empty, partially filled, or needs to be updated with new values.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into a single describe block for the `setCommonwellIdsAndStatus` function. It contains multiple test cases that check different scenarios of updating CommonWell data. The tests use Jest mocks to simulate database operations and verify the correct updates are made to the patient record.

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test case by mocking the database transaction and PatientModel methods.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `mockStartTransaction()` to mock the database transaction.
- Mocks `PatientModel.findOne` and `PatientModel.update` methods.

### `afterEach`
#### Description
Cleans up the test environment after each test case.

#### Internal Logic
- Restores all mocks to their original implementation.

### `checkPatientUpdateWith`
#### Description
A helper function to check if the `PatientModel.update` method was called with the expected CommonWell parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cwParams | Partial&lt;CWParams&gt; | The CommonWell parameters to check against |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Jest's `expect` to verify that `PatientModel.update` was called with an object containing the expected CommonWell data.

### `describe("setCommonwellIdsAndStatus")`
#### Description
A test suite for the `updateCommonwellIdsAndStatus` function.

#### Internal Logic
Contains multiple test cases that cover different scenarios of updating CommonWell data on a patient record.

### Test: "has CW externalData set to newValues when CW externalData is empty and we set newValues"
#### Description
Tests updating CommonWell data when the patient's external data is initially empty.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates a patient with no CommonWell data.
- Acts: Calls `updateCommonwellIdsAndStatus` with new CommonWell values.
- Asserts: Checks if the patient was updated with the new CommonWell values.

### Test: "has CW externalData set to newValues when CW externalData has oldValues and we set newValues"
#### Description
Tests updating CommonWell data when the patient already has existing CommonWell data.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates a patient with existing CommonWell data.
- Acts: Calls `updateCommonwellIdsAndStatus` with new CommonWell values.
- Asserts: Checks if the patient was updated with the new CommonWell values, overwriting the old ones.

### Test: "has CW externalData set to newStatus + oldValues when CW externalData has oldValues and we set newStatus"
#### Description
Tests updating only the CommonWell patient ID while keeping other existing values.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates a patient with existing CommonWell data.
- Acts: Calls `updateCommonwellIdsAndStatus` with only a new patient ID.
- Asserts: Checks if the patient was updated with the new patient ID while keeping other existing values.

### Test: "has CW externalData set to onlyPatientId & cqLinkStatus = unlinked when CW externalData is empty and we set onlyPatientId"
#### Description
Tests setting only the CommonWell patient ID when the patient has no existing CommonWell data.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates a patient with no CommonWell data.
- Acts: Calls `updateCommonwellIdsAndStatus` with only a new patient ID.
- Asserts: Checks if the patient was updated with the new patient ID and the cqLinkStatus set to "unlinked".

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following modules and functions:
- `updateCommonwellIdsAndStatus` from "../patient-external-data"
- `PatientModel` from "../../../models/medical/patient"
- `makePatient`, `makePatientData` from "../../../domain/medical/__tests__/patient"
- `mockStartTransaction` from "../../../models/__tests__/transaction"
- `PatientDataCommonwell` from "../patient-shared"

## Error Handling
The tests do not explicitly cover error handling scenarios. They focus on successful update cases.

## Performance Considerations
There are no specific performance considerations mentioned in these tests. The tests focus on functionality rather than performance.
