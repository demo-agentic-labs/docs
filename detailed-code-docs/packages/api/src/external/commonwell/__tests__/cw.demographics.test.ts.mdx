## High-level description
This file contains a test suite for the CommonWell (CW) demographics normalization functionality. It specifically tests the `patientNetworkLinkToNormalizedLinkDemographics` function, which transforms a `PatientNetworkLink` object into a normalized `LinkDemographics` object.

## Code Structure
The test file consists of a single `describe` block containing one test case (`it` block). The test case creates a sample `PatientNetworkLink` object and verifies that the normalization function correctly transforms and normalizes the demographic data.

## References
- `PatientNetworkLink` from "@metriport/commonwell-sdk"
- `patientNetworkLinkToNormalizedLinkDemographics` from "../patient-demographics"

## Symbols

### `describe("CW demographics", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for CW demographics normalization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a sample `PatientNetworkLink` object with various demographic details.
2. Contains a single test case for normalization.

### `it("normalization", ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies the correct normalization of a `PatientNetworkLink` object into a `LinkDemographics` object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `patientNetworkLinkToNormalizedLinkDemographics` with the sample `PatientNetworkLink`.
2. Uses `expect().toMatchObject()` to compare the result with an expected output.

#### Arrange
- Creates a sample `PatientNetworkLink` object with various demographic details.

#### Act
- Calls `patientNetworkLinkToNormalizedLinkDemographics(patientNetworkLink)`.

#### Assert
- Compares the result with an expected object structure using `expect().toMatchObject()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/commonwell-sdk | Provides the `PatientNetworkLink` type |
| ../patient-demographics | Provides the `patientNetworkLinkToNormalizedLinkDemographics` function |

## Performance Considerations
The test case involves the normalization of a single `PatientNetworkLink` object, which is not likely to have significant performance implications. However, if the `patientNetworkLinkToNormalizedLinkDemographics` function is used in a production environment with large datasets, its performance characteristics should be considered.

## Notes on Normalization
The test case reveals several normalization steps performed by the `patientNetworkLinkToNormalizedLinkDemographics` function:

1. Date of Birth (DOB): Trims whitespace and normalizes format.
2. Gender: Converts from code ("F") to full word ("female").
3. Names: Lowercases all names and creates combinations of given names with the family name.
4. Addresses: Lowercases and normalizes address components, ensures consistent formatting.
5. Phone Numbers: Removes non-digit characters and normalizes format.
6. Emails: Lowercases and trims whitespace.
7. Drivers Licenses and SSNs: These fields are present in the expected output but are empty arrays, suggesting that the current implementation might not process these fields yet.

The test case uses `JSON.stringify` with sorted keys for names and addresses, likely to ensure consistent ordering when comparing objects.
