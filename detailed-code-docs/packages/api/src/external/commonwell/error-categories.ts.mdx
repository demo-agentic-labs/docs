## High-level description
This code implements functionality for querying and processing medical documents from CommonWell Health Alliance (CW) for a given patient. It handles document reference retrieval, document downloading, conversion to FHIR format, and storage in S3 and a FHIR server.

## Code Structure
The main function `queryAndProcessDocuments` orchestrates the entire process, calling other functions like `internalGetDocuments` for querying CW, and `downloadDocsAndUpsertFHIR` for downloading and processing the documents. These functions use various utility functions and external services for tasks such as error handling, progress tracking, and data conversion.

## Symbols

### `queryAndProcessDocuments`
#### Description
This is the main entry point for querying and processing documents from CommonWell for a given patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient to query for |
| facilityId | string \| undefined | The facility to query for (optional) |
| forceQuery | boolean | Whether to force a query even if waiting for enhanced coverage |
| forcePatientDiscovery | boolean | Whether to force patient discovery |
| forceDownload | boolean | Whether to force download of documents |
| ignoreDocRefOnFHIRServer | boolean | Whether to ignore existing document references on FHIR server |
| ignoreFhirConversionAndUpsert | boolean | Whether to skip FHIR conversion and upsert |
| requestId | string | Unique identifier for the request |
| getOrgIdExcludeList | () =&gt; Promise&lt;string[]&gt; | Function to get organization IDs to exclude |
| triggerConsolidated | boolean | Whether to trigger consolidated processing |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if CommonWell is enabled for the customer and facility
2. Sets up document query progress tracking
3. Retrieves patient data and checks status
4. Queries CommonWell for document references
5. Downloads documents and processes them (conversion to FHIR, storage in S3 and FHIR server)
6. Handles errors and updates progress

### `internalGetDocuments`
#### Description
Queries CommonWell for document references for a given patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | PatientWithCWData | The patient to query for |
| initiator | HieInitiator | Information about the initiator of the query |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| documents | Document[] | Array of document references from CommonWell |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up CommonWell API client
2. Queries CommonWell for documents
3. Processes the response, separating documents and errors
4. Reports any errors encountered
5. Formats and returns the document references

### `downloadDocsAndUpsertFHIR`
#### Description
Downloads documents from CommonWell, stores them in S3, converts them to FHIR if applicable, and stores the results in the FHIR server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | Patient | The patient the documents belong to |
| facilityId | string \| undefined | The facility ID |
| documents | Document[] | Array of document references to process |
| forceDownload | boolean | Whether to force download even if already in S3 |
| ignoreDocRefOnFHIRServer | boolean | Whether to ignore existing document references on FHIR server |
| ignoreFhirConversionAndUpsert | boolean | Whether to skip FHIR conversion and upsert |
| requestId | string | Unique identifier for the request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| docsNewLocation | DocumentReference[] | Array of processed document references |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prepares document references with Metriport IDs
2. Checks which documents need to be downloaded (not in S3 or not in FHIR server)
3. Downloads documents in chunks, with delays to avoid overloading servers
4. Converts applicable documents to FHIR format
5. Uploads documents to S3 and upserts to FHIR server
6. Tracks progress and handles errors throughout the process

## Error Handling
The code implements extensive error handling, including:
- Capturing and reporting errors to an external service (likely Sentry)
- Logging errors for debugging
- Updating progress status in case of failures
- Handling specific error types (e.g., NotFoundError for documents not found in CommonWell)

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging utility (`Util.out`) to log important events and errors throughout the process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/commonwell-sdk | Interacting with CommonWell Health Alliance API |
| @metriport/core | Various utility functions and domain models |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | FHIR type definitions |

## Configuration
The code uses various configuration options, including:
- `DOC_DOWNLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE`: Number of documents to download in each chunk
- `DOC_DOWNLOAD_JITTER_DELAY_MAX_MS`: Maximum delay between individual document downloads
- `DOC_DOWNLOAD_CHUNK_DELAY_MAX_MS`: Maximum delay between chunks of document downloads

## Performance Considerations
- The code implements chunking and delays to avoid overloading servers during document downloads
- It uses `Promise.allSettled` for parallel processing of documents within chunks
- The code checks for existing documents in S3 and FHIR server to avoid unnecessary downloads and processing
