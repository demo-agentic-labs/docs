title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, defines the TypeScript compiler options specifically for the `external` directory within the `packages/api` directory. It inherits base configurations from a parent `tsconfig.json` file and applies additional settings for stricter type checking and file inclusion/exclusion.

## Symbols
### `tsconfig.json`
#### Description
This JSON file configures the TypeScript compiler for the `external` directory. It extends a base configuration, enforces strict type checking for indexed access, includes all TypeScript files within the directory, and excludes test files.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration file, not a code symbol with inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration file, not a code symbol with outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- **`extends "../../tsconfig.json"`**: Inherits compiler options from a parent `tsconfig.json` file located two levels up in the directory structure.
- **`compilerOptions`**: Defines specific compiler options for this directory.
    - **`noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true`**: Enforces strict type checking for indexed access, requiring explicit checks for `undefined` when accessing array elements or object properties by index.
- **`include": ["./**/*"]`**: Includes all TypeScript files (`.ts` and `.tsx`) within the `external` directory and its subdirectories.
- **`exclude": ["./**/*.test.ts"]`**: Excludes all test files (files ending with `.test.ts`) within the `external` directory and its subdirectories from compilation.

## Dependencies
N/A - This configuration file doesn't directly specify external library dependencies.

## Configuration
This file itself defines the configuration for the TypeScript compiler in the `external` directory.
