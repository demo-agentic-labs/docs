## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines the development environment for a Node.js application with PostgreSQL database and DynamoDB. It sets up three services: the main application, a DynamoDB instance, and a PostgreSQL database, all connected through a custom network.

## Code Structure
The file defines a Docker Compose configuration with version 3.8. It creates a custom network and three services: app, dynamodb, and postgres.

## Symbols

### `networks`
#### Description
Defines a custom bridge network named "metriportNetwork" for the services to communicate.

### `services`
#### Description
Defines the three main services of the application: app, dynamodb, and postgres.

### `app`
#### Description
Configures the main Node.js application service.

#### Internal Logic
- Builds the app using a Dockerfile in the parent directory
- Sets up environment variables for database connection and application settings
- Maps ports for the application and debugging
- Mounts volumes for live code updates
- Depends on the postgres service
- Connects to the custom network

### `dynamodb`
#### Description
Sets up a local DynamoDB instance for development.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the amazon/dynamodb-local image
- Exposes port 8000
- Connects to the custom network

### `postgres`
#### Description
Configures the PostgreSQL database service.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses PostgreSQL 14.4 Alpine image
- Sets environment variables for database credentials
- Exposes port 5432
- Implements a health check
- Connects to the custom network

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Node.js | Main application runtime |
| PostgreSQL | Primary database |
| DynamoDB | Authentication token management |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DB_CREDS | JSON | \{"password":"admin","dbname":"db","engine":"postgres","port":5432,"host":"postgres","username":"admin"\} | Database credentials |
| NODE_ENV | String | development | Node.js environment |
| ENV_TYPE | String | dev | Environment type |
| POSTGRES_USER | String | admin | PostgreSQL username |
| POSTGRES_PASSWORD | String | admin | PostgreSQL password |
| POSTGRES_DB | String | db | PostgreSQL database name |

## Performance Considerations
The PostgreSQL service is configured with a maximum of 350 connections, which may need adjustment based on the application's requirements and expected load.
