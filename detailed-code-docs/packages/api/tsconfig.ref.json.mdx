title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.ref.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically designed for creating a project reference within the `packages/api` directory. It extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration and sets up the project for use in a composite build setup.

## Symbols

### Configuration Object
#### Description
The configuration object defines TypeScript compiler options and project settings for the `packages/api` directory.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base `tsconfig.json` file, inheriting its configurations.
2. Specifies the files to include in the compilation process.
3. Sets compiler options specific to this project reference configuration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./tsconfig.json | Base TypeScript configuration that this file extends |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "./tsconfig.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array of strings | ["src/**/*"] | Defines which files to include in the compilation process |
| compilerOptions.composite | boolean | true | Enables TypeScript's project references feature |

## Notes
1. The `extends` field indicates that this configuration builds upon the settings defined in `./tsconfig.json`, which likely contains common compiler options for the entire project.

2. The `include` array specifies that all files under the `src` directory and its subdirectories should be included in the compilation process.

3. The `compilerOptions.composite` setting is set to `true`, which is crucial for enabling TypeScript's project references feature. This allows for more efficient and incremental builds in large TypeScript projects by breaking them into smaller, interconnected subprojects.

4. This configuration is likely part of a larger monorepo or multi-package project structure, where the `packages/api` directory represents a specific subproject or module within the larger codebase.

5. By using project references (enabled by `"composite": true`), this configuration allows other parts of the project to reference the `packages/api` module efficiently, potentially improving build times and enabling better code organization in large TypeScript projects.
