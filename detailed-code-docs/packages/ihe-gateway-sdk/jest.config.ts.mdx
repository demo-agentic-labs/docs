title: "jest.config.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file configures Jest for testing a TypeScript project. It sets up different configurations for end-to-end (E2E) tests and regular unit tests, specifying the test environment, file patterns, and setup files.

## Symbols

### `config`
#### Description
This constant defines the Jest configuration object of type `JestConfigWithTsJest`. It specifies various settings for running tests in the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This symbol doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a configuration object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | JestConfigWithTsJest | The Jest configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the preset to "ts-jest" for TypeScript support.
2. Configures the test environment as "node".
3. Enables verbose output.
4. Ignores test files in "/node_modules/" and "/dist/" directories.
5. Sets different test file patterns based on whether it's an E2E test or not.
6. Specifies a setup file to run after the test environment is set up.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ts-jest | Provides TypeScript support for Jest |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| preset | string | "ts-jest" | Specifies the Jest preset for TypeScript support |
| testEnvironment | string | "node" | Sets the test environment to Node.js |
| verbose | boolean | true | Enables verbose output during test execution |
| testPathIgnorePatterns | string[] | ["/node_modules/", "/dist/"] | Specifies patterns for test files to ignore |
| testMatch | string[] | Conditional | Defines patterns to match test files, different for E2E and regular tests |
| setupFilesAfterEnv | string[] | ["./src/__tests__/env-setup.ts"] | Specifies files to run after the test environment is set up |

## Side Effects
The code sets the `ENV_TYPE` environment variable to "development".

## Performance Considerations
The configuration distinguishes between E2E tests and regular tests, which can help in organizing and running different types of tests efficiently.

## Error Handling
This configuration file doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms.
