title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.ref.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically designed for reference projects. It extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration and sets up additional options for compiling TypeScript code in the `src` directory, with a focus on enabling project references.

## Code Structure
The configuration is a JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `include`, and `compilerOptions`.

## Symbols

### Root Configuration Object
#### Description
The root object defines the TypeScript compiler options for a reference project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration.
2. Specifies files to include in the compilation.
3. Sets compiler options specific to reference projects.

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that this configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration inherits all settings from `./tsconfig.json` and can override or add to those settings.

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | array of strings | Glob patterns for files to include |

#### Internal Logic
Includes all files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories for compilation.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This property contains specific options for the TypeScript compiler.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| composite | boolean | Enables features for project references |

#### Internal Logic
Sets `composite` to `true`, which enables TypeScript's project references feature. This allows the project to be used as a dependency in other TypeScript projects, enabling faster and more efficient builds in large codebases.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the existence of a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory, which it extends.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| composite | boolean | true | Enables TypeScript's project references feature |

## Notes
This configuration is specifically tailored for use in a reference project within the ihe-gateway-sdk package. It's designed to work alongside other TypeScript configurations and enables efficient compilation and referencing of the project's TypeScript code.
