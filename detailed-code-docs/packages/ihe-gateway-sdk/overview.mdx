## High-level description
The `packages/ihe-gateway-sdk` directory contains the source code and configuration files for an IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Gateway SDK. This SDK facilitates healthcare interoperability by providing a structured interface for patient discovery, document querying, and document retrieval operations. It is implemented in TypeScript and uses Zod for schema validation and runtime type checking.

## What does it do?
The IHE Gateway SDK enables healthcare systems to perform three key operations:

1. Patient Discovery: Allows searching for and matching patient information across different healthcare systems, supporting cross-community patient identification.

2. Document Query: Provides functionality to search for relevant patient records across various healthcare systems, allowing providers to locate important medical documents.

3. Document Retrieval: Enables the secure transfer of actual medical documents between healthcare institutions, facilitating the exchange of patient records.

These operations are crucial for healthcare interoperability, allowing different systems to communicate and share patient information securely and efficiently. The SDK handles the complexities of IHE protocols and transactions, providing a clean and structured API for developers to integrate these capabilities into their healthcare applications.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SDK is the `src/index.ts` file, which exports various components:

1. `IHEGateway` class: The primary client for interacting with the IHE Gateway.
2. Request and response types for patient discovery, document query, and document retrieval.
3. Schemas for data validation.
4. Utility functions for type checking and data manipulation.

The `src/client` directory contains the `IHEGateway` class implementation, which encapsulates the core functionality for making IHE protocol requests.

The `src/models` directory houses the data structures and schemas for various operations, ensuring consistent data handling throughout the SDK.

## Key Files

1. `src/client/index.ts`:
   - Defines the `IHEGateway` class, which provides methods for patient discovery, document query, and document retrieval.
   - Uses Axios for making HTTP requests to the IHE Gateway.

2. `src/models/document-query-requests.ts` and `src/models/document-query-responses.ts`:
   - Define schemas and types for document query operations.

3. `src/models/document-retrieval-requests.ts` and `src/models/document-retrieval-responses.ts`:
   - Contain structures for document retrieval requests and responses.

4. `src/models/patient-discovery-requests.ts` and `src/models/patient-discovery-responses.ts`:
   - Provide schemas for patient discovery operations.

5. `src/models/patient.ts`:
   - Defines a comprehensive patient data model.

6. `src/models/shared.ts`:
   - Contains common schemas and types used across the SDK.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on the following key external libraries:

1. Zod: Used extensively for schema definition and runtime type checking.
2. Axios: Employed for making HTTP requests in the `IHEGateway` class.
3. dayjs: Utilized for date and time operations.
4. @metriport/shared: Provides shared utilities and functions used across Metriport packages.

These dependencies were chosen for their reliability and widespread use in the TypeScript ecosystem. Zod provides robust schema validation, Axios is a popular choice for HTTP requests, and dayjs offers a lightweight solution for date manipulation.

## Configuration
The SDK uses schemas as a form of configuration. These schemas define the expected structure of requests and responses, effectively configuring how the SDK interacts with various healthcare information exchange systems.

Key configurable aspects include:
- Patient attributes (e.g., name, address, identifiers)
- Document classification codes
- Request and response structures for different operations
- SAML attributes for security assertions

For example, the `patientResourceSchema` in `src/models/patient.ts` defines the structure for patient information:

```typescript
const patientResourceSchema = z.object({
  resourceType: z.literal("Patient").optional(),
  id: z.string().optional(),
  name: z.array(nameSchema),
  gender: genderSchema,
  birthDate: z.string(),
  address: z.array(addressSchema).optional(),
  telecom: z.array(telecomSchema).optional(),
  identifier: z.array(personalIdentifierSchema).optional(),
});
```

This schema ensures that patient data adheres to a specific structure, with required fields like name, gender, and birthDate, and optional fields like address and telecom information.

The SDK also includes configuration files for TypeScript compilation (`tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.ref.json`) and ESLint (`eslintrc.js`), which set up the development environment with strict type-checking and linting rules to ensure high-quality, type-safe code.

In conclusion, the IHE Gateway SDK provides a robust and type-safe foundation for handling various healthcare interoperability operations. It ensures that data exchange follows IHE standards and can be reliably processed by both the SDK and the systems it interacts with, facilitating seamless integration of healthcare data exchange capabilities into applications.
