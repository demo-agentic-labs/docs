## High-level description
This file defines constant objects used for testing purposes in the IHE Gateway SDK. It contains three main test objects: `testInboundXCPD`, `testInboundDQ`, and `testInboundDR`, which represent different types of inbound messages or requests in the healthcare interoperability context.

## Symbols

### `testInboundXCPD`
#### Description
This constant object represents a test inbound Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) message. It contains patient demographic information and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) attributes for authentication and authorization.

#### Inputs
This is a constant object, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| testInboundXCPD | Object | A test object representing an inbound XCPD message |

#### Internal Logic
The object contains the following key information:
1. Message ID and timestamp
2. SAML attributes for the requester (e.g., role, organization)
3. Patient resource with demographic information (e.g., name, gender, birthdate, address)

___

### `testInboundDQ`
#### Description
This constant object represents a test inbound Document Query (DQ) message. It contains information about the requester and the query parameters for retrieving patient documents.

#### Inputs
This is a constant object, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| testInboundDQ | Object | A test object representing an inbound Document Query message |

#### Internal Logic
The object contains the following key information:
1. Message ID and timestamp
2. SAML attributes for the requester
3. External gateway patient identifier
4. Entry status, type, and class codes for document filtering

___

### `testInboundDR`
#### Description
This constant object represents a test inbound Document Retrieve (DR) message. It contains information about the requester and the specific documents to be retrieved.

#### Inputs
This is a constant object, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| testInboundDR | Object | A test object representing an inbound Document Retrieve message |

#### Internal Logic
The object contains the following key information:
1. Message ID and timestamp
2. SAML attributes for the requester
3. An array of document references, each containing:
   - Home Community ID
   - Repository Unique ID
   - Document Unique ID

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly import any external libraries or modules.

## Configuration
This file doesn't define any configuration options. It only contains constant test data.

## Error Handling
This file doesn't implement any error handling mechanisms as it only defines constant objects.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't expose an API directly, the constant objects defined here can be used in other parts of the IHE Gateway SDK for testing purposes. They represent the structure of different types of inbound messages that the SDK might need to handle.
