## High-level description
This file (packages/ihe-gateway-sdk/src/index.ts) serves as the main entry point for the IHE Gateway SDK. It exports various types, interfaces, and functions related to IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) transactions, including patient discovery, document query, and document retrieval.

## Code Structure
The file primarily consists of export statements, making various components from different modules available for use by consumers of this SDK. These exports include request and response types, schemas for data validation, and utility functions for type checking and data manipulation.

## Symbols
