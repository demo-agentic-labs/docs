title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.ref.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically designed for reference projects. It extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration and adds settings to enable the project to be used as a reference in other TypeScript projects.

## Code Structure
The configuration file consists of a single JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `include`, and `compilerOptions`.

## Symbols

### Root Configuration Object
#### Description
The root object defines the TypeScript compiler options and project structure for a reference project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base configuration from `./tsconfig.json`.
2. Specifies files to include in the compilation.
3. Sets compiler options specific to reference projects.

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that this configuration file extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

### `include`
#### Description
This property specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | array of strings | Glob patterns for files to include |

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This property sets specific compiler options for the TypeScript compiler.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| composite | boolean | Enables features for composite TypeScript projects |

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the existence of a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory, which it extends.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| composite | boolean | true | Enables TypeScript's project references feature |

## Notes
1. This configuration is specifically tailored for creating a reference project, which can be used by other TypeScript projects.
2. The `composite` option in `compilerOptions` is set to `true`, which is crucial for enabling TypeScript's project references feature. This allows other projects to reference this project efficiently.
3. The `include` array specifies that all files under the `src` directory (and its subdirectories) should be included in the compilation process.
4. By extending `./tsconfig.json`, this configuration inherits all settings from the base configuration file while adding or overriding specific options for reference projects.
