## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for phone number validation and normalization functions. It tests the `isPhoneValid`, `normalizeUsPhoneWithPlusOne`, and `normalizePhoneNumber` functions from the `phone.ts` module, ensuring they correctly handle various phone number formats and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `describe("phone")`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the phone module, containing nested `describe` blocks for each function being tested.

### `describe("isPhoneValid")`
#### Description
Tests the `isPhoneValid` function, which checks if a given phone number is valid (10 digits, no non-numeric characters).

#### Internal Logic
- Tests valid 10-digit phone numbers
- Tests invalid inputs (undefined, null, non-numeric characters, length != 10)
- Checks various non-numeric characters

### `describe("normalizeUsPhoneWithPlusOne")`
#### Description
Tests the `normalizeUsPhoneWithPlusOne` function, which normalizes US phone numbers, potentially with a +1 country code.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests removal of non-digit characters
- Tests various phone formats (with spaces, dashes, parentheses)
- Tests handling of country codes (+1, 1)
- Tests handling of phone numbers with fewer than 10 digits

### `describe("normalizePhoneNumber")`
#### Description
Tests the `normalizePhoneNumber` function, which normalizes phone numbers to a 10-digit format.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests with a mock normalizer function
- Tests removal of country code for 11-digit numbers starting with 1
- Tests handling of various country codes and digit lengths
- Tests truncation of numbers longer than 10 digits

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| isPhoneValid | Function to validate phone numbers |
| normalizeUsPhoneWithPlusOne | Function to normalize US phone numbers |
| normalizePhoneNumber | Function to normalize general phone numbers |

## Error Handling
The tests check for correct behavior with invalid inputs, such as undefined, null, or strings containing non-numeric characters.

## Performance Considerations
The tests include multiple iterations over sets of test cases, which could impact test execution time for large sets. However, this is unlikely to be a significant concern for the current test suite.
