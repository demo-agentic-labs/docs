## High-level description
This directory contains modules for handling contact-related operations, specifically focusing on email and phone number validation and normalization. It provides utility functions to ensure consistency and proper formatting of contact information across the application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key functions related to contact information:

1. Email handling:
   - Validates email addresses to ensure they are properly formatted.
   - Normalizes email addresses by trimming whitespace and converting to lowercase.
   - Provides a strict email normalization function that both normalizes and validates.

2. Phone number handling:
   - Validates phone numbers to ensure they contain only digits and are of the correct length.
   - Normalizes US phone numbers by removing non-numeric characters and handling country codes.
   - Provides functions for general phone number normalization, including handling various formats and country codes.
   - Offers a strict phone number normalization function that both normalizes and validates.

3. Testing:
   - Includes comprehensive unit tests for the phone number validation and normalization functions, ensuring they correctly handle various input formats and edge cases.

These functions help maintain data consistency and integrity when dealing with user contact information, which is crucial for many applications, especially those involving communication or user management.

## Key Files

### email.ts
This file contains functions for email handling:

- `exampleEmail`: A constant providing an example email address.
- `isEmailValid`: Validates an email address using the Zod library.
- `normalizeEmail`: Normalizes an email by trimming and converting to lowercase.
- `normalizeEmailStrict`: Strictly normalizes and validates an email, throwing an error if invalid.

### phone.ts
This file provides functions for phone number operations:

- `phoneLength` and `examplePhoneNumber`: Constants defining the expected phone number length and an example.
- `isPhoneValid`: Validates a phone number based on length and content.
- `normalizeUsPhoneWithPlusOne`: Normalizes US phone numbers, handling country codes.
- `normalizePhoneNumber`: Normalizes general phone numbers to a 10-digit format.
- `normalizePhoneNumberStrict`: Strictly normalizes and validates a phone number, throwing an error if invalid.

### __tests__/phone.test.ts
This file contains unit tests for the phone number functions, ensuring they correctly handle various input formats and edge cases.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries:

1. Zod (version not specified):
   - Used for email validation in the `isEmailValid` function.
   - Chosen for its robust schema validation capabilities and TypeScript integration.

2. @metriport/shared (version not specified):
   - Imports the `stripNonNumericChars` function for removing non-numeric characters from strings.
   - Likely chosen for consistency across the Metriport project and to avoid code duplication.

## Configuration
This directory does not appear to use any specific configuration files or environment variables. The behavior of the functions is primarily determined by the constants defined within the code, such as `phoneLength` and `examplePhoneNumber`.

## Code Examples

Here are some examples of how the key functions in this directory can be used:

1. Validating and normalizing an email address:

```typescript
const email = "  User@Example.COM  ";
const normalizedEmail = normalizeEmail(email);
console.log(normalizedEmail); // "user@example.com"

if (isEmailValid(normalizedEmail)) {
  console.log("Email is valid");
} else {
  console.log("Email is invalid");
}
```

2. Normalizing and validating a phone number:

```typescript
const phoneNumber = "+1 (123) 456-7890";
try {
  const normalizedPhone = normalizePhoneNumberStrict(phoneNumber);
  console.log(normalizedPhone); // "1234567890"
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Invalid phone number:", error.message);
}
```

3. Using the US-specific phone normalization:

```typescript
const usPhone = "(800) FLOWERS";
const normalizedUsPhone = normalizeUsPhoneWithPlusOne(usPhone);
console.log(normalizedUsPhone); // "800356937"
```

These utility functions provide a robust way to handle contact information, ensuring consistency and validity across an application. They can be particularly useful in form validation, data processing, and maintaining clean user data in databases.
