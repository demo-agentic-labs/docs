## References
The `metriportCompanyDetails` object is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/api/src/external/carequality/command/cq-directory/create-or-update-cq-organization.ts`, it's used to populate the contact name and phone number when creating or updating a Carequality organization.

2. In `packages/api/src/external/carequality/__tests__/cq.register-facility.test.ts`, it's used in test cases to verify that the correct company details are being used when registering facilities.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a simple declaration of a constant object.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a simple constant object, there are no significant performance considerations. It's a lightweight, in-memory object that can be quickly accessed when needed.

## Notes
1. The comment "AKA Metriport, info" at the beginning of the file suggests that this object might also be referred to as "Metriport info" in other parts of the codebase or documentation.

2. The use of this centralized object for company details is a good practice for maintaining consistency across the application. If any of these details change, they only need to be updated in this one location.

3. The phone number is stored as a string, which is appropriate for phone numbers as they may contain formatting characters.

4. The postal code is also stored as a string, which is correct as postal codes can sometimes contain letters (in some countries) and leading zeros.

5. This file seems to be part of a shared package (`@metriport/shared`), indicating that these details are likely used across multiple parts of the Metriport application or even multiple applications within the Metriport ecosystem.
