#### Description
An interface that defines the structure for a webhook status response.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

| webhookStatusDetail | string \| undefined | Optional details about the webhook status |
| webhookRequestsProcessing | number | The number of webhook requests currently being processed |

## References
This interface is referenced in the `MetriportMedicalApi` class in the related code snippet, specifically in the `getWebhookStatus` method:

```typescript
async getWebhookStatus(): Promise&lt;WebhookStatusResponse&gt; {
  const resp = await this.api.get&lt;WebhookStatusResponse&gt;("/settings/webhook", {
    ...this.optionsForSettingsEndpoints,
  });
  return resp.data;
}
```

This method retrieves the webhook status from the API and returns it as a `WebhookStatusResponse` object.
