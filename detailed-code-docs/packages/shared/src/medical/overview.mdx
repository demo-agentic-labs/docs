## High-level description

This directory contains TypeScript code related to medical data processing, focusing on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) implementation and webhook handling. It provides a foundation for working with FHIR data and managing webhook requests in a healthcare application context.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory accomplishes several key tasks:

1. FHIR Data Handling:
   - Defines interfaces and types for FHIR resources and search results.
   - Specifies allowed conversion types for consolidation operations (HTML, PDF, JSON).
   - Lists various FHIR resource types that can be searched or used in consolidation operations.

2. Webhook Management:
   - Defines schemas and types for different webhook request types (e.g., ping, consolidated data, document download).
   - Provides utility functions for type checking webhook requests.
   - Structures webhook status responses for efficient communication.

3. Centralized Exports:
   - The index.ts file serves as a central point for exporting all the functionalities, making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use these medical-related features.

This codebase enables developers to work with FHIR data in a type-safe manner, handle various webhook requests, and maintain consistency across the application when dealing with medical data and API communications.

## Key Files

1. fhir/bundle.ts:
   Defines the `SearchSetBundle` interface for FHIR search result bundles.

2. fhir/conversion.ts:
   Specifies allowed conversion types for consolidation operations.

3. fhir/resources.ts:
   Contains constants and types related to FHIR resources, including lists of resource types for various operations.

4. webhook/webhook-request.ts:
   Core file for webhook handling, defining schemas and utility functions for different webhook types.

   Example of a webhook type schema:
   ```typescript
   const pingWebhookTypeSchema = z.literal("ping");
   ```

5. webhook/webhook-status-response.ts:
   Defines the `WebhookStatusResponse` interface for representing webhook communication status.

   ```typescript
   interface WebhookStatusResponse {
     webhookEnabled: boolean;
     webhookStatusDetail?: string;
     webhookRequestsProcessing: number;
     webhookRequestsFailed: number;
   }
   ```

6. index.ts:
   Centralizes exports from all submodules, making it easier to import medical-related functionalities.

## Dependencies

The main external dependencies used in this directory are:

1. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides FHIR-specific types, ensuring consistency with the FHIR specification.

2. Zod: Used for schema validation in webhook handling. Zod was likely chosen for its type inference capabilities and ease of creating complex schemas.

Example of Zod usage:
```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const webhookTypeSchema = z.union([pingWebhookTypeSchema, mapiWebhookTypeSchema]);
```

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files, several constants act as configuration data:

1. In fhir/resources.ts:
   `resourceTypeForConsolidation` determines which FHIR resource types can be included in consolidation operations.

2. In fhir/conversion.ts:
   `consolidationConversionType` specifies the allowed conversion formats.

3. In webhook/webhook-request.ts:
   Various webhook type schemas serve as configuration for the webhook system.

Example of how these constants might be used:

```typescript
import { ConsolidationConversionType } from './fhir/conversion';
import { ResourceTypeForConsolidation } from './fhir/resources';

function consolidateResources(
  resourceType: ResourceTypeForConsolidation,
  conversionType: ConsolidationConversionType
) {
  // Implementation details...
}

// Usage
consolidateResources('Patient', 'pdf');
```

This structure allows for easy extension and modification of supported resource types, conversion formats, and webhook types without changing the core logic of the application.
