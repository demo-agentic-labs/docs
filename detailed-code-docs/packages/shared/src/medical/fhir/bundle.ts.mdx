## High-level description
This code defines a `SearchSetBundle` interface that extends the `Bundle` type from the FHIR specification, specifically for search results. It ensures that the `type` property is set to "searchset" for these bundles.

## Symbols

### `SearchSetBundle`
#### Description
An interface that represents a FHIR Bundle specifically for search results. It extends the `Bundle` type from `@medplum/fhirtypes` but narrows the `type` property to always be "searchset".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| T | `Resource` | A generic type parameter that extends `Resource`, defaulting to `Resource` if not specified |

#### Outputs
The interface itself, which can be used as a type annotation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides the `Bundle` and `Resource` types from the FHIR specification |

This code is a small but important part of a larger system dealing with FHIR resources. It ensures type safety when working with search result bundles in the FHIR context. The `SearchSetBundle` interface can be used throughout the application to represent and work with search results in a type-safe manner.
