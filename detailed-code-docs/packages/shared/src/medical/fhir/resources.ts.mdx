## High-level description
This code defines constants and types related to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) resources. It specifically lists various resource types that can be searched by patient, subject, or are considered general resources. These constants are used to define the scope of resources that can be consolidated or searched in a medical context.

## Code Structure
The code defines four main constants:
1. `resourcesSearchableByPatient`: An array of resource types that can be searched by patient.
2. `resourcesSearchableBySubject`: An array of resource types that can be searched by subject.
3. `generalResources`: An array of general resource types.
4. `resourceTypeForConsolidation`: A combination of all the above resource types.

It also defines a type `ResourceTypeForConsolidation` based on the `resourceTypeForConsolidation` constant.
