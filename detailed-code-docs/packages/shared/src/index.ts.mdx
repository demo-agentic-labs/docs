## High-level description
This file (packages/shared/src/index.ts) serves as the main export point for a shared library, consolidating and re-exporting various utility functions, types, and classes from different modules within the project. It provides a centralized access point for common functionalities used across the application, including data validation, error handling, and domain-specific operations.

## Code Structure
The file consists entirely of export statements, organized into logical groups based on functionality or domain. It imports from various subdirectories within the project, such as common, domain, error, and net, and re-exports their contents.

## Symbols

### Exported Symbols
The file exports numerous symbols, including functions, types, and classes. Here are some notable exports:

1. Data manipulation and validation:
   - `toArray`, `isTrue`, `dateSchema`, `optionalDateSchema`
   - `getDomainFromEmailWithoutTld`, `isValidUrl`, `normalizeOid`, `toTitleCase`
   - `validateNPI`, `stringToBoolean`

2. Domain-specific exports:
   - Address-related: `state`, `zip`
   - Contact-related: `email`, `phone`
   - Other: `dob`, `externalId`, `gender`

3. Error handling:
   - `BadRequestError`, `MetriportError`, `NotFoundError`, `errorToString`

4. Networking and retry logic:
   - `retry`, `sleep`, `net/error`, `net/retry`, `net/url`

5. Enums and constants:
   - `PurposeOfUse`, `metriportCompanyDetails`, `metriportOrganization`

6. Types:
   - `AtLeastOne`

7. Medical-related exports:
   - `medical` (exported as a namespace)

## Dependencies
The file doesn't directly import external libraries, but it re-exports symbols that may depend on external libraries used in the imported modules.

## API/Interface Reference
This file doesn't define an API directly but serves as an aggregation point for various utilities and types that can be used throughout the application. Developers can import these exported symbols from this central location instead of accessing individual files.

## Notes
1. The file uses a mix of named exports and namespace exports (e.g., `export * as medical`).
2. Some exports are grouped by domain (e.g., address, contact) while others are grouped by functionality (e.g., error handling, networking).
3. The `interface` module is exported twice, which might be a mistake or have a specific purpose not evident from this file alone.

This index file provides a clean and organized way to access shared functionality across the project, promoting code reuse and maintaining a clear structure for common utilities and types.
