## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `sleep` that creates a Promise-based delay for a specified amount of time in milliseconds. It's a simple implementation of asynchronous waiting in TypeScript.

## Symbols

### `sleep`
#### Description
The `sleep` function creates a Promise that resolves after a specified time delay. It's useful for introducing pauses in asynchronous code execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timeInMs | number | The time to wait in milliseconds |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A Promise that resolves after the specified delay |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses JavaScript's `setTimeout` function wrapped in a Promise. It creates a new Promise and uses `setTimeout` to delay the resolution of the Promise by the specified time.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses built-in JavaScript functions (`Promise` and `setTimeout`).

## Usage Examples
While not shown in the target file, the related code snippet demonstrates how the `sleep` function is typically used:

1. In test scenarios to introduce delays:
   ```typescript
   await sleep(100);
   ```

2. To wait for background processes to complete:
   ```typescript
   await sleep(waitTimeBetweenPdAndDq.asMilliseconds());
   ```

These examples show that `sleep` is often used in testing and when dealing with asynchronous operations that require a delay.

## Performance Considerations
The `sleep` function should be used judiciously, especially in production code, as it introduces deliberate delays which can impact performance. It's more commonly used in testing scenarios or when dealing with rate-limited APIs or operations that require cooldown periods.

In the related code, it's used to wait for asynchronous operations to complete, such as patient creation and updates, before proceeding with further actions or assertions. This ensures that the system has had enough time to process changes before they are verified.
