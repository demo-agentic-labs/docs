## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for various utility functions in the shared common module. The tests cover functionality related to boolean operations, Object Identifier (OID) normalization, retry mechanisms, and string manipulation. These tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the common utility functions used across the project.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory verifies the behavior of several utility functions:

1. Boolean operations: It tests the `isTrue` function, which determines if a given input should be considered as true.
2. OID normalization: It checks the `normalizeOid` function, which validates and standardizes Object Identifiers.
3. Retry mechanisms: It tests functions like `executeWithRetries` and `executeWithRetriesSafe`, which implement retry logic for operations that may fail.
4. String manipulation: It verifies the `limitStringLength` function, which truncates strings to a specified length while adding a suffix if necessary.

These tests ensure that the utility functions behave correctly under various input conditions, handle edge cases appropriately, and maintain their expected functionality.

## Key Files

1. `boolean.test.ts`: Tests the `isTrue` function, covering various input types and edge cases.
2. `normalize-oid.test.ts`: Verifies the `normalizeOid` function's ability to handle valid and invalid OIDs, as well as OIDs with surrounding junk characters.
3. `retry.test.ts`: Tests the retry functionality, including `executeWithRetries`, `defaultGetTimeToWait`, and `executeWithRetriesSafe` functions.
4. `string.test.ts`: Checks the `limitStringLength` function's behavior with different input strings and configuration options.

## Dependencies
The test files use the following external libraries:

1. @faker-js/faker: Used to generate random test data, particularly in `boolean.test.ts` and `string.test.ts`.

## Configuration
The tests do not rely on specific configuration files or environment variables. However, they do use various test parameters and mock functions to simulate different scenarios and edge cases.

Key testing patterns and configurations include:

1. Use of `describe` blocks to group related tests.
2. Use of `it` or `test` functions to define individual test cases.
3. Use of `expect` assertions to verify function outputs and behaviors.
4. Mock functions created using `jest.fn()` to simulate behavior and track function calls.
5. Random data generation using `faker` to test a wide range of inputs.

For example, in the retry tests, small delay values are used to ensure fast test execution while still testing the retry logic:

```javascript
const result = await executeWithRetries(fn, {
  maxAttempts: 3,
  initialDelay: 1,
  maxDelay: 10,
});
```

The tests are designed to be comprehensive, covering normal use cases, edge cases, and error scenarios. They ensure that the utility functions in the common module behave correctly and consistently across different parts of the project that depend on them.
