title: "retry.test.ts"

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the retry functionality implemented in the `retry.ts` file. It tests various scenarios of the `executeWithRetries`, `defaultGetTimeToWait`, and `executeWithRetriesSafe` functions, ensuring they behave correctly under different conditions and with various input parameters.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into several `describe` blocks, each focusing on a specific function or aspect of the retry functionality. Within these blocks, individual test cases are defined using `it` or `test` functions.

## Symbols

### `describe("retry")`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the retry functionality.

### `describe("executeWithRetries")`
#### Description
Tests the `executeWithRetries` function under various scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a mock function `fn` before each test.
2. Tests successful execution on the first attempt.
3. Tests retry behavior on initial failure.
4. Tests maximum retry attempts.
5. Tests custom `shouldRetry` function.
6. Tests initial values passed to `getTimeToWait`.
7. Tests custom `initialDelay` and `maxDelay` values.

### `describe("executeWithRetriesOnResult")`
#### Description
Tests the `executeWithRetries` function with result-based retrying.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests successful execution on the first attempt.
2. Tests retrying on retryable results.
3. Tests returning the last retryable result after max attempts.

### `describe("defaultGetTimeToWait")`
#### Description
Tests the `defaultGetTimeToWait` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests behavior when `backoffMultiplier` is lower than 1.
2. Tests that the returned value is not lower than `initialDelay`.
3. Tests that the returned value is not higher than 2x `initialDelay`.

### `describe("executeWithRetriesSafe")`
#### Description
Tests the `executeWithRetriesSafe` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests that it returns `undefined` when the function fails after all retry attempts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random test data |
| ../retry | The module being tested, containing retry-related functions |

## Error Handling
The tests specifically check error handling scenarios, such as retrying on errors and throwing errors after maximum attempts.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use small delay values (e.g., `initialDelay: 1`) to ensure fast test execution while still testing the retry logic.
