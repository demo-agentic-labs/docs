## High-level description
This file defines a utility function `emptyFunction` that serves as a no-operation (no-op) function. It's primarily used to handle asynchronous promise rejections or as a placeholder where a function is required but no action is needed.

## Symbols

### `emptyFunction`
#### Description
`emptyFunction` is a constant that holds an arrow function that does nothing (no-op). It's defined to suppress warnings about unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous operations and to provide a function that can be used where a function is required but no action needs to be taken.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function returns nothing (undefined).

#### Internal Logic
The function body is intentionally left empty, as its purpose is to do nothing when called.

## Side Effects
This function has no side effects, as it performs no operations.

## Dependencies
This code has no external dependencies.

## Error Handling
The primary purpose of this function is to serve as an error handler, particularly for asynchronous promise rejections. By using this function as a catch handler, unhandled promise rejections can be avoided without performing any specific error handling logic.

## Notes
1. The code includes an ESLint disable comment (`// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-function`) to suppress warnings about empty functions. This is necessary because linters often flag empty functions as potential errors or code smells, but in this case, the empty function is intentional.

2. The function is named `emptyFunction`, which clearly indicates its purpose and behavior to other developers who might use this utility.

3. This utility function can be particularly useful in scenarios where a function is required as an argument or property, but no action needs to be taken. It helps in avoiding null checks or conditional logic in such cases.

4. While simple, this utility can contribute to cleaner and more maintainable code by providing a standardized way to handle scenarios where a no-op function is needed.
