## High-level description
This directory contains network-related utilities and error handling mechanisms for the Metriport application. It includes functions for URL validation, network error handling, and implementing retry logic for network operations. The code is designed to improve the reliability and robustness of network-related functionality within the application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides several key functionalities:

1. URL Validation: It offers a utility function to check if a given string is a valid URL.

2. Network Error Handling: It defines various types of network errors (both Node.js and Axios-specific) and provides utilities to extract and categorize these errors.

3. Retry Mechanism: It implements a sophisticated retry mechanism for network operations, allowing for customizable retry behavior based on specific error codes and HTTP status codes.

4. Testing Utilities: It includes mock implementations and utilities for testing network-related functionality, particularly focusing on Axios mocking and retry mechanism testing.

These functionalities work together to enhance the application's ability to handle network operations reliably, gracefully manage errors, and improve overall robustness when dealing with external services or APIs.

## Key Files

1. `error.ts`:
   - Defines various network error types and codes for both Node.js and Axios.
   - Provides utility functions like `getNetworkErrorDetails` to extract error information.

2. `retry.ts`:
   - Contains the main `executeWithNetworkRetries` function, which implements retry logic for network operations.
   - Includes helper functions for extracting HTTP status codes and error codes from various error types.

3. `url.ts`:
   - Defines the `isValidUrl` function for validating URL strings.

4. `__tests__/retry.test.ts`:
   - Contains comprehensive tests for the retry mechanism, covering various network error scenarios and retry behaviors.

5. `__tests__/axios.ts`:
   - Provides utilities for mocking Axios in Jest tests, allowing simulation of different network scenarios.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries:

1. `axios` (version not specified): Used for making HTTP requests and handling Axios-specific errors.
2. `@faker-js/faker` (version not specified): Utilized in tests for generating fake data.
3. `jest` (version not specified): The testing framework used for writing and running tests.

Internal dependencies include various utility functions and error classes from the shared package.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the retry mechanism is highly configurable through options passed to the `executeWithNetworkRetries` function:

- `retryOnTimeout`: Controls whether timeouts should trigger retries.
- `httpCodesToRetry`: Specifies which HTTP status codes should trigger retries.
- `maxAttempts`: Sets the maximum number of retry attempts.
- `getTimeToWait`: A custom function to calculate wait time between retries, with special handling for rate limiting (HTTP 429).

Default options are provided, but can be overridden as needed:

```typescript
const defaultOptions: ExecuteWithNetworkRetriesOptions = {
  maxAttempts: 3,
  retryOnTimeout: true,
  httpCodesToRetry: [408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
  getTimeToWait: networkGetTimeToWait,
};
```

This configuration allows developers to fine-tune the retry behavior based on specific application requirements and the characteristics of the external services being interacted with.

The code in this directory plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable network operations within the Metriport application. By providing robust error handling, configurable retry mechanisms, and thorough testing utilities, it helps maintain the quality and reliability of the application's network-related functionality.
