### BadRequestError
#### Description
A custom error class for representing bad request errors in the Metriport application. It extends the `MetriportError` class and sets the HTTP status code to 400 (Bad Request).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | string | The error message (optional, has a default value) |
| cause | unknown | The cause of the error (optional) |
| additionalInfo | Record&lt;string, string \| number \| undefined \| null&gt; | Additional information about the error (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `super` constructor with the provided `message`, `cause`, and `additionalInfo`.
2. Sets the `status` property to the numeric value of `httpStatus.BAD_REQUEST` (400).
3. Sets the `name` property to the name of the constructor (i.e., "BadRequestError").

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| http-status | Provides HTTP status codes as constants |

## Error Handling
This class is part of the error handling mechanism in the Metriport application. It's used to represent bad request errors with a specific HTTP status code and additional information.

## Usage Examples
Based on the related code snippets provided, the `BadRequestError` is used in various parts of the application:

1. In `delete-facility.ts`, it's thrown when attempting to delete a facility that has associated patients:
   ```typescript
   throw new BadRequestError(`Cannot delete facility with patients associated to it`);
   ```

2. In `hydrate-bundle.ts`, it's used for various validation errors:
   ```typescript
   throw new BadRequestError(`${entry.resource.resourceType} resource is missing the ID!`);
   throw new BadRequestError(`Invalid UUID: ${oldId}`);
   throw new BadRequestError(`Multiple resources with the same ID: ${oldId}`);
   throw new BadRequestError("Patient reference is pointing to another patient!");
   ```

3. In `delete-facility.test.ts`, it's expected to be thrown when trying to delete a facility with patients:
   ```typescript
   expect(async () =&gt; await deleteFacility(makeFacility())).rejects.toThrow(BadRequestError);
   ```

These examples demonstrate that the `BadRequestError` is used to handle various scenarios where the request is invalid or cannot be processed due to the current state of the system.
