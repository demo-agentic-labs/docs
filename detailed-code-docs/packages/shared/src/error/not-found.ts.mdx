## High-level description
This code defines a custom error class `NotFoundError` that extends the `MetriportError` class. It is specifically designed to represent errors related to resources that cannot be found, with a default HTTP status code of 404 (Not Found).

## Code Structure
The `NotFoundError` class extends `MetriportError` and sets specific properties for not found errors. It uses the `httpStatus` library to set the appropriate status code.

## References
- `MetriportError` from "./metriport-error"
- `httpStatus` from "http-status"

### `NotFoundError`
#### Description
A custom error class for representing "not found" errors in the Metriport system. It extends the `MetriportError` class and sets the HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | string | The error message (optional, default provided) |
| cause | unknown | The underlying cause of the error (optional) |
| additionalInfo | AdditionalInfo | Additional information about the error (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `super` constructor with the provided message, cause, and additionalInfo.
2. Sets the `status` property to the numeric value of `httpStatus.NOT_FOUND` (404).
3. Sets the `name` property to the name of the constructor ("NotFoundError").

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| http-status | Provides HTTP status codes as constants |

## Error Handling
This class is part of the error handling mechanism in the Metriport system. It's used to represent situations where a requested resource cannot be found, providing a standardized way to handle and report such errors.

---

The `NotFoundError` class is designed to be used throughout the Metriport system when a requested resource is not found. It provides a consistent way to handle and report these errors, including the ability to add additional information and an underlying cause.

For example, in the related code snippet from `packages/api/src/command/webhook/webhook-request.ts`, we can see the `NotFoundError` being used:

```typescript
if (!whRequest) throw new NotFoundError(`Could not find webhook request ${id}`);
```

This demonstrates how the `NotFoundError` is utilized in practice to handle cases where a specific resource (in this case, a webhook request) cannot be found in the system.
