## High-level description
This file serves as an index module for the interface package. It re-exports all the symbols from the "internal" and "schema" modules, making them available to other parts of the application that import from this interface package.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two export statements that use the wildcard (*) syntax to re-export all named exports from the "internal" and "schema" modules.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./internal"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "./internal" module. This includes any functions, classes, interfaces, or other symbols defined in the internal module.

### `export * from "./schema"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "./schema" module. This includes any functions, classes, interfaces, or other symbols defined in the schema module.

## References
The code references two other modules:
1. "./internal"
2. "./schema"

These modules are likely located in the same directory as the current file.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly import any external libraries. However, it indirectly depends on the contents of the "internal" and "schema" modules.

Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer that the "internal" module (or at least part of it) uses the following external dependency:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | For schema definition and type inference |

## Notes
1. This file acts as a central point for exporting interface-related functionality, which can simplify imports in other parts of the application.
2. The use of wildcard exports (*) means that any changes to the exports in the "internal" or "schema" modules will automatically be reflected in this index file.
3. While we don't have direct visibility into the "schema" module, it's likely that it also contains schema definitions, possibly using Zod or a similar library.
4. The related code snippet shows that the "internal" module defines at least one schema (internalSendConsolidatedSchema) and its corresponding type (InternalSendConsolidated). These will be among the symbols re-exported by this index file.
5. Developers using this interface package can import all necessary types and schemas from this single file, rather than having to import from multiple sub-modules.
