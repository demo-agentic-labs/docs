## High-level description
This file serves as a central export point for the internal interfaces of the shared package. It re-exports all the symbols from the "consolidated" module, making them available to other parts of the application that import from this index file.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./consolidated"`
#### Description
This is a re-export statement that exports all the symbols (functions, classes, variables, etc.) from the "./consolidated" module. It allows other parts of the application to access these symbols by importing from this index file instead of directly from the "consolidated" module.

#### Inputs
This export statement doesn't have inputs as it's not a function or method.

#### Outputs
All symbols exported from the "./consolidated" module are made available as exports of this module.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./consolidated" | The module from which all symbols are being re-exported |

## References
The code references the "consolidated" module, which is likely another TypeScript file located in the same directory as this index file.

Note: This is a very simple file with a single export statement. Its primary purpose is to aggregate and re-export symbols from other modules, which is a common pattern in TypeScript and JavaScript projects for organizing and simplifying imports.
