## High-level description
This code serves as an index file for exporting schema-related modules, specifically the feedback schema. It facilitates easy access to feedback-related schemas and types from other parts of the application.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single export statement that re-exports all symbols from the "feedback" module.

## References
This code references the "feedback" module, which is likely located in the same directory.

## Symbols

### Export statement
#### Description
The code uses a wildcard export (`export *`) to re-export all symbols from the "feedback" module.

#### Internal Logic
When this file is imported elsewhere in the application, it provides access to all exported symbols from the "feedback" module without the need to import them directly from the feedback file.

## Dependencies
This file indirectly depends on the "zod" library, which is used in the referenced "feedback" module for schema definition.

## Related Code: feedback.ts

The related `feedback.ts` file defines two schemas and their corresponding types using the Zod library:

1. `createFeedbackSchema`: Defines the structure for creating feedback.
2. `createFeedbackEntrySchema`: Defines the structure for creating a feedback entry.

These schemas and types are what's being exported through the index file we're documenting.

### Schemas and Types

#### createFeedbackSchema
- Defines the structure for creating feedback
- Fields:
  - `cxId`: string (required)
  - `entityId`: string (required)
  - `content`: string (required)
  - `version`: string (optional, can be null)
  - `location`: string (optional, can be null)

#### CreateFeedback
- Type inferred from `createFeedbackSchema`

#### createFeedbackEntrySchema
- Defines the structure for creating a feedback entry
- Fields:
  - `feedbackId`: string (required)
  - `comment`: string (required)
  - `name`: string (optional, can be null)

#### CreateFeedbackEntry
- Type inferred from `createFeedbackEntrySchema`

By re-exporting these schemas and types, the index file makes them easily accessible to other parts of the application that need to work with feedback-related data structures.
