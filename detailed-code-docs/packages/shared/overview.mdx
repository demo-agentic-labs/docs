## High-level description
The `packages/shared` directory contains a collection of shared utilities, types, and functions used across the Metriport application. It provides a centralized location for common functionality, including error handling, data validation, network operations, and domain-specific utilities for medical data processing. This shared package is designed to be used by other packages within the Metriport project, promoting code reuse and consistency.

## What does it do?
This shared package serves several key purposes:

1. Common Utilities: It provides a wide range of utility functions for handling arrays, booleans, dates, strings, numbers, and more.

2. Domain-Specific Operations: It includes modules for address validation, contact information processing, date of birth normalization, and gender normalization.

3. Error Handling: It defines custom error classes and utility functions for consistent error management across the application.

4. Medical Data Processing: It contains types and utilities for working with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data and managing webhook requests in a healthcare context.

5. Network Operations: It provides utilities for URL validation, network error handling, and implementing retry logic for network operations.

6. Data Validation: It uses Zod for schema definition and validation, ensuring type safety and consistency in data structures throughout the application.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is the `index.ts` file in the `src` directory, which aggregates and re-exports various utilities, types, and functions from different modules. This allows other parts of the application to easily import and use these shared functionalities.

Key subdirectories include:

- `common`: Contains general-purpose utility functions.
- `domain`: Holds domain-specific utilities and types.
- `error`: Defines custom error classes and error handling utilities.
- `interface`: Provides schemas and types for internal consolidated medical records and a feedback system.
- `medical`: Contains FHIR-related types and webhook handling utilities.
- `net`: Includes network-related utilities and retry mechanisms.

## Dependencies
The shared package relies on several external libraries:

1. Zod: Used for schema validation and type inference.
2. dayjs: Utilized for date parsing and manipulation.
3. lodash: Provides various utility functions.
4. @medplum/fhirtypes: Offers FHIR-specific types.
5. axios: Used for making HTTP requests and handling network errors.
6. @faker-js/faker: Used for generating fake data, likely for testing purposes.

## Configuration
The package uses several configuration files:

1. `package.json`: Defines the package metadata, scripts, dependencies, and export structure.
2. `tsconfig.json`: Configures the TypeScript compiler options, enabling strict type-checking and modern JavaScript features.
3. `tsconfig.ref.json`: Extends the base TypeScript configuration for reference projects.
4. `.eslintrc.js`: Sets up ESLint rules for maintaining code quality and consistency.
5. `jest.config.ts`: Configures the Jest testing framework, adapting based on whether end-to-end (E2E) tests are being run.

These configuration files ensure that the shared package is properly built, linted, and tested, maintaining high code quality and consistency across the Metriport project.
