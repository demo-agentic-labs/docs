## High-level description
The `packages/cda-validator` directory contains a Node.js project that implements a Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) validator. This validator is based on the CDA-core-2.1 standard and provides a server with a `/validate` route to check the validity of Clinical Documents against the CDA schema.

## What does it do?
This project sets up a server that can validate XML documents against the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) schema. Here's a simplified explanation of its functionality:

1. It provides a web service that listens for incoming XML documents.
2. When it receives an XML document, it checks if the document follows the rules defined in the CDA schema.
3. If the document is valid according to the CDA rules, it tells you it's okay.
4. If there are any problems with the document, it points out what's wrong and where the errors are.

This is useful for healthcare systems that need to ensure their clinical documents are correctly formatted and contain all the necessary information as per the CDA standard.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this project is the `server.ts` file. This file sets up an Express server that listens on port 8999 and exposes a `/validate` route. Here's how the code is organized:

1. `server.ts`: This file contains the Express server setup and the main route handler for the `/validate` endpoint. It uses the `xmllint` command-line tool to perform the actual XML validation against the CDA schema.

2. `schema/` directory: This directory contains the CDA schemas used for validation. It's divided into two subdirectories:
   - `normative/`: Contains the original published CDA Schema.
   - `extensions/`: Contains the SDTC folder with updated CDA schema including all approved HL7 SDTC extensions.

The data flow in this project is straightforward:
1. An XML document is sent to the `/validate` endpoint.
2. The server writes this XML to a temporary file.
3. The `xmllint` command is executed to validate the XML against the CDA schema.
4. The validation results are parsed and sent back as a response.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Express (version not specified): A web application framework for Node.js, used to set up the server and handle HTTP requests.
2. TypeScript (version not specified): A typed superset of JavaScript, used for development.
3. ts-node (version not specified): Allows running TypeScript files directly without a separate compilation step.
4. xmllint (not a Node.js dependency): A command-line XML tool used for schema validation.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust, type-safe development environment (TypeScript) with a well-established web framework (Express) and efficient XML validation capabilities (xmllint).

## Configuration
The project uses several configuration files:

1. `.eslintrc.js`: Configures ESLint for TypeScript, extending from recommended rulesets and using the TypeScript parser.

2. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compiler options, extending from the Node.js 18 base configuration and setting specific options for this project.

3. `package.json`: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts. Notable scripts include:
   - `"server": "ts-node server.ts"`: Runs the server using ts-node.

4. Environment variables: The server listens on port 8999 by default, but this could potentially be configured through an environment variable (though not explicitly implemented in the provided code).

The CDA schemas used for validation are located in the `schema/` directory, with the latest version including all extensions in `schema/extensions/SDTC/`.

This project provides a focused, well-structured implementation of a CDA validator service, leveraging modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices and tools to ensure code quality and type safety.
