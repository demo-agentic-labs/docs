## High-level description
This code is a Node.js script that processes a lint results file (`lint-results.txt`). It filters out specific errors and removes redundant file paths from the lint output, then prints the filtered results to the console.

## Symbols

### Main Script
#### Description
The main script reads the `lint-results.txt` file, processes its content by filtering out specific errors and redundant information, and then outputs the filtered results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lint-results.txt | File | The input file containing lint results |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filteredData | String | The processed and filtered lint results, printed to the console |

#### Internal Logic
1. Read the `lint-results.txt` file.
2. Split the file content into lines.
3. Filter out lines containing specific errors defined in `errorsToFilter`.
4. Remove redundant file paths.
5. Remove the last three lines of the filtered results.
6. Join the filtered lines and print the result to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fs | File system operations (reading the input file) |
| path | Handling file paths |

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for file reading operations. If an error occurs while reading the file, it logs the error to the console and exits.

## Side Effects
The script reads from a file named `lint-results.txt` in the current directory and outputs the processed results to the console.

## Performance Considerations
The script processes the file line by line, which is memory-efficient for large files. However, it does create arrays in memory to store the processed lines, which could be a consideration for extremely large input files.

___

### `errorsToFilter`
#### Description
An array of string patterns representing errors that should be filtered out from the lint results.

___

### `fs.readFile` callback function
#### Description
This anonymous function is called after the file is read. It processes the file content and filters the lint results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| err | Error | Any error that occurred during file reading |
| data | String | The content of the read file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Split the file content into lines.
2. Iterate through the lines, filtering out specified errors and their surrounding context.
3. Perform a second round of filtering to remove redundant file paths.
4. Remove the last three lines of the filtered results.
5. Join the filtered lines and print the result to the console.
