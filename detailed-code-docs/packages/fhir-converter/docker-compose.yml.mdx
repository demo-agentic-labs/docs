## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines the configuration for running the FHIR Converter application in a Docker container. It sets up a single service named "fhir-converter" with specific build, deployment, environment, networking, and volume settings for development purposes.

## Symbols

### `fhir-converter` (service)
#### Description
This service configuration defines how the FHIR Converter application should be built and run within a Docker container.

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds the container using the Dockerfile in the current directory.
2. Sets a restart policy to restart the container on failure.
3. Configures environment variables for development.
4. Maps container ports to host ports.
5. Mounts the local `src` directory to `/app/src` in the container.
6. Adds a host entry for Docker host access.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Docker Compose | Orchestration tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications |
| Docker | Containerization platform |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| NODE_ENV | string | development | Sets the Node.js environment |
| ENV_TYPE | string | development | Sets the environment type for the application |

## Performance Considerations
- The use of volume mounting (`./src:/app/src`) allows for real-time code changes without rebuilding the container, which is beneficial for development but may have a slight performance impact.
- Port mapping is configured for both the application (8777:8080) and debugging (9277:9229), which allows for easy access and debugging from the host machine.

## Error Handling
The `restart_policy` is set to `on-failure`, ensuring that the container will automatically restart if it crashes or stops unexpectedly.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| http://localhost:8777 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Main application access point |
| http://localhost:9277 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Debug port for Node.js inspector |

This Docker Compose configuration provides a development-ready setup for the FHIR Converter application, allowing for easy development, debugging, and testing within a containerized environment.
