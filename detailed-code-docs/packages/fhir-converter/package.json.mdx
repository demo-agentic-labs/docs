title: "package.json"
---

## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration, dependencies, and scripts for the FHIR converter project. It specifies the project structure, development tools, and runtime requirements for a Node.js-based FHIR conversion application.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a standard `package.json` for a Node.js project, containing metadata, scripts, dependencies, and configuration settings for various tools used in the development process.

### package.json
#### Description
This is the main configuration file for the FHIR converter project. It defines the project's metadata, scripts, dependencies, and development tools.

#### Internal Logic
The file is organized into several key sections:
1. Project metadata (name, version, description)
2. Main entry point and privacy setting
3. Scripts for various development and runtime tasks
4. ESLint configuration
5. Test coverage configuration (nyc)
6. Development and runtime dependencies
7. License information

## Dependencies
The project uses a variety of dependencies, including:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express | Web application framework |
| handlebars | Templating engine |
| fhir | FHIR data manipulation |
| antlr4 | Parsing tool |
| dayjs | Date manipulation library |
| swagger-jsdoc, swagger-ui-express | API documentation |

Development dependencies include testing tools (jest, supertest) and linting tools (eslint, ember-template-lint).

### Configuration
The package.json file includes several configuration sections:

1. ESLint Configuration:
   - Defines environments, globals, and rules for JavaScript linting
   - Specifies overrides for test files

2. NYC (Test Coverage) Configuration:
   - Sets coverage thresholds
   - Specifies files to include/exclude
   - Defines output formats and directory

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| eslintConfig | Object | - | ESLint configuration settings |
| nyc | Object | - | Test coverage configuration |

## Scripts
The package.json defines several npm scripts for development, testing, and running the application:

| Script | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| clean | Removes node_modules directory |
| build | Runs ESLint |
| pretest | Initializes the service before running tests |
| test | Runs Jest tests |
| prestart | Initializes the service before starting |
| dev | Starts the application in development mode |
| start | Starts the application |
| start-dev | Alias for dev script |
| start-docker-compose | Starts the application using Docker Compose |
| eslint | Runs ESLint on source files |
| lint:hbs | Lints Handlebars templates |
| full-hbs-lint | Runs a full Handlebars lint check |

## Performance Considerations
The project uses the `--experimental-worker` flag for Node.js, which may have performance implications and should be considered for production deployments.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling mechanisms are defined in this configuration file. Error handling would be implemented in the actual application code.

## Logging
No specific logging configuration is present in this file. Logging would likely be handled by the application code or potentially by the `applicationinsights` dependency.

## API/Interface Reference
While no API is directly defined in this file, the presence of Swagger-related dependencies (swagger-jsdoc, swagger-ui-express) suggests that the application likely exposes a documented API.
