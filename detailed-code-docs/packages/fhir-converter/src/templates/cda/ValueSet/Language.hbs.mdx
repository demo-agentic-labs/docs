## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping of language codes to their corresponding full language names. It's designed to convert abbreviated language codes into human-readable language names, focusing primarily on various English variants and a few other languages.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template uses a series of conditional statements to map language codes to their full names. It first converts the input code to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The language code to be converted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The full name of the language corresponding to the input code |

#### Internal Logic
1. The input `code` is converted to lowercase using the `toLower` helper and stored in the `normalizedCode` variable.
2. A series of `if` and `else if` statements check the `normalizedCode` against known language codes.
3. If a match is found, the corresponding full language name is returned as a string.
4. If no match is found, no output is produced.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine and its built-in helpers, as well as a custom `toLower` helper function.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Templating engine used for conditional logic and output generation |
| toLower helper | Custom helper function to convert input to lowercase |

## Supported Languages
The template supports the following language codes:

1. English variants:
   - 'en': English
   - 'en-au': English (Australia)
   - 'en-ca': English (Canada)
   - 'en-in': English (India)
   - 'en-gb': English (Great Britain)
   - 'en-nz': English (New Zealand)
   - 'en-sg': English (Singapore)
   - 'en-us': English (United States)

2. Other languages:
   - 'es': Spanish
   - 'de': German
   - 'da': Danish
   - 'fr': French

Note: If a language code is provided that doesn't match any of these, no output will be generated.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement explicit error handling. If an unrecognized language code is provided, the template will silently produce no output.

## TODOs
- Consider adding more language codes and their corresponding full names to increase the template's coverage.
- Implement a default or error message for unrecognized language codes to improve error handling.
- There's a typo in "English (New Zeland)" which should be corrected to "English (New Zealand)".
