## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for encounter status codes. It converts various input status codes to a standardized set of FHIR encounter status codes, ensuring consistency in the representation of encounter statuses across different systems.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template uses a series of conditional statements to map input status codes to standardized FHIR encounter status codes. It first converts the input code to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The input encounter status code |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | string | The standardized FHIR encounter status code |

#### Internal Logic
1. The input `code` is converted to lowercase using the `toLower` helper function.
2. A series of `if-else` statements check the normalized code against various possible status values.
3. Each matched status is mapped to its corresponding FHIR encounter status.
4. If no match is found, the status defaults to "unknown".

## Mapping Details
The template maps various input statuses to FHIR encounter statuses as follows:

| Input Status (case-insensitive) | FHIR Encounter Status |
|:--------------------------------|:----------------------|
| planned | planned |
| arrived | arrived |
| triaged, accepted | triaged |
| active | in-progress |
| onleave, suspended | onleave |
| normal, complete, completed, finished | finished |
| cancelled, abandoned | cancelled |
| error, entered-in-error | entered-in-error |
| unknown | unknown |

Any input status not matching the above will be mapped to "unknown".

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine and its built-in helpers, as well as a custom `toLower` helper function for case normalization.

## Error Handling
The template does not implement explicit error handling. Unrecognized status codes are implicitly handled by mapping them to the "unknown" status.
