## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for telecom use codes to their corresponding FHIR values. It translates specific CDA telecom use codes into FHIR-compliant telecom use values.

### Main Template
#### Description
The template uses a series of conditional statements to map input codes to their corresponding FHIR telecom use values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The input telecom use code from CDA |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The corresponding FHIR telecom use value |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses a series of `{{#if}}` and `{{else if}}` statements to check the input `code` against known CDA telecom use codes. For each match, it outputs the corresponding FHIR telecom use value. The mapping is as follows:

1. 'HP' or 'H' → 'home'
2. 'WP' → 'work'
3. 'TMP' → 'temp'
4. 'BAD' → 'old'
5. 'MC' → 'mobile'

If none of the above codes match, it defaults to 'temp'.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for its functionality.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
The template does not implement explicit error handling. If an unknown code is provided, it will default to 'temp'.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The mapping seems to be designed to convert CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) telecom use codes to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) telecom use values, facilitating interoperability between these two healthcare data standards.
3. Some CDA codes have direct FHIR equivalents (like 'HP' to 'home'), while others are mapped to approximate equivalents (like 'BAD' to 'old').
4. The default value 'temp' for unknown codes suggests a conservative approach, treating unknown values as temporary rather than assuming a more specific use case.
