## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for allergy categories. It translates specific allergy-related codes into more general categories used in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for allergy intolerance.

## Symbols

### Main Template
#### Description
The template uses a series of conditional statements to map specific allergy-related codes to broader categories.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | A code representing a specific allergy type |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| category | string | A broader category of allergy ("medication", "food", "environment", or "other") |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars' `{{#if}}` and `{{else if}}` statements to check the input `code` against predefined values. Based on the match, it outputs the corresponding category:

1. Codes "416098002", "59037007", and "419511003" map to "medication"
2. Code "414285001" maps to "food"
3. Code "232347008" maps to "environment"
4. Codes "420134006", "418038007", and "419199007" map to "other"

If the input code doesn't match any of these predefined values, no output is produced.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for its functionality.
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Templating engine used for conditional logic and output generation |

## Configuration
The mapping of codes to categories is hardcoded in the template. If these mappings need to change, the template itself would need to be modified.

| Code | Category |
|:-----|:---------|
| 416098002 | medication |
| 59037007 | medication |
| 419511003 | medication |
| 414285001 | food |
| 232347008 | environment |
| 420134006 | other |
| 418038007 | other |
| 419199007 | other |

Note: The specific meanings of these codes are not provided in the template and would require reference to the relevant coding system (likely SNOMED CT based on the code format) for full understanding.
