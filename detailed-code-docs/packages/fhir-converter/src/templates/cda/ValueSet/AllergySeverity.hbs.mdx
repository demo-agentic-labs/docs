## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for allergy severity levels from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It translates various severity descriptions into standardized FHIR severity levels.

### Conditional Statements
#### Description
The template uses a series of conditional statements to map different severity descriptions to FHIR-compliant severity levels.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sev | string | The severity description from the CDA document |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| severity | string | The FHIR-compliant severity level |

#### Internal Logic
1. The input severity (`sev`) is converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
2. The template checks for specific severity descriptions and maps them to FHIR severity levels:
   - "fatal" is mapped to "severe"
   - "moderate to severe" or "severe" are mapped to "severe"
   - "mild to moderate" or "moderate" are mapped to "moderate"
   - "mild" is mapped to "mild"
3. If the input severity doesn't match any of these conditions, no output is generated (treated as unknown).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for conditional logic and output generation |

## Notes
1. The template includes a reference to the FHIR R4 ValueSet for reaction event severity: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-reaction-event-severity.html
2. There's a note indicating that if a severity cannot be mapped, it should be treated as unknown and omitted from the output.
3. The template uses helper functions like `eq`, `toLower`, and `or`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the Handlebars configuration.

This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format, focusing specifically on translating allergy severity information.
