## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for composition status codes between different standards, likely from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). It translates various status codes to their corresponding FHIR CompositionStatus values.

### Main Template
#### Description
The template consists of a series of conditional statements that map input status codes to FHIR CompositionStatus values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The input status code to be mapped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | string | The corresponding FHIR CompositionStatus value |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses a series of `{{#if}}` and `{{else if}}` statements to check the input `code` against various possible values. For each match, it outputs the corresponding FHIR CompositionStatus as a string. The mapping is as follows:

1. 'draft' or 'preliminary' → "preliminary"
2. 'final' or 'completed' → "final"
3. 'amended' or 'replaced' → "amended"
4. 'entered-in-error' or 'error' → "entered-in-error"
5. Any other value → "preliminary" (default case)

## Error Handling
The template includes a default case that returns "preliminary" for any unrecognized input code, effectively handling potential errors or unexpected inputs.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for its functionality.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The mapping is hardcoded within the template logic.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The mapping appears to be designed to convert various document status codes to the specific set of status values defined in the FHIR CompositionStatus value set.
3. Some mappings combine multiple input statuses into a single FHIR status, such as 'draft' and 'preliminary' both mapping to "preliminary" in FHIR.
