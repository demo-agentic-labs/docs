## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for diagnostic report status codes. It translates various input status codes to their corresponding FHIR DiagnosticReport status values, ensuring consistency and standardization in the representation of diagnostic report statuses.

### Main Template
#### Description
The template uses a series of conditional statements to map input status codes to standardized FHIR DiagnosticReport status values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The input status code to be mapped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | string | The mapped FHIR DiagnosticReport status value |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses a series of `{{#if}}` and `{{else if}}` statements to check the input `code` against various possible values. Each condition maps a specific input code to its corresponding FHIR DiagnosticReport status. If no match is found, it defaults to "unknown".

Key mappings include:
- "registered" and "received" map to "registered"
- "preliminary" maps to "preliminary"
- "final" and "completed" map to "final"
- "amended" maps to "amended"
- "corrected" maps to "corrected"
- "appended" maps to "appended"
- "cancelled" and "abandoned" map to "cancelled"
- "entered-in-error" and "error" map to "entered-in-error"
- "unknown" and any unmatched code map to "unknown"

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for its functionality.

## Error Handling
The template doesn't implement explicit error handling. Instead, it uses a default case ("unknown") for any unrecognized or undefined input codes.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template assumes that the input `code` is a string and performs case-sensitive comparisons.
3. Some input codes are mapped to the same output status (e.g., "registered" and "received" both map to "registered"), indicating a normalization of statuses in the FHIR representation.
