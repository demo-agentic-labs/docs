## High-level description
This Handlebars template file is designed to map immunization status codes from a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) immunization status codes. It provides a standardized way to convert various immunization status representations to a consistent FHIR format.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template uses a series of conditional statements to map input codes to FHIR immunization status codes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The input immunization status code from CDA |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | string | The corresponding FHIR immunization status code |

#### Internal Logic
1. The input `code` is converted to lowercase using the `toLower` helper function.
2. A series of `if-else` statements check the normalized code against known values.
3. If a match is found, the corresponding FHIR status code is returned.
4. If no match is found, the normalized code is returned as-is.

The mapping logic is as follows:
- "complete" or "active" → "completed"
- "abandoned", "cancelled", "held", "not administered", "aborted", "new", "obsolete", or "suspended" → "not-done"
- "nullified" or "error" → "entered-in-error"
- "normal" → "completed"
- Any other value is returned unchanged

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine and its built-in helpers like `if`, `else`, and `with`. It also uses a custom `toLower` helper function, which is not defined in this file but is assumed to be available in the Handlebars environment.

## References
The template includes references to two important resources:
1. HL7 CCDA on FHIR Implementation Guide: https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ccda-on-fhir/branches/master/ConceptMap-FC-ImmunizationStatus.html
2. FHIR R4 Immunization Status Value Set: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-immunization-status.html

These references provide the basis for the mapping logic implemented in this template.

## Error Handling
The template does not implement explicit error handling. If an unknown status code is provided, it will be returned as-is, which may or may not be a valid FHIR immunization status code.

## Performance Considerations
The template uses a simple if-else structure for mapping, which is efficient for a small number of possible values. However, if the number of possible input codes grows significantly, a more efficient lookup method (e.g., a hash table) might be considered for better performance.
