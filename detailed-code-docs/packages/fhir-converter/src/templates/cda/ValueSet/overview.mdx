## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of Handlebars template files that define mappings for various healthcare-related codes and statuses. These templates are part of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) converter project, specifically designed to translate CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) codes and statuses to their FHIR equivalents.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory provide standardized mappings for various healthcare data elements, including:

1. Address use codes
2. Administrative gender codes
3. Allergy categories, severities, and statuses
4. Composition statuses
5. Diagnostic report statuses
6. Encounter statuses
7. Event statuses
8. Financial Management (FM) statuses
9. Identifier types
10. Language codes
11. Medication administration, request, and statement statuses
12. Name use codes
13. Observation statuses
14. Request statuses
15. System references (OID to FHIR URL mappings)
16. Telecom use codes

These mappings ensure that data from CDA documents can be accurately translated into FHIR-compliant formats, maintaining consistency and interoperability across different healthcare information systems.

## Key Files
1. `AddressUse.hbs`: Maps address use codes.
2. `AdministrativeGender.hbs`: Translates gender codes.
3. `AllergyCategory.hbs`, `AllergySeverity.hbs`, `AllergyStatus.hbs`: Handle various aspects of allergy information.
4. `CompositionStatus.hbs`: Maps document composition statuses.
5. `DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs`: Translates diagnostic report statuses.
6. `EncounterStatus.hbs`: Maps encounter statuses.
7. `EventStatus.hbs`: Handles general event statuses.
8. `FMStatus.hbs`: Deals with Financial Management statuses.
9. `IdentifierType.hbs`: Maps identifier types based on OID codes.
10. `Language.hbs`: Translates language codes to full language names.
11. `MedicationAdministrationStatus.hbs`, `MedicationRequestStatus.hbs`, `MedicationStatementStatus.hbs`: Handle various medication-related statuses.
12. `NameUse.hbs`: Maps name use codes.
13. `ObservationStatus.hbs`: Translates observation statuses.
14. `RequestStatus.hbs`: Handles general request statuses.
15. `SystemReference.hbs`: Maps OID codes to FHIR system reference URLs.
16. `TelecomUse.hbs`: Translates telecom use codes.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for their functionality. They often use custom helper functions like `toLower` for case-insensitive comparisons.

## Configuration
Most templates don't have explicit configuration options. The mappings are typically hardcoded within each template based on established standards and guidelines, such as the HL7 CCDA on FHIR Implementation Guide and FHIR R4 specifications.

## Error Handling
Error handling in these templates is generally implicit. Most templates include a default case that maps any unrecognized input to a safe default value (often "unknown" or equivalent) to ensure that the templates always produce valid FHIR-compliant output.

This approach to error handling ensures robustness in the face of unexpected inputs, which is crucial when dealing with varied data sources in healthcare information systems.
