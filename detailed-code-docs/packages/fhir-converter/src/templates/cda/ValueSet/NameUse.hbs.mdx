## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for name usage codes in the context of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) conversion. It translates specific CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) name use codes to their corresponding FHIR name use codes.

## Symbols

### Conditional Statements
#### Description
The template uses Handlebars conditional statements to map CDA name use codes to FHIR name use codes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The CDA name use code to be translated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The corresponding FHIR name use code |

#### Internal Logic
The template checks the input `code` against three possible values:
1. If the code is 'C', it outputs "usual"
2. If the code is 'L', it outputs "usual"
3. If the code is 'P', it outputs "nickname"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for conditional logic |

## Notes
1. The template is part of a FHIR converter, specifically for translating CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The mapping is not exhaustive and only covers three specific CDA codes.
3. Both 'C' and 'L' codes are mapped to "usual" in FHIR, which might indicate that these codes have similar meanings in the CDA context.
4. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
