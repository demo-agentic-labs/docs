## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for event status codes in the context of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) R4 standard. It converts various input status codes to their corresponding FHIR R4 event status values, ensuring consistency and standardization in the representation of event statuses.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template uses a series of conditional statements to map input status codes to FHIR R4 event status values. It first converts the input code to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The input status code to be mapped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | string | The mapped FHIR R4 event status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Convert the input code to lowercase using the `toLower` helper.
2. Use a series of `if`/`else if` statements to check the normalized code against various status values.
3. Return the corresponding FHIR R4 event status for each matched input.
4. If no match is found, return "unknown" as the default status.

The mapping logic is as follows:
- "preparation" or "planned" → "preparation"
- "active" or "in-progress" → "in-progress"
- "abandonded", "cancelled", or "not-done" → "not-done"
- "suspended" or "on-hold" → "on-hold"
- "failed" or "stopped" → "stopped"
- "completed" or "complete" → "completed"
- "entered-in-error" or "error" → "entered-in-error"
- "unknown" or any unmatched value → "unknown"

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for its functionality.

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive a `code` value and returns a standardized FHIR R4 event status string.

| Input | Output | Description |
|:------|:-------|:------------|
| code (string) | FHIR R4 event status (string) | Maps various input status codes to standardized FHIR R4 event status values |

Note: The template includes a reference to the FHIR R4 ValueSet for event status (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-event-status.html) in a comment, indicating that the mapping is based on this standard.
