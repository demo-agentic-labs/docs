## High-level description
This Handlebars template file is designed to map medication statement status codes from a source format (likely CDA) to the FHIR R4 MedicationStatement status codes. It provides a standardized way to convert various status codes to the appropriate FHIR status, ensuring consistency in medication statement status representation.

### Main Template Logic
#### Description
The template takes an input `code` and maps it to the corresponding FHIR MedicationStatement status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The input status code to be mapped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | string | The mapped FHIR MedicationStatement status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if a `code` is provided.
2. If provided, convert the code to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
3. Use a series of conditional statements to map the normalized code to the appropriate FHIR status:
   - "aborted", "discontinued", "stopped", "failed" map to "stopped"
   - "in-progress", "active", "not-done" map to "active"
   - "entered-in-error", "error", "nullified" map to "entered-in-error"
   - "on-hold", "suspended" map to "on-hold"
   - "complete", "completed" map to "completed"
   - Any other value maps to "unknown"
4. If no code is provided or the code is an empty string, return "unknown"

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for its functionality.

## Configuration
The template doesn't have any explicit configuration options. The mapping is hardcoded based on the ConceptMap defined in the HL7 CCDA on FHIR implementation guide.

## Error Handling
The template handles potential errors by defaulting to "unknown" status in cases where:
- No code is provided
- The provided code is an empty string
- The provided code doesn't match any of the defined mappings

This approach ensures that the template always produces a valid FHIR MedicationStatement status, even with unexpected input.
