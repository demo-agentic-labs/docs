title: "AddressUse.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a mapping for address use codes in the context of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) conversion. It translates specific address use codes from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to their corresponding FHIR address use values.

### Main Template
#### Description
The template uses a series of conditional statements to map CDA address use codes to FHIR address use values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The CDA address use code to be mapped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The corresponding FHIR address use value |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses a series of `{{#if}}` and `{{else if}}` statements to check the input `code` against known CDA address use codes. For each match, it outputs the corresponding FHIR address use value:

1. If `code` is 'HP' or 'H', it outputs "home"
2. If `code` is 'WP', it outputs "work"
3. If `code` is 'TMP', it outputs "temp"
4. If `code` is 'BAD', it outputs "old"
5. If `code` has any other value (but is not empty), it outputs "temp"

If `code` is empty or undefined, no output is produced.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for its functionality.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement explicit error handling. If an unknown code is provided, it defaults to "temp".

## API/Interface Reference
| Input Code | Output Value |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| 'HP' | "home" |
| 'H' | "home" |
| 'WP' | "work" |
| 'TMP' | "temp" |
| 'BAD' | "old" |
| Any other non-empty value | "temp" |
| Empty or undefined | No output |

This template serves as a mapping function between CDA address use codes and FHIR address use values, which is crucial for maintaining data consistency when converting between these two healthcare data standards.
