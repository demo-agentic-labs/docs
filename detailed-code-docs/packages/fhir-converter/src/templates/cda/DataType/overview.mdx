## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for converting various data types from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically handling the transformation of common healthcare data structures.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory perform the following key functions:

1. Convert address information from CDA to FHIR format, including handling of street addresses, cities, states, and postal codes.
2. Transform age data into FHIR-compliant Age objects with appropriate units and codes.
3. Generate FHIR CodeableConcept and Coding objects from CDA coded entries, handling translations and unknown values.
4. Convert contact point information (phone numbers and email addresses) to FHIR ContactPoint resources.
5. Transform human name data from CDA to FHIR HumanName format, including given names, family names, prefixes, and suffixes.
6. Convert CDA identifiers to FHIR Identifier resources, handling different scenarios based on the presence of extensions and root values.
7. Format period data (start and end dates) into FHIR-compliant Period objects.
8. Transform quantity data, including handling of different units (e.g., feet and inches to centimeters) and comparators, into FHIR Quantity resources.
9. Convert range data from CDA to FHIR Range format.

These conversions ensure that data from CDA documents can be accurately represented in FHIR format, maintaining the original information while adhering to FHIR standards and structures.

## Key Files
1. **Address.hbs**: Converts CDA address data to FHIR format, handling various address components.
2. **Age.hbs**: Transforms age data into FHIR Age objects with appropriate units.
3. **CodeableConcept.hbs** and **Coding.hbs**: Handle the conversion of coded concepts from CDA to FHIR format.
4. **ContactPoint.hbs**: Converts phone numbers and email addresses to FHIR ContactPoint resources.
5. **HumanName.hbs**: Transforms CDA name data into FHIR HumanName format.
6. **Identifier.hbs**: Converts CDA identifiers to FHIR Identifier resources.
7. **Period.hbs**: Formats period data (start and end dates) into FHIR-compliant objects.
8. **Quantity.hbs** and **SimpleQuantity.hbs**: Handle the conversion of quantity data, including unit conversions and comparators.
9. **Range.hbs**: Converts CDA range data to FHIR Range format.

Each of these files plays a crucial role in the overall conversion process, ensuring that specific data types are accurately transformed from CDA to FHIR format.

## Dependencies
The templates in this directory rely on several external dependencies and helper functions:

1. Handlebars: The templating engine used for generating the JSON output.
2. Custom helper functions: Such as `parseReferenceData`, `toArray`, `decodeHtmlEntities`, `convertFeetAndInchesToCm`, `extractComparator`, `extractNumberAndUnit`, and `extractDecimal`.
3. Partial templates: Including `ValueSet/AddressUse.hbs`, `ValueSet/TelecomUse.hbs`, `ValueSet/NameUse.hbs`, `ValueSet/SystemReference.hbs`, and `ValueSet/IdentifierType.hbs`.

These dependencies provide essential functionality for data parsing, formatting, and specific value set mappings required for accurate CDA to FHIR conversion.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, several templates use fixed configurations or standard references:

1. The `system` property in quantity-related templates is set to "http://unitsofmeasure.org", adhering to FHIR standards for units of measure.
2. The `Identifier.hbs` template uses "http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-Unknown" as a default system for unknown values.
3. Some templates, like `Address.hbs`, use flags such as `isOrg` to determine specific formatting rules.

These configurations ensure consistency in the output and compliance with FHIR standards across different data type conversions.
