## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for converting a human name from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It creates a JSON object representing a person's name with various components such as use, family name, given names, full text, prefixes, and suffixes.

### HumanName.hbs
#### Description
This Handlebars template generates a JSON object representing a human name in FHIR format. It extracts information from the CDA `name` object and maps it to the corresponding FHIR HumanName fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | Object | The CDA name object containing various name components |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | Object | A FHIR-compliant HumanName object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `use` field by calling the `NameUse.hbs` partial template with `name.use` as the code.
2. Sets the `family` field from `name.family._`.
3. Creates an array of `given` names by iterating over `name.given` using the `toArray` helper.
4. Sets the `text` field from `name._`.
5. Creates `prefix` and `suffix` arrays with single elements from `name.prefix._` and `name.suffix._` respectively.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ValueSet/NameUse.hbs | Partial template for converting the name use code |

## Notes
- The template uses Handlebars syntax, including helpers like `#each` and `toArray`.
- The `{{!-- --}}` block at the beginning contains copyright and license information, indicating that this file incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3.
- The template assumes that the input `name` object follows the CDA structure, with properties like `use`, `family`, `given`, `prefix`, and `suffix`.
- Some fields (like `prefix` and `suffix`) are always created as arrays, even if they contain only one element.
- The `text` field is set to the entire name string (`name._`), which might not always be available or accurate in all CDA documents.
