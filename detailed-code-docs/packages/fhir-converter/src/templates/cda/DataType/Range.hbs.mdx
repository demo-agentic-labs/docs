## High-level description
This Handlebars template file, `Range.hbs`, is designed to convert a range object from a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format to a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Range data type. It extracts the low and high values of the range and formats them using the SimpleQuantity template.

## Symbols

### Range.hbs
#### Description
This is the main template for converting a CDA range object to a FHIR Range data type. It uses the `extractReferenceRange` helper function to process the input range and then applies the SimpleQuantity template to format the low and high values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| range | Object | The input range object from the CDA format |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Object | A FHIR Range data type object with 'low' and 'high' properties |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses the `extractReferenceRange` helper function to process the input `range` object.
2. It then creates a JSON object with two properties: 'low' and 'high'.
3. For both 'low' and 'high' properties, it applies the `SimpleQuantity.hbs` partial template, passing the respective values from the processed range object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| DataType/SimpleQuantity.hbs | Used to format the low and high values of the range |

## References
- The template references the `SimpleQuantity.hbs` partial template, which is likely defined in another file in the same directory structure.
- It also uses the `extractReferenceRange` helper function, which is not defined in this file and is likely provided by the Handlebars environment or a custom helper.
