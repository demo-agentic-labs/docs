### Period Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object representing a period with start and/or end dates. It uses conditional logic to handle different combinations of available date information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| period | Object | An object containing period information, potentially including `low`, `high`, and `value` properties |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object with `start` and/or `end` properties, representing the period |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if both `period.low` and `period.high` exist and if the start date is less than or equal to the end date.
   - If true, output both `start` and `end` dates.
2. If both dates exist but start date is greater than end date, only output the `start` date.
3. If only `period.low` exists, output it as the `start` date.
4. If only `period.high` exists, output it as the `end` date.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, use `period.value` as the `start` date.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| formatAsDateTime | Helper function to format date values |
| startDateLteEndDate | Helper function to compare start and end dates |

Note: These helper functions are not defined in this file but are assumed to be available in the Handlebars environment.

## Error Handling
The template includes implicit error handling through its conditional structure. It gracefully handles cases where expected date information might be missing or invalid.
