## High-level description
This Handlebars template file, `Age.hbs`, is designed to format age data in a structured JSON format compatible with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards. It transforms input data about an age quantity into a standardized object with value, unit, system, and code properties.

### Age Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing an age measurement. It uses input data to populate the object's properties, ensuring compatibility with FHIR data standards.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| quantity.value | Number | The numeric value of the age |
| quantity.unit | String | The unit of measurement for the age (e.g., "years", "months") |
| quantity.code | String | The code representing the unit of measurement |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured object representing the age with value, unit, system, and code properties |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with four properties:
   - `value`: Directly uses the input `quantity.value`
   - `unit`: Directly uses the input `quantity.unit`
   - `system`: Hard-coded to "http://unitsofmeasure.org", which is the standard system for units of measure in FHIR
   - `code`: Uses a conditional statement to set the code
     - If `quantity.code` is provided, it uses that value
     - If `quantity.code` is not provided, it defaults to "unknown"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used to generate the JSON output |

## Configuration
The template uses a fixed configuration for the `system` property:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| system | String | "http://unitsofmeasure.org" | The standard system for units of measure in FHIR |

## Notes
- This template is part of a FHIR converter, specifically for handling CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversions.
- The use of "http://unitsofmeasure.org" as the system indicates compliance with the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM).
- The template handles cases where the code for the unit of measure might not be provided by defaulting to "unknown".
