## High-level description
This Handlebars template file, `CodeableConcept.hbs`, is designed to generate a FHIR CodeableConcept data type from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data. It structures the output as a JSON object containing a "text" field and a "coding" array, which includes one or more Coding objects.

### CodeableConcept Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR CodeableConcept, which is used to represent coded concepts in healthcare.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | Object | The main code object containing originalText and possibly translation |
| text | String | An alternative text representation |
| canBeUnknown | Boolean | Flag to indicate if the concept can be marked as "unknown" |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR CodeableConcept representation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the "text" field:
   - If `code.originalText` exists, use it
   - Else if `text` exists, use it
   - Else if `canBeUnknown` is true, set to "unknown"
2. Creates a "coding" array:
   - Includes the main code using the Coding.hbs partial
   - Iterates over `code.translation` array (if it exists) and includes each translation using the Coding.hbs partial

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |
| DataType/Coding.hbs | Partial template for generating Coding objects |

## Helper Functions
| Function | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| parseReferenceData | Used to parse and format the text content |
| toArray | Converts input to an array, likely used for handling single or multiple translations |

## Notes
- The template uses triple curly braces `{{{...}}}` for the `parseReferenceData` helper, which suggests that HTML escaping is disabled for these values.
- The template is designed to handle cases where the concept can be marked as "unknown" if no other text is available.
- The coding array can include multiple entries: the main code and any translations.

This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources, specifically handling the conversion of coded concepts.
