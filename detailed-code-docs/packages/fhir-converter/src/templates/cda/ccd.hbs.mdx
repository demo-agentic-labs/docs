## High-level description
This Handlebars template file (ccd.hbs) defines the structure of a FHIR Bundle resource of type "batch". It includes various sections of a Continuity of Care Document (CCD), each represented by a partial template. The file serves as the main template for generating a comprehensive CCD document in FHIR format.

## Code Structure
The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR Bundle resource. It includes multiple partial templates, each representing a different section of the CCD document. These partials are included using the Handlebars syntax `{{&gt;PartialName.hbs}}`.

### Bundle Resource
#### Description
The main structure of the template, representing a FHIR Bundle resource of type "batch".

#### Internal Logic
The template includes various sections of a CCD document, each represented by a partial template. These sections cover different aspects of patient care, such as allergies, medications, procedures, and vital signs.

## Dependencies
This template relies on multiple partial Handlebars templates, each representing a different section of the CCD document. These partials are not shown in the provided code but are referenced using the `{{&gt;PartialName.hbs}}` syntax.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out section at the end of the template:
```handlebars
{{! Document Resource Creation }}
{{!-- Document Reference commented out --}}
```
This suggests that there might be a plan to include a Document Reference resource in the future, but it is currently not implemented.

## Additional Notes
1. The file includes a detailed copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3.

2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for the inclusion or exclusion of various sections based on the available data.

3. The order of the sections in the template may be significant, possibly reflecting a standard structure for CCD documents.

4. The template does not include any conditional logic or data manipulation, suggesting that the data processing and decision-making about which sections to include might be handled elsewhere in the application.

5. The use of Handlebars partials allows for modular development and maintenance of the CCD template, with each section potentially being developed and updated independently.
