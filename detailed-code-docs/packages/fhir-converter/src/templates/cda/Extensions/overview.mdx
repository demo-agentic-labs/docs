## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR extensions related to patient demographics, specifically focusing on Ethnicity and Race. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR-compliant formats.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory perform the following key functions:

1. Ethnicity Conversion: Transforms CDA ethnicity data into a FHIR extension object that complies with the US Core Implementation Guide for ethnicity. It handles various scenarios such as multiple ethnicities, unknown values, and specific ethnicity codes.

2. Race Conversion: Converts CDA race information into a FHIR extension object that adheres to the US Core Race extension format. It processes both standard Office of Management and Budget (OMB) race categories and detailed race codes.

Both templates are designed to handle complex scenarios, including multiple values, null flavors (unknown or unanswered), and the distinction between high-level categories and detailed codes.

## Key Files

1. Ethnicity.hbs
   - Purpose: Generates a FHIR extension for ethnicity information.
   - Key features:
     - Handles multiple ethnicities
     - Distinguishes between OMB categories and detailed ethnicity codes
     - Provides text representation of ethnicities
     - Manages null flavors (unknown or asked but no answer)

2. Race.hbs
   - Purpose: Creates a FHIR extension for race information.
   - Key features:
     - Processes multiple race codes
     - Differentiates between OMB race categories and detailed race codes
     - Generates text representation of races
     - Handles null flavors

Both templates use a partial template (`DataType/Coding.hbs`) to generate FHIR Coding datatypes, ensuring consistency in the output format.

## Dependencies
Both templates rely on the `DataType/Coding.hbs` partial template for generating FHIR Coding datatype objects. This dependency is crucial for maintaining consistency in the structure of coded values across different extensions.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, both templates use predefined codes to identify specific categories:

1. Ethnicity.hbs:
   - OMB Category Codes: '2135-2', '2186-5' (Used to determine if a code represents an OMB ethnicity category)

2. Race.hbs:
   - OMB Category Codes: (Not explicitly listed in the summary, but likely used similarly to ethnicity)

These codes are hardcoded into the templates and serve as configuration parameters for categorizing input data.

The templates are designed to work with specific input structures, expecting a `patient` object with properties like `ethnicGroupCode`, `raceCode`, and their `sdtc` counterparts for additional codes.

Output from both templates conforms to the respective US Core StructureDefinitions:
- Ethnicity: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-ethnicity
- Race: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race

These templates play a crucial role in ensuring that patient demographic data is accurately transformed from CDA format to FHIR, maintaining compliance with US Core profiles and handling the complexities of real-world data scenarios.
