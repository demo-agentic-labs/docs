## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to process and transform Consolidated CDA (C-CDA) encounter data into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It generates FHIR resources for Encounters, Practitioners, Organizations, Locations, and Conditions, along with their respective references.

## Code Structure
The template uses nested Handlebars helpers and partials to iterate through CDA encounter entries and generate corresponding FHIR resources. It also creates references between these resources to maintain the relationships present in the original CDA data.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template processes CDA encounter data and generates FHIR resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves reason for visit codes using the `Utils/ReasonForVisit.hbs` partial.
2. Checks for the presence of encounter sections in the CDA document.
3. Iterates through encounter entries to generate FHIR resources:
   - Encounter
   - Practitioner (if present)
   - Organization (if present)
   - Location (if present)
   - Condition (if present)
4. Creates references between resources to maintain relationships.

### Handlebars Helpers and Partials
#### Description
The template uses various Handlebars helpers and partials to process data and generate FHIR resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| msg | Object | The input CDA message containing encounter data |

#### Outputs
FHIR resources and references in JSON format.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Utils/ReasonForVisit.hbs | Retrieves reason for visit codes |
| Utils/GeneratePatientId.hbs | Generates a patient ID |
| Utils/GeneratePractitionerId.hbs | Generates a practitioner ID |
| Utils/GenerateOrganizationId.hbs | Generates an organization ID |
| Utils/GenerateLocationId.hbs | Generates a location ID |
| Resources/Encounter.hbs | Generates FHIR Encounter resource |
| Resources/Practitioner.hbs | Generates FHIR Practitioner resource |
| Resources/Organization.hbs | Generates FHIR Organization resource |
| Resources/Location.hbs | Generates FHIR Location resource |
| Resources/Condition.hbs | Generates FHIR Condition resource |
| Various References/*.hbs | Generates references between FHIR resources |

## Error Handling
The template uses conditional statements to check for the presence of data before processing, which helps prevent errors when optional elements are missing.

## Performance Considerations
The template processes potentially large datasets with nested loops, which could impact performance for very large CDA documents. Care should be taken to optimize the data processing if performance issues arise with large inputs.
