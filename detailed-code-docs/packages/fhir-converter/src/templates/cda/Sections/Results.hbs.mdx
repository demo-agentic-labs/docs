title: "Results.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to convert Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) Results sections into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It specifically handles the conversion of diagnostic reports, observations, and related resources such as practitioners and organizations.

## Code Structure
The template is structured around conditional blocks that process different parts of the CDA Results section. It generates FHIR resources for DiagnosticReport, Observation, Practitioner, and Organization, along with their respective references.

## Symbols

### Main Conditional Block
#### Description
The main conditional block checks if the CDA document contains a Results section with specific template IDs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the presence of specific template IDs in the CDA document.
2. If found, it processes the entries in the Results section.

### DiagnosticReport Generation
#### Description
Generates a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource from the CDA organizer entry.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `DiagnosticReport.hbs` partial to create the resource.
2. Generates references to the subject (patient) and encounter if available.

### Practitioner and Organization Generation
#### Description
Creates FHIR Practitioner and Organization resources based on the performer information in the CDA document.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates Practitioner resources using the `Practitioner.hbs` partial.
2. Creates Organization resources if represented organization information is available.
3. Establishes references between DiagnosticReport and Practitioner/Organization.

### Observation Generation
#### Description
Processes each observation within the organizer component and creates FHIR Observation resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each observation in the component array.
2. Creates Observation resources using the `Observation.hbs` partial.
3. Establishes references between DiagnosticReport and Observation.
4. Creates references to the subject (patient) for each Observation.
5. Handles performer information for Observations, using either observation-specific or top-level performer data.

## Dependencies
The template relies on several partial templates and helper functions:
- Partials: `Resources/DiagnosticReport.hbs`, `References/DiagnosticReport/subject.hbs`, `Resources/Practitioner.hbs`, `Resources/Organization.hbs`, `Resources/Observation.hbs`, various reference partials
- Helpers: `contains`, `toString`, `toJsonString`, `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`, `coalesce`, `multipleToArray`, `generateUUID`, `evaluate`, `toArray`

## Error Handling
The template uses conditional checks to handle potential missing data, ensuring that resources are only created when the necessary information is available.

## Notes
- The template includes a TODO comment indicating that handling for `obsEntry.procedure` might be missing and needs to be addressed in future updates.
- The template uses a mix of CDA-specific identifiers and FHIR resource types, demonstrating the mapping between the two standards.
