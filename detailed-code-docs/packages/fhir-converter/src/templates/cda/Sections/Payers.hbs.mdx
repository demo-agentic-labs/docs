## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to process and transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) payer information into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Coverage and Organization resources. It extracts payer data from specific CDA sections and generates corresponding FHIR resources, including references between them.

## Code Structure
The template is structured around conditional blocks that check for the presence of specific CDA template IDs and iterate through payer entries. It then generates FHIR resources based on the extracted data, including Coverage, Organization, and their respective references.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template processes the CDA payer section and generates FHIR resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the presence of the CDA template ID '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.18'.
2. Iterates through payer entries in the CDA document.
3. For each payer entry:
   - Generates a Coverage resource.
   - Processes performer entries to create Organization resources and references.
   - Creates references for Coverage.payor and Coverage.beneficiary.

### Partial Templates
The template uses several partial templates for generating specific FHIR resources and references:

1. `Resources/Coverage.hbs`
2. `Resources/Organization.hbs`
3. `References/Coverage/payor.hbs`
4. `References/Coverage/beneficiary.hbs`

These partials are called with specific context and data to generate the corresponding FHIR resource or reference.

### Helper Functions
The template uses several helper functions:

- `contains`: Checks if a string contains a specific substring.
- `toString`: Converts a value to a string.
- `toJsonString`: Converts a value to a JSON string.
- `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`: Retrieves the first CDA section with a specific template ID.
- `toArray`: Converts a value to an array.
- `generateUUID`: Generates a UUID based on input data.
- `evaluate`: Evaluates another Handlebars template with given context.

## Dependencies
This template relies on other Handlebars templates and helper functions, which are not directly visible in this file but are referenced and used throughout the template.

## Configuration
The template uses specific CDA template IDs and FHIR resource types, which can be considered as configuration:

- CDA Template ID: '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.18' (Payers section)
- FHIR Resource Types: Coverage, Organization
- CDA Performer Template IDs: 
  - '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.87' (Payer Performer)
  - '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.88' (Guarantor Performer)
  - '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.89' (Covered Party Participant)
  - '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.90' (Policy Holder Participant)

## Error Handling
The template includes some error handling through conditional checks, such as verifying the existence of certain data before attempting to process it. For example, it checks if the performer entry contains a specific template ID before processing it as a payer performer.
