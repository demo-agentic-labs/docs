## High-level description
This Handlebars template file, `Social_History.hbs`, is designed to process and transform social history data from a Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Observation resources. It specifically handles social history sections identified by the template ID '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.17'.

## Code Structure
The template uses nested Handlebars helpers to iterate through the social history entries, generate Observation resources, and create references to related resources such as Patient, Practitioner, and Organization.

## Symbols

### Root Template
#### Description
The root template checks for the presence of a specific social history section and processes its entries.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the message contains the social history template ID.
2. If found, it retrieves the first CDA section with that template ID.
3. Iterates through each entry in the social history section.
4. For each entry, it generates an Observation resource and associated references.

### Observation Resource Generation
#### Description
Generates an Observation resource for each social history entry.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `Resources/Observation.hbs` partial to create the Observation resource.
2. Sets the observation category to "social-history".
3. Generates a unique ID for the Observation using UUID.

### Patient Reference
#### Description
Creates a reference to the Patient resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `Utils/GeneratePatientId.hbs` partial to generate a patient ID.
2. Creates a reference to the Patient using the `References/Observation/subject.hbs` partial.

### Practitioner and Organization References
#### Description
Creates references to Practitioner and Organization resources if author information is available.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each author in the observation entry.
2. For Practitioners:
   - Generates a Practitioner ID using `Utils/GeneratePractitionerId.hbs`.
   - Creates a Practitioner resource using `Resources/Practitioner.hbs`.
   - Adds a reference to the Practitioner using `References/Observation/performer.hbs`.
3. For Organizations:
   - Generates an Organization ID using `Utils/GenerateOrganizationId.hbs`.
   - Creates an Organization resource using `Resources/Organization.hbs`.
   - Adds a reference to the Organization using `References/Observation/performer.hbs`.

## Dependencies
