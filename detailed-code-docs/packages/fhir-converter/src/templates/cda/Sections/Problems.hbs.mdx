## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to process and transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data related to patient problems and conditions into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It handles both active problems and resolved problems, creating Condition resources and associated references.

## Code Structure
The template is divided into two main sections:
1. Processing active problems (template ID: 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.5)
2. Processing resolved problems (template ID: 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.20)

Each section extracts relevant data from the CDA structure and generates corresponding FHIR resources.

### Active Problems Section
#### Description
This section processes active problems from the CDA document and generates FHIR Condition resources along with associated references.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the CDA document contains the specified template ID for active problems.
2. Iterates through each problem entry.
3. For each problem:
   - Generates a Condition resource
   - Creates a subject reference linking to the patient
   - If author information is available, creates a Practitioner resource and a recorder reference

### Resolved Problems Section
#### Description
This section processes resolved problems from the CDA document and generates FHIR Condition resources along with associated references.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the CDA document contains the specified template ID for resolved problems.
2. Iterates through each resolved problem entry.
3. For each resolved problem:
   - Generates a Condition resource
   - Creates a subject reference linking to the patient
   - If author information is available, creates a Practitioner resource and a recorder reference

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Utils/GeneratePatientId.hbs | Generates a patient ID |
| Utils/GeneratePractitionerId.hbs | Generates a practitioner ID |
| Resources/Condition.hbs | Template for creating a Condition resource |
| Resources/Practitioner.hbs | Template for creating a Practitioner resource |
| References/Condition/subject.hbs | Template for creating a subject reference for a Condition |
| References/Condition/recorder.hbs | Template for creating a recorder reference for a Condition |

## Error Handling
The template uses conditional statements to check for the existence of required data before processing, which helps prevent errors when optional fields are missing.

## Notes
- The template uses custom Handlebars helpers like `contains`, `toString`, `toJsonString`, `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`, `multipleToArray`, `toArray`, `generateUUID`, and `evaluate`.
- The `@metriportPatientId` context variable is used to generate patient references, suggesting this template is part of a larger system where patient context is maintained.
