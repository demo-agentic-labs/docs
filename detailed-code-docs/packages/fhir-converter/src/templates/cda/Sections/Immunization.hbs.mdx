## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to process and transform immunization data from a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It extracts immunization information, creates corresponding FHIR resources (Immunization, Organization, Practitioner), and establishes the necessary references between these resources.

## Code Structure
The template is structured as a series of conditional blocks that check for the presence of specific data elements in the CDA input. It then uses partial templates to generate the corresponding FHIR resources and references.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template processes the immunization section of a CDA document and generates FHIR resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the CDA document contains the immunization section template ID.
2. Iterates through each immunization entry in the section.
3. For each entry:
   - Generates an Immunization resource
   - Checks for and generates Organization resources for facilities
   - Checks for and generates Practitioner resources for authors
   - Generates references between Immunization and Organization/Practitioner resources
   - Generates a reference to the Patient resource

## Dependencies
This template relies on several partial templates and helper functions:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Resources/Immunization.hbs | Generates FHIR Immunization resource |
| Resources/Organization.hbs | Generates FHIR Organization resource |
| Resources/Practitioner.hbs | Generates FHIR Practitioner resource |
| References/Immunization/performer.actor.hbs | Creates performer references for Immunization |
| References/Immunization/patient.hbs | Creates patient reference for Immunization |
| Utils/GenerateOrganizationId.hbs | Generates unique ID for Organization |
| Utils/GeneratePractitionerId.hbs | Generates unique ID for Practitioner |
| Utils/GeneratePatientId.hbs | Generates unique ID for Patient |

## Helper Functions
The template uses several custom helper functions:

| Function | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| contains | Checks if a string contains a substring |
| toString | Converts a value to a string |
| toJsonString | Converts a value to a JSON string |
| getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId | Retrieves CDA sections by template ID |
| multipleToArray | Converts multiple entries to an array |
| generateUUID | Generates a unique identifier |
| evaluate | Evaluates a partial template |

Note: The exact implementation of these helper functions is not provided in the given code snippet.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying Handlebars engine to handle any errors that may occur during template processing.

## Configuration
The template uses specific template IDs to identify the immunization section:
- '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.2'
- '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.2.1'

These IDs are hardcoded and used to locate the relevant sections in the CDA document.
