title: "Procedure_Anesthesia.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template file is designed to convert Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data related to procedures and anesthesia into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It processes procedure entries and substance administrations, generating corresponding FHIR resources such as Procedure, Organization, MedicationAdministration, and Medication.

## Code Structure
The template iterates through procedure entries in the CDA document, creating FHIR resources for procedures and medications. It also generates references between these resources and the patient. The code is structured to handle both procedure and substance administration entries separately.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template processes the CDA section with the template ID '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.25', which corresponds to the Procedures section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each entry in the procedures section.
2. For procedure entries:
   - Generates a Procedure resource
   - Creates a subject reference to the Patient
   - If an organization is present, creates an Organization resource and a performer reference
3. For substance administration entries:
   - Generates a MedicationAdministration resource
   - Creates a Medication resource
   - Creates subject and medication references

### Partial Templates
The main template uses several partial templates to generate specific parts of the FHIR resources:

1. `Resources/Procedure.hbs`
2. `References/Procedure/subject.hbs`
3. `Resources/Organization.hbs`
4. `References/Procedure/performer.actor.hbs`
5. `Resources/MedicationAdministration.hbs`
6. `Resources/Medication.hbs`
7. `References/MedicationAdministration/subject.hbs`
8. `References/MedicationAdministration/medicationReference.hbs`

These partial templates are responsible for generating the specific FHIR resources and references.

### Helper Functions
The template uses several helper functions:

1. `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`: Retrieves the first CDA section with the specified template ID.
2. `toArray`: Converts an object to an array.
3. `generateUUID`: Generates a unique identifier based on the input string.
4. `evaluate`: Evaluates another Handlebars template with the given context.

## Dependencies
This template relies on other Handlebars templates and helper functions, which are not directly visible in this file but are crucial for its functionality.

## Configuration
The template uses a configuration variable `@metriportPatientId` to generate patient references consistently across the conversion process.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the input CDA document is well-formed and contains the expected sections and entries.

## Performance Considerations
The template generates UUIDs for each resource, which could potentially impact performance if processing large documents with many entries. The use of partial templates may also affect rendering speed, depending on the complexity of those templates.
