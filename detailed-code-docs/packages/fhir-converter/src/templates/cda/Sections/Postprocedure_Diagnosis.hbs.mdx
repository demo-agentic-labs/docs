## High-level description
This Handlebars template file is designed to process and transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data related to post-procedure diagnoses into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It specifically handles the conversion of post-procedure diagnosis information from CDA to FHIR Condition resources.

## Symbols

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template iterates through post-procedure diagnosis entries in the CDA document and generates corresponding FHIR Condition resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the first CDA section with the template ID '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.36' (Post-procedure Diagnosis Section).
2. Iterates through each entry in the retrieved section.
3. For each entry, it further iterates through the entryRelationship array.
4. If an observation is present in the entryRelationship, it generates a FHIR Condition resource and a corresponding subject reference.

### Partial Templates
#### Description
The template uses two partial templates:
1. `Resources/Condition.hbs`: Generates the FHIR Condition resource.
2. `References/Condition/subject.hbs`: Generates the subject reference for the Condition resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditionEntry | Object | The observation data from the CDA document |
| ID | String | A generated UUID for the Condition resource |
| REF | String | A reference to the Patient resource |

### Helper Functions
#### Description
The template uses several helper functions:

1. `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`: Retrieves CDA sections by template ID.
2. `toArray`: Converts an object or array to an array.
3. `generateUUID`: Generates a UUID based on the input string.
4. `toJsonString`: Converts an object to a JSON string.
5. `evaluate`: Evaluates another Handlebars template.

## Dependencies
The template relies on other Handlebars templates and helper functions, which are not visible in this file but are crucial for its functionality.

## Configuration
The template uses a specific CDA template ID ('2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.36') to identify the Post-procedure Diagnosis Section.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the beginning, indicating its origins and licensing terms.
2. The template is designed to work within a larger FHIR conversion system, as evidenced by the use of partial templates and helper functions.
3. The generated FHIR resources include both the Condition resource and its subject reference, linking it to a Patient resource.
