## High-level description
This Handlebars template file is responsible for generating FHIR resources related to medical equipment from a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) document. It processes sections with the template ID '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.23', creating Device and Procedure resources as needed.

## Code Structure
The template uses conditional statements and loops to iterate through the CDA document's medical equipment entries. It then calls partial templates to generate the corresponding FHIR resources (Device, Procedure, and Organization) and their references.

## Symbols

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template checks for the presence of the medical equipment section and processes its entries.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the CDA document contains the medical equipment section template ID.
2. If present, iterate through each entry in the section.
3. For each entry, generate the appropriate FHIR resources based on the entry type (organizer, supply, or procedure).
4. Generate references between resources as needed.

### Partial Templates
#### Description
The template uses several partial templates to generate specific FHIR resources:

1. `Resources/Device2.hbs`: Generates Device resources
2. `Resources/Procedure.hbs`: Generates Procedure resources
3. `Resources/Organization.hbs`: Generates Organization resources
4. `References/Procedure/subject.hbs`: Generates subject references for Procedures
5. `References/Procedure/performer.actor.hbs`: Generates performer references for Procedures

#### Inputs
The partial templates receive specific parts of the CDA document as input, along with generated IDs.

#### Outputs
Each partial template generates a portion of the FHIR JSON representation for the respective resource.

| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating FHIR resources |

## Helper Functions
The template uses several custom Handlebars helper functions:

1. `contains`: Checks if a string contains a substring
2. `toString`: Converts a value to a string
3. `toJsonString`: Converts a value to a JSON string
4. `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`: Retrieves the first CDA section with a given template ID
5. `toArray`: Converts a value to an array
6. `generateUUID`: Generates a UUID based on input
7. `evaluate`: Evaluates another template with given parameters

These helper functions are likely defined elsewhere in the project and are crucial for the template's functionality.

## Error Handling
The template does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the Handlebars engine to handle any errors that may occur during template rendering.

## Performance Considerations
The template uses nested loops and conditional statements, which may impact performance for large CDA documents. However, this is likely necessary for the complex structure of CDA documents and the corresponding FHIR resource generation.
