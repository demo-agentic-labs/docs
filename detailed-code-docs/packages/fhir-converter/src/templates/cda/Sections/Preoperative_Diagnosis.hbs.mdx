title: "Preoperative_Diagnosis.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to convert Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format, specifically focusing on preoperative diagnosis information. It extracts relevant data from the CDA structure and generates corresponding FHIR Condition resources.

## Code Structure
The template uses nested Handlebars helpers and partials to navigate through the CDA structure, extract diagnosis information, and generate FHIR Condition resources along with their references.

## Symbols

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template iterates through the CDA structure to find preoperative diagnosis entries and converts them into FHIR Condition resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId` to locate the preoperative diagnosis section in the CDA document.
2. Iterates through the entries in the section.
3. For each entry, checks for observation data.
4. If observation data is present, it generates a Condition resource and a reference to the patient.

### Handlebars Helpers and Partials
#### Description
The template uses several Handlebars helpers and partials to process the data and generate FHIR resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| msg | object | The input CDA document |

#### Internal Logic
- `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`: Extracts sections from the CDA document based on a template ID.
- `toArray`: Ensures that the data is in array format for iteration.
- `generateUUID`: Generates a unique identifier for the Condition resource.
- `evaluate`: Evaluates another Handlebars template (used for generating patient ID).
- Partials:
  - `Resources/Condition.hbs`: Generates the Condition resource.
  - `References/Condition/subject.hbs`: Generates the subject reference for the Condition.

## Dependencies
The template relies on other Handlebars templates and helpers, which are not provided in the given code snippet. These include:
- `Utils/GeneratePatientId.hbs`
- `Resources/Condition.hbs`
- `References/Condition/subject.hbs`

## Configuration
The template uses a specific template ID to identify the preoperative diagnosis section:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| Template ID | string | 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.34 | Identifies the preoperative diagnosis section in the CDA document |

## Notes
1. The template assumes the existence of a `@metriportPatientId` context variable for patient identification.
2. The generated FHIR resources are formatted as comma-separated JSON objects, suggesting they are intended to be part of a larger FHIR Bundle.
3. Error handling and edge cases (e.g., missing data) are not explicitly addressed in this template.
