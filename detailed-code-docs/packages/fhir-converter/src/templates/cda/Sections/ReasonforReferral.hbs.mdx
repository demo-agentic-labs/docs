## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to generate FHIR resources for a "Reason for Referral" section in a Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) document. It processes referral entries, creating ServiceRequest, Practitioner, and Organization resources as needed, along with their respective references.

## Code Structure
The template uses nested Handlebars helpers and partials to iterate through referral entries and generate the appropriate FHIR resources. It relies on several helper functions and partial templates to create unique identifiers and format the output correctly.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template iterates through referral entries in the CDA document and generates corresponding FHIR resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the first CDA section with the template ID '1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.5.3.1.3.1'.
2. Iterates through each entry in the section.
3. For each entry:
   - Generates a ServiceRequest resource.
   - If an author is present, generates a Practitioner resource and its reference.
   - If a represented organization is present, generates an Organization resource and its reference.

### Handlebars Helpers
#### Description
The template uses several Handlebars helpers to process data and generate unique identifiers.

#### Inputs
- `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`: Retrieves CDA sections by template ID.
- `toArray`: Converts an object to an array.
- `generateUUID`: Generates a unique identifier based on input data.
- `toJsonString`: Converts an object to a JSON string.
- `evaluate`: Evaluates another Handlebars template with given context.

### Partial Templates
#### Description
The template uses several partial templates to generate specific FHIR resources and references.

#### Inputs
- `Resources/ServiceRequest.hbs`: Generates a ServiceRequest resource.
- `Resources/Practitioner.hbs`: Generates a Practitioner resource.
- `Resources/Organization.hbs`: Generates an Organization resource.
- `References/ServiceRequest/requester.hbs`: Generates a requester reference for a ServiceRequest.
- `Utils/GeneratePractitionerId.hbs`: Generates a unique identifier for a Practitioner.
- `Utils/GenerateOrganizationId.hbs`: Generates a unique identifier for an Organization.

## Dependencies
The template relies on various Handlebars helpers and partial templates, which are not directly visible in this file but are crucial for its functionality.

## Configuration
The template uses the CDA template ID '1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.5.3.1.3.1' to identify the relevant section in the CDA document.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the input data is correctly formatted and that all required helpers and partial templates are available.

## TODOs
