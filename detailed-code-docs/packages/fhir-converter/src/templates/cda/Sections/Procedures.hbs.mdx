## High-level description
This Handlebars template file is responsible for generating FHIR resources related to procedures and observations from a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) document. It processes sections of the CDA document that contain procedure and observation information, creating corresponding FHIR Procedure, Observation, Organization, and Practitioner resources.

## Code Structure
The template is structured as a series of conditional blocks and loops that extract data from the CDA document and use partial templates to generate FHIR resources. It handles both procedures and observations, creating references between resources as needed.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template processes CDA sections related to procedures and observations, generating FHIR resources for each entry.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the CDA document contains specific template IDs related to procedures.
2. Iterate through procedure and observation entries in the CDA document.
3. For each procedure entry:
   - Generate a Procedure resource
   - Create a subject reference to the Patient
   - If applicable, create Organization and Practitioner resources and link them to the Procedure
4. For each observation entry:
   - Generate an Observation resource
   - Create a subject reference to the Patient
   - If applicable, create Practitioner and Organization resources and link them to the Observation

## Dependencies
This template relies on several partial templates and helper functions:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Resources/Procedure.hbs | Generate Procedure resource |
| Resources/Organization.hbs | Generate Organization resource |
| Resources/Practitioner.hbs | Generate Practitioner resource |
| Resources/Observation.hbs | Generate Observation resource |
| References/*.hbs | Generate reference links between resources |
| Utils/GeneratePatientId.hbs | Generate Patient ID |
| Utils/GenerateOrganizationId.hbs | Generate Organization ID |
| Utils/GeneratePractitionerId.hbs | Generate Practitioner ID |

## Configuration
The template uses several helper functions and conditional checks:

| Function/Helper | Purpose |
|:----------------|:--------|
| contains | Check if a string contains a specific substring |
| toString | Convert a value to a string |
| toJsonString | Convert a value to a JSON string |
| getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId | Retrieve CDA sections by template ID |
| multipleToArray | Convert multiple entries to an array |
| generateUUID | Generate a UUID based on input string |
| evaluate | Evaluate another template |

## Error Handling
This template does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying Handlebars engine to handle any errors that may occur during template processing.

## Notes
- The template includes a copyright notice at the beginning, indicating it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3.
- The template is designed to work with specific CDA document structures and may need to be adjusted if the input document format changes.
- The generated FHIR resources include both the main resources (Procedure, Observation) and related resources (Organization, Practitioner), creating a network of linked FHIR resources.
