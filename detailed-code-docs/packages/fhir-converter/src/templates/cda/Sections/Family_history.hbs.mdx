title: "Family_history.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to process and transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) family history data into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It specifically handles the Family History section of a CDA document and generates corresponding FHIR FamilyMemberHistory resources.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template checks for the presence of a specific template ID in the input message and processes family history entries if found.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| msg | Object | The input CDA message containing family history data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the input message contains the template ID '2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.15' for family history section.
2. If found, it retrieves the first CDA section with this template ID.
3. Iterates through each entry in the family history section.
4. For each entry, it generates a FamilyMemberHistory resource and a corresponding patient reference.

### FamilyMemberHistory Partial
#### Description
This partial template (referenced as `Resources/FamilyMemberHistory.hbs`) is called to generate a FHIR FamilyMemberHistory resource for each family history entry.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| familyEntry | Object | The family history entry from the CDA document |
| ID | String | A generated UUID for the FamilyMemberHistory resource |

### Patient Reference Partial
#### Description
This partial template (referenced as `References/FamilyMemberHistory/patient.hbs`) is called to generate a patient reference for each FamilyMemberHistory resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The generated UUID for the FamilyMemberHistory resource |
| REF | String | The patient reference string |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Utils/GeneratePatientId.hbs | Used to generate a patient ID |

## Notes
- The template uses several custom Handlebars helpers such as `contains`, `toString`, `toJsonString`, `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`, `toArray`, `generateUUID`, and `evaluate`.
- The template is designed to work with a specific CDA template ID for family history sections.
- The generated FHIR resources include both FamilyMemberHistory resources and their corresponding patient references.
- The template assumes the existence of a `@metriportPatientId` context variable for patient ID generation.

This template plays a crucial role in converting CDA family history data to FHIR format, enabling interoperability between different healthcare systems that may use these different standards.
