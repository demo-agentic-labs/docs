## High-level description
This Handlebars template is designed to process and transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data related to postoperative diagnoses into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It specifically handles the conversion of postoperative diagnosis information from CDA to FHIR Condition resources.

## Symbols

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template iterates through CDA sections with a specific template ID to extract postoperative diagnosis information and convert it into FHIR Condition resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId` helper to find the relevant CDA section.
2. Iterates through entries in the section.
3. For each entry, processes observation data to create Condition resources.
4. Generates references to link the Condition resources to the patient.

### Helpers and Partials Used
1. `getFirstCdaSectionsByTemplateId`: Retrieves CDA sections by template ID.
2. `toArray`: Converts data to an array format.
3. `generateUUID`: Generates a unique identifier.
4. `toJsonString`: Converts data to a JSON string.
5. `Resources/Condition.hbs`: Partial template for creating FHIR Condition resources.
6. `Utils/GeneratePatientId.hbs`: Partial template for generating patient IDs.
7. `References/Condition/subject.hbs`: Partial template for creating subject references in Condition resources.

## Dependencies
This template relies on several Handlebars helpers and partial templates, which are not defined in this file but are presumably available in the broader template system.

## Configuration
The template uses a specific CDA template ID for postoperative diagnosis sections:
| Option | Value |
|:-------|:------|
| CDA Template ID | 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.35 |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but modified and licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.
2. The template is designed to work within a larger FHIR conversion system, as evidenced by the use of various helpers and partials.
3. Error handling and logging are not explicitly implemented in this template, suggesting they might be handled at a higher level in the conversion process.
