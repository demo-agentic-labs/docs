title: "Goal.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Goal resource. It outlines how various elements of a goal entry in CDA format are mapped to corresponding fields in the FHIR Goal resource.

## Symbols

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template defines the structure of a FHIR Goal resource, including its identifier, description, lifecycle status, priority, and target.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| goalEntry | Object | The CDA goal entry containing various properties to be mapped to FHIR Goal resource |
| ID | String | A unique identifier for the Goal resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| FHIR Goal Resource | JSON | A FHIR-compliant Goal resource in JSON format |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resource type as "Goal" and assigns the provided ID.
2. Maps identifiers from the CDA goal entry to FHIR identifiers.
3. Sets the goal description using the CDA goal entry's code.
4. Maps the CDA status code to the FHIR lifecycle status.
5. Extracts the priority from a specific entry relationship observation.
6. Defines the target, including measure, detail quantity, and due date.
7. Sets up the request method and URL for the resource.

### Partial Templates
The main template uses several partial templates for mapping specific data types:

1. `DataType/Identifier.hbs`: Used for mapping identifiers.
2. `DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs`: Used for mapping coded concepts (description, priority, target measure).

These partial templates are referenced using the `{{&gt;PartialName}}` syntax and are likely defined in separate files.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the FHIR JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template uses several Handlebars helpers:

| Helper | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| toArray | Converts a value to an array |
| elementAt | Retrieves an element at a specific index from an array |
| addHyphensDate | Likely formats a date string by adding hyphens |

Note: These helpers are not defined in this file and are presumably available in the Handlebars environment where this template is used.

## Error Handling
The template includes some basic error handling:
- Uses the `canBeUnknown=true` parameter for the description, allowing it to be undefined.
- Checks for the existence of `goalEntry.code.translation` before using it, falling back to `goalEntry.code` if not present.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but it's worth noting that the template assumes a specific structure for the input `goalEntry` object. Any changes to the input data structure might require updates to this template.
