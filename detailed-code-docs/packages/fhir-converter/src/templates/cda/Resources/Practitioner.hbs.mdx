## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Practitioner resource. It outlines how to map various practitioner details such as identifiers, names, addresses, and qualifications from CDA format to the corresponding FHIR Practitioner resource structure.

## Code Structure
The template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically generate a JSON structure representing a FHIR Practitioner resource. It includes sections for resource metadata, identifiers, names, addresses, telecom information, and qualifications. Each section uses Handlebars helpers and partials to process and format the data appropriately.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template defines the overall structure of the FHIR Practitioner resource, including its metadata and core attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the Practitioner resource |
| practitioner | object | CDA practitioner data to be converted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | FHIR Practitioner resource representation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resource type as "Practitioner"
2. Includes US Core profile metadata
3. Populates resource ID
4. Iterates through practitioner data to populate identifiers, names, addresses, telecom, and qualifications
5. Defines a PUT request for the resource

### Partials
The template uses several partials to handle specific data types:

1. `DataType/Identifier.hbs`
2. `DataType/HumanName.hbs`
3. `DataType/Address.hbs`
4. `DataType/ContactPoint.hbs`
5. `DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs`

These partials are responsible for formatting specific data types according to FHIR specifications.

## Dependencies
The template relies on Handlebars and its built-in helpers, as well as custom helpers like `toArray`.

## Configuration
The template uses the US Core profile for Practitioner, as specified in the `meta.profile` field:
```json
"profile": [
    "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-practitioner"
]
```

## Error Handling
The template does not implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the input data is valid and that all required fields are present.

## Notes
1. The template includes a copyright notice and license information at the beginning.
2. The `fullUrl` field uses a URN (Uniform Resource Name) with a UUID format.
3. The template supports multiple identifiers, names, addresses, telecom entries, and qualifications for a practitioner.
4. The `request` object at the end suggests that this resource is intended to be used in a FHIR transaction or batch operation with a PUT method.

This template provides a structured way to convert CDA practitioner data into a FHIR-compliant Practitioner resource, ensuring interoperability between different healthcare systems that support the FHIR standard.
