## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) allergy data into a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) AllergyIntolerance resource. It creates a JSON representation of an AllergyIntolerance resource, including its identifier, clinical status, reaction details, and onset date.

### AllergyIntolerance Resource Template
#### Description
This is the main template for creating an AllergyIntolerance resource. It defines the structure of the resource, including its unique identifier, clinical status, reaction details, and onset date.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Unique identifier for the AllergyIntolerance resource |
| allergyEntry | Object | Contains allergy information from the CDA document |
| allergyStatus | Object | Contains the status of the allergy |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a unique identifier for the resource using the provided ID.
2. Sets the clinical status using the allergyStatus code.
3. Defines the reaction, including the substance and manifestation.
4. Sets the onset date if available.
5. Handles multiple reaction entries if present in the allergyEntry.entryRelationship.
6. Sets the severity of the allergy reaction if available.

### Partial Templates
The main template uses several partial templates to populate specific sections:

1. `DataType/Identifier.hbs`: Used to generate identifier information.
2. `ValueSet/AllergyStatus.hbs`: Used to map the allergy status code.
3. `DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs`: Used to generate CodeableConcept structures for substance and manifestation.
4. `ValueSet/AllergySeverity.hbs`: Used to map the allergy severity.

These partial templates are referenced using the `{{&gt;PartialName}}` syntax and are likely defined in separate files.

## Dependencies
The template relies on several helper functions:
- `toArray`: Converts a value to an array.
- `contains`: Checks if a string contains a substring.
- `toJsonString`: Converts a value to a JSON string.
- `formatAsDateTime`: Formats a date value as a datetime string.

These helpers are likely defined in a separate helper file or provided by the templating engine.

## Configuration
The template uses specific OIDs (Object Identifiers) to identify certain types of data:
- "2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.9": Likely identifies a reaction observation.
- "2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.8": Likely identifies a severity observation.

These OIDs are used to determine how to process different parts of the input data.

## Error Handling
The template uses conditional statements to handle cases where certain data might be missing. For example, it checks for the existence of `allergyEntry.entryRelationship` before processing reaction details.

## API/Interface Reference
This template expects to be called with specific context data, including:
- An `ID` for the resource
- An `allergyEntry` object containing allergy information
- An `allergyStatus` object containing the status of the allergy

The output is a JSON structure representing a FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource, which can be used in a FHIR-compliant system.
