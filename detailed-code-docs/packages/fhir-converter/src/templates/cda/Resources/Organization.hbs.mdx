## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating an Organization resource in FHIR format. It transforms data from a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format into a FHIR Organization resource, including identifiers, name, address, and telecom information.

### Organization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Organization resource with a fullUrl, resource details, and a request object for PUT operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the Organization |
| org | object | Contains organization details from CDA format |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A FHIR-compliant Organization resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the fullUrl and id using the provided ID.
2. Populates identifiers using the `Identifier.hbs` partial template.
3. Sets the organization name, preferring `org.name._` over `org.representedOrganization.name._`, with a fallback to "unknown".
4. Populates address information using the `Address.hbs` partial template.
5. Populates telecom information using the `ContactPoint.hbs` partial template.
6. Includes a request object for PUT operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Identifier.hbs | Partial template for creating identifier objects |
| Address.hbs | Partial template for creating address objects |
| ContactPoint.hbs | Partial template for creating contact point objects |

## Notes
- The template uses Handlebars helpers like `toArray` to handle potential array or single-object scenarios.
- The `isOrg` flag is set to true when calling the Address partial, indicating that this address is for an organization.
- The template includes error handling for missing name information, defaulting to "unknown" if neither `org.name._` nor `org.representedOrganization.name._` is available.
