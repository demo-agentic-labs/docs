### Location Resource Template
#### Description
This is the main Handlebars template that generates a FHIR Location resource. It includes various properties of a Location, such as identifiers, name, address, telecom, and type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the Location resource |
| location | object | Contains details about the location, including playingEntity, addr, telecom, and code |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A FHIR-compliant Location resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a fullUrl using the provided ID
2. Sets the resourceType to "Location"
3. Generates identifiers using the `Identifier` partial template
4. Sets the name from the location's playingEntity name
5. Generates the address using the `Address` partial template
6. Creates telecom entries using the `ContactPoint` partial template
7. Generates type entries using the `CodeableConcept` partial template
8. Includes a request object for PUT method

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Identifier.hbs | Partial template for generating identifier entries |
| Address.hbs | Partial template for generating address information |
| ContactPoint.hbs | Partial template for generating telecom entries |
| CodeableConcept.hbs | Partial template for generating type entries |

## Notes
1. The template uses Handlebars helpers like `toArray` to handle potential single or multiple entries for identifiers, telecom, and type.
2. The template includes a copyright notice and license information at the beginning.
3. The output is structured to be part of a larger FHIR Bundle, as indicated by the `fullUrl` and `request` properties.

This template is crucial for converting location data from a source format (likely CDA) into the FHIR Location resource format, ensuring interoperability and standardization of healthcare location information.
