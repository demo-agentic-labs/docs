### Main Template
#### Description
The main template generates a FHIR Coverage resource within a Bundle entry structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Unique identifier for the Coverage resource |
| payerEntry | Object | Contains information about the payer, including identifiers, status, and relationship code |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A FHIR Bundle entry containing a Coverage resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `fullUrl` using the provided `ID`.
2. Generates the Coverage resource with the following elements:
   - `resourceType`: Set to "Coverage"
   - `id`: Set to the provided `ID`
   - `identifier`: An array of identifiers generated from `payerEntry.id`
   - `status`: Derived from `payerEntry.statusCode.code`
   - `relationship`: Derived from `payerEntry.code`
3. Includes a `request` object for RESTful operations, specifying the PUT method and the resource URL.

### Partial Templates
The main template uses several partial templates:

1. `DataType/Identifier.hbs`: Used to generate identifier objects.
2. `ValueSet/FMStatus.hbs`: Used to map the status code to a FHIR-compliant status.
3. `DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs`: Used to generate a CodeableConcept for the relationship.

## TODOs
The template includes two commented-out sections indicating missing mappings:
1. CCDA Policy Holder to FHIR policyHolder
2. CCDA Guarantor to FHIR Participant Extension

These comments suggest that additional work may be needed to complete the mapping from CDA to FHIR for these specific elements.

## Dependencies
This template relies on Handlebars.js for template rendering and assumes the existence of helper functions like `toArray`.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that all required input data is present and correctly formatted.
