## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various FHIR resources from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data. The templates define the structure and mapping logic for converting CDA elements into FHIR-compliant JSON representations of different healthcare resources.

## What does it do?
These templates transform clinical data from CDA format into standardized FHIR resources. This conversion process allows healthcare systems using CDA to interoperate with systems that use FHIR, enabling better data exchange and integration across different healthcare platforms. Each template focuses on a specific FHIR resource type, such as Patient, Observation, MedicationRequest, etc., and maps the relevant CDA data to the corresponding FHIR structure.

## Key Files
1. Patient.hbs: Generates a FHIR Patient resource, including demographics, contact information, and communication preferences.

2. Observation.hbs: Creates FHIR Observation resources for various clinical measurements and findings.

3. MedicationRequest.hbs: Produces FHIR MedicationRequest resources for medication orders and prescriptions.

4. Procedure.hbs: Generates FHIR Procedure resources for clinical procedures and interventions.

5. Condition.hbs: Creates FHIR Condition resources for patient diagnoses and health conditions.

6. AllergyIntolerance.hbs: Produces FHIR AllergyIntolerance resources for patient allergies and intolerances.

7. Immunization.hbs: Generates FHIR Immunization resources for patient vaccination records.

8. DiagnosticReport.hbs: Creates FHIR DiagnosticReport resources for clinical diagnostic test results.

These templates form the core of the CDA to FHIR conversion process, each handling a specific aspect of clinical data.

## Dependencies
The templates rely on Handlebars.js for templating functionality. They also use various helper functions and partial templates, which are likely defined in separate files within the project structure. Common dependencies include:

- DataType/*.hbs: Partial templates for FHIR data types (e.g., Identifier, CodeableConcept, HumanName)
- ValueSet/*.hbs: Templates for mapping CDA codes to FHIR value sets
- Utils/*.hbs: Utility templates for common operations

## Configuration
The templates are designed to work with specific input data structures from CDA documents. They often include configuration options through Handlebars helpers and partials. Many templates reference FHIR profiles, such as US Core, indicating compliance with specific FHIR implementation guides.

Key configuration aspects include:
- Resource-specific identifiers (e.g., `ID` input parameter)
- FHIR profile URLs (e.g., "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient")
- Value set references (e.g., "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/languages")

The templates are part of a larger FHIR conversion system and expect specific input data structures. They generate FHIR resources that conform to standard FHIR specifications and often to specific profiles like US Core.
