## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for generating a FHIR FamilyMemberHistory resource. It transforms data from a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format into the FHIR JSON structure, capturing information about a patient's family member's medical history.

## Code Structure
The template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR FamilyMemberHistory resource. It includes various fields such as identifier, status, relationship, sex, birth date, and conditions. The structure follows the FHIR specification for FamilyMemberHistory resources.

### Main Template
#### Description
This is the main Handlebars template that generates the FamilyMemberHistory resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the resource |
| familyEntry | object | Contains family member information from the CDA document |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A FHIR-compliant FamilyMemberHistory resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FHIR FamilyMemberHistory resource with a unique ID.
2. Populates the resource with data from the `familyEntry` object.
3. Sets the status to "completed".
4. Maps the family relationship and sex using CodeableConcept helpers.
5. Includes the birth date as a string.
6. Iterates through conditions, mapping them to the FHIR structure.
7. Checks for specific templateIds to determine if a condition contributed to death or to set the onset age.

## Side Effects
This template doesn't have direct side effects as it's a pure transformation of data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| DataType/Identifier.hbs | Helper template for generating FHIR Identifier data type |
| DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs | Helper template for generating FHIR CodeableConcept data type |
| DataType/Age.hbs | Helper template for generating FHIR Age data type |

## TODOs
- Add date from effectiveTime (commented out in the template)

## Notes
1. The template uses custom Handlebars helpers like `toArray` to handle potential single or multiple entries.
2. The template includes a copyright notice indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
3. The generated resource includes a `request` object, suggesting this might be used in a FHIR transaction or batch operation.
4. Some fields (like `contributedToDeath` and `onsetAge`) are conditionally included based on specific templateIds in the CDA data.
5. The template doesn't handle all possible fields of a FamilyMemberHistory resource, focusing on a subset of commonly used fields.
