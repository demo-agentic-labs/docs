## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Device resource. It creates a JSON representation of a Device resource, including its identifier, type, manufacturer, and version information.

## Symbols

### Root Template
#### Description
The root template defines the overall structure of the FHIR Device resource, including its fullUrl, resource details, and request information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Unique identifier for the Device resource |
| author | Object | Contains information about the device author |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A FHIR-compliant Device resource representation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the fullUrl and resource id using the provided ID.
2. Populates the identifier array using the `author.id` data.
3. Sets the device type and manufacturer using `author.assignedAuthoringDevice.manufacturerModelName._`.
4. Sets the device version using `author.assignedAuthoringDevice.softwareName._`.
5. Includes a request object for PUT method to update the Device resource.

### Partial Template: DataType/Identifier.hbs
#### Description
This is a partial template used to generate the identifier section of the Device resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | Object | Contains identifier information |

#### Internal Logic
The template iterates over the `author.id` array and applies the `DataType/Identifier.hbs` partial template to each element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, covering both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax, including helpers like `{{#each}}` for iteration and `{{&gt;}}` for including partial templates.
3. The `toArray` helper is used to ensure `author.id` is treated as an array, even if it contains a single item.
4. The template generates a FHIR-compliant Device resource structure, including the required `resourceType` field.
5. The `fullUrl` and `id` fields use a generated or provided `ID` value.
6. The `request` object at the end suggests this template is designed for use in a FHIR transaction or batch operation, specifically for updating an existing Device resource.
