title: "LocationForHeader.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating a FHIR Location resource, specifically for use in a header. It transforms CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into a FHIR-compliant JSON format for a Location resource.

## Code Structure
The template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically generate a JSON object representing a FHIR Location resource. It includes various nested structures and uses helper functions to process and format the data.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template generates a JSON object for a FHIR Location resource, including its fullUrl, resource details, and request information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the Location resource |
| location | object | Contains location details from the CDA document |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a fullUrl using the provided ID
2. Generates the resource object with various properties:
   - resourceType (set to "Location")
   - id
   - identifier (using the DataType/Identifier partial)
   - name
   - address (using the DataType/Address partial)
   - telecom (using the DataType/ContactPoint partial)
   - type (using the DataType/CodeableConcept partial)
3. Includes a request object for PUT method

### Partial Templates
The main template uses several partial templates to generate specific sections:

1. `DataType/Identifier.hbs`
2. `DataType/Address.hbs`
3. `DataType/ContactPoint.hbs`
4. `DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs`

These partials are used to format specific data types according to FHIR specifications.

### Helper Functions
The template uses custom helper functions:

1. `toArray`: Likely converts a single item or object into an array, ensuring consistent iteration.

## Dependencies
The template relies on Handlebars for templating and assumes the existence of helper functions and partial templates.

## Configuration
The template doesn't define explicit configuration options but relies on the structure of the input data (particularly the `location` object) to populate the FHIR resource.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in the template. It assumes that the required data is present in the input.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It specifically handles the creation of a Location resource, which could be used in various FHIR-based healthcare applications.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| Location/{{ID}} | PUT | N/A | Location resource | Creates or updates a Location resource |

Note: The actual API endpoint and method are inferred from the `request` object in the template. The specific implementation of how this template is used in API calls would depend on the larger system it's part of.
