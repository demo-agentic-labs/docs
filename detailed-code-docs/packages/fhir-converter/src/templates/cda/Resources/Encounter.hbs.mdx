## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for generating a FHIR Encounter resource. It outlines the JSON structure of an Encounter, including its status, reason codes, class, type, identifier, period, priority, and hospitalization details.

## Code Structure
The template uses various Handlebars helpers and partials to populate the Encounter resource fields. It references other templates (e.g., ValueSet/EncounterStatus.hbs, DataType/Coding.hbs) to generate specific data types and value sets.

### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This is the main template for creating a FHIR Encounter resource. It defines the structure and populates it with data from the CDA document.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| encounter | Object | Contains encounter details from the CDA document |
| reasonCodes | Object | Contains reasons for the encounter |
| ID | String | Unique identifier for the encounter |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A FHIR-compliant Encounter resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resource type to "Encounter" and assigns the provided ID.
2. Determines the encounter status, defaulting to "unknown" if not provided.
3. Populates reason codes using the `toArray` helper and `toJsonString` for proper JSON formatting.
4. Sets the encounter class and type using the `DataType/Coding.hbs` partial.
5. Adds identifiers using the `DataType/Identifier.hbs` partial.
6. Sets the encounter period using the `DataType/Period.hbs` partial.
7. Adds priority and discharge disposition information.
8. Includes a request object for PUT operation.

## Side Effects
This template doesn't have direct side effects, but it relies on other partial templates and helpers to generate the complete Encounter resource.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Error Handling
The template includes some error handling, such as providing default values (e.g., "unknown" for status) when data is missing. However, it largely depends on the data provided and the referenced partials for complete error handling.

## Notes
1. The template includes a copyright notice and license information at the top.
2. It uses triple braces `{{{...}}}` for inserting unescaped JSON strings, particularly for reason codes.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, accommodating various optional fields in the Encounter resource.
