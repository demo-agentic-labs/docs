## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicationStatement resource. It maps various elements from the CDA format to the corresponding FHIR MedicationStatement fields, ensuring interoperability between different healthcare data standards.

### MedicationStatement Template
#### Description
This is the main Handlebars template that constructs a FHIR MedicationStatement resource from CDA data. It includes various nested objects and arrays to represent different aspects of a medication statement.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| medicationStatement | object | CDA medication statement data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| MedicationStatement | object | FHIR MedicationStatement resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resource type to "MedicationStatement" and assigns the provided ID.
2. Maps identifiers from the CDA data to FHIR identifiers.
3. Converts the status code to a FHIR MedicationStatementStatus.
4. Sets the effective period using the CDA effectiveTime or a default period.
5. Constructs a dosage object, including:
   - Text description
   - Route of administration
   - Dose quantity or range
6. Includes a request object for PUT method to update or create the resource.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| DataType/Identifier.hbs | Mapping CDA identifiers to FHIR Identifier type |
| ValueSet/MedicationStatementStatus.hbs | Converting CDA status codes to FHIR MedicationStatementStatus |
| Utils/PeriodOrDefaultPeriod.hbs | Handling effective time periods |
| DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs | Mapping CDA codes to FHIR CodeableConcept type |
| DataType/Range.hbs | Handling dose ranges |
| DataType/Quantity.hbs | Handling dose quantities |

## References
The template references several helper functions and partial templates:
- `toArray`
- `parseReferenceData`
- `extractRangeFromQuantity`

These helpers are likely defined in a separate file and used to process and transform data within the template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a copyright notice and license information at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but modified by Metriport Inc.
2. The template uses the FHIR R4 version, as evidenced by the comment referencing the FHIR R4 Dosage resource.
3. The template does not map the "precondition" field from CDA to FHIR, as noted in a comment.
4. The template uses a custom helper `extractRangeFromQuantity` to determine whether to use a doseRange or doseQuantity in the dosage information.

This template plays a crucial role in converting CDA medication data to the FHIR standard, facilitating interoperability between different healthcare systems and data formats.
