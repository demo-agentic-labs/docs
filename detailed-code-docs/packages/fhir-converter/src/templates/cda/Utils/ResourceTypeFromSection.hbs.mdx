## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a mapping between CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) section template IDs and corresponding FHIR resource types. It's used to determine the appropriate FHIR resource type based on the template ID of a CDA section.

## Symbols

### resourceType
#### Description
This is the main symbol in the template. It's a Handlebars expression that determines the FHIR resource type based on the `section.templateId` of the CDA document.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| section.templateId | String | The template ID of the CDA section |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | String | The corresponding FHIR resource type |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses a series of conditional statements to check the `section.templateId` against known CDA template IDs and returns the corresponding FHIR resource type. For example:
- If the template ID contains "2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.6.1", it returns "AllergyIntolerance"
- If the template ID contains "2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.1.1", it returns "MedicationStatement"
- And so on for various other template IDs

If no match is found and a section exists, it returns an empty string.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the following Handlebars helpers:
- `contains`: Used to check if the `section.templateId` contains a specific string
- `toJsonString`: Used to convert the `section.templateId` to a JSON string for comparison

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. If the `section.templateId` doesn't match any of the defined conditions and there's no section, no resource type will be returned.

## Performance Considerations
The template uses a series of `if-else` statements, which could potentially impact performance for large documents with many sections. However, for typical use cases, this should not be a significant concern.

## TODOs
There's a comment suggesting a potential improvement:
```handlebars
{{!-- Why not also 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.7, optional? --}}
```
This indicates that there might be an additional template ID that could be considered for the "Procedure" resource type.
