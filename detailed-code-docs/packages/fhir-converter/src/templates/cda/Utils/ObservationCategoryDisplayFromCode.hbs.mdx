## High-level description
This Handlebars template file provides a utility for converting observation category codes to their corresponding display names in the context of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) conversion. It maps specific category codes to human-readable display strings.

### ObservationCategoryDisplayFromCode
#### Description
This template takes an observation category code as input and returns a JSON object containing the corresponding display name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | The observation category code to be converted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| display | string | The human-readable display name corresponding to the input code |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars conditional statements to check the input `code` against predefined values and returns the appropriate display name:

1. If the code is "social-history", it returns "Social History"
2. If the code is "vital-signs", it returns "Vital Signs"
3. If the code is "laboratory", it returns "Laboratory"
4. If the code is "procedure", it returns "Procedure"

If the input code doesn't match any of these predefined values, no display name is returned.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for its functionality.
| Dependency | Purpose |

| Handlebars | Templating engine used for conditional logic and output generation |

## Notes
1. The template is part of a FHIR converter system, likely used in healthcare data processing.
2. It includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template handles only four specific observation category codes. If other codes are used in the system, they would need to be added to this template for proper display name conversion.
4. The output is in JSON format, which suggests it's likely used as part of a larger JSON-based data processing pipeline.
