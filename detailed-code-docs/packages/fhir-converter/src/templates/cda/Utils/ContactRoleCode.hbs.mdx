## High-level description
This Handlebars template file, `ContactRoleCode.hbs`, is designed to generate JSON output for contact role codes in a healthcare context. It maps specific role codes to their corresponding display names and code systems, which are likely used in HL7 or FHIR-related data transformations.

### ContactRoleCode Template
#### Description
This template takes a `code` input and generates a JSON object with the corresponding `code`, `displayName`, and `codeSystem` for various contact roles in healthcare settings.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | A code representing a specific contact role |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | Contains `code`, `displayName`, and `codeSystem` for the given contact role code |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses a series of `{{#if}}` conditional statements to check the input `code` against predefined values. When a match is found, it outputs a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
    "code": "&lt;input_code&gt;",
    "displayName": "&lt;human_readable_description&gt;",
    "codeSystem": "2.16.840.1.113883.5.111"
}
```

The template supports the following code mappings:

1. "BILL" - Billing Contact
2. "ORG" - Organizational contact
3. "PAYOR" - Payor contact
4. "ECON" - Emergency contact
5. "NOK" - Next of Kin
6. "AGNT" - Agent
7. "CAREGIVER" - Caregiver
8. "PRS" - Personal Relationship

If the input `code` doesn't match any of these predefined values, no output will be generated.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The code system "2.16.840.1.113883.5.111" is used consistently for all contact role codes, suggesting it's a standard OID (Object Identifier) for this particular code set in healthcare informatics.

## Error Handling
The template does not include explicit error handling. If an unrecognized code is provided, the template will silently produce no output.

## Notes
1. The template is part of a larger system for converting healthcare data, likely between different standards or formats.
2. The consistent use of the code system suggests this is part of a standardized coding system, possibly related to HL7 or FHIR standards.
3. The template could be extended to include more role codes if needed in the future.
4. Consider adding a default case to handle unrecognized codes, which could improve error detection and debugging.
