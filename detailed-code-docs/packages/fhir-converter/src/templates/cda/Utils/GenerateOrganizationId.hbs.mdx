title: "GenerateOrganizationId.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template generates a unique identifier (UUID) for an organization based on its name, address, and telecom information. It's designed to be used in the context of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data conversion from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object with an "Id" field containing a generated UUID based on the organization's details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| obj | Object | An object containing organization details |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | String | A JSON string containing an "Id" field with a generated UUID |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template checks if the `obj` input exists.
2. If `obj` exists, it generates a JSON object with an "Id" field.
3. The value of the "Id" field is created using two helper functions:
   - `concatDefined`: Concatenates the defined values of `obj.name`, `obj.addr`, and `obj.telecom`.
   - `generateUUID`: Generates a UUID based on the concatenated string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for rendering the JSON output |

## Configuration
This template relies on two custom Handlebars helpers that are not defined in this file:

| Helper | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| concatDefined | Concatenates defined values from the input object |
| generateUUID | Generates a UUID based on the input string |

Note: The implementation of these helpers is not provided in this file and would need to be defined elsewhere in the application.

## Error Handling
The template includes a basic form of error prevention by checking if the `obj` input exists before attempting to generate the UUID. If `obj` is falsy (undefined, null, etc.), no output will be generated.
