title: "GenerateLocationId.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template generates a unique identifier (UUID) for a location based on available location information such as address, name, and code. It's designed to work with different location data structures within a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) context.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object with an "Id" field. The value of this field is a UUID generated from concatenated location information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| location | Object | An object containing location information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object with an "Id" field containing a generated UUID |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template checks for the presence of `location.location.addr`.
2. If `location.location.addr` exists, it generates a UUID using `location.location.addr`, `location.location.name`, and `location.code`.
3. If `location.location.addr` doesn't exist but `location.addr` does, it generates a UUID using `location.addr`, `location.playingEntity.name`, and `location.code`.
4. The UUID is generated using the `generateUUID` helper function, which takes the concatenated string produced by the `concatDefined` helper function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| generateUUID | Helper function to generate a UUID from a string |
| concatDefined | Helper function to concatenate defined values |

## Notes
1. The template is designed to handle two different location data structures, likely to accommodate variations in the input data format.
2. The use of the `concatDefined` helper suggests that it only includes defined (non-null, non-undefined) values in the concatenation, which helps in creating a consistent identifier even when some fields are missing.
3. The template is part of a larger FHIR converter system, as indicated by the copyright notice and the context of use.
