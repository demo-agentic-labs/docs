## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It includes templates for various types of clinical documents, such as Consultation Notes, Discharge Summaries, and Progress Notes, as well as utility templates for handling specific data types and value sets.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory collectively perform the following functions:

1. Convert different types of CDA documents (e.g., Consultation Notes, Discharge Summaries, Progress Notes) into FHIR Bundle resources.
2. Transform specific sections of CDA documents (e.g., allergies, medications, problems) into corresponding FHIR resources.
3. Map CDA data types to FHIR data types (e.g., addresses, human names, identifiers).
4. Handle value set mappings for various codes and statuses used in healthcare data.
5. Generate unique identifiers and references for FHIR resources.
6. Create FHIR extensions for specific data elements like ethnicity and race.

These templates work together to ensure that clinical data from CDA documents is accurately and comprehensively converted into FHIR format, maintaining the semantic meaning and relationships of the original data.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this conversion process are the high-level document templates:

1. `ConsultationNote.hbs`
2. `DischargeSummary.hbs`
3. `HistoryandPhysical.hbs`
4. `OperativeNote.hbs`
5. `ProcedureNote.hbs`
6. `ProgressNote.hbs`
7. `ReferralNote.hbs`
8. `TransferSummary.hbs`
9. `ccd.hbs`

These templates define the overall structure of the FHIR Bundle for each document type and include various section templates as needed.

## Key Files
1. `Header.hbs`: Processes the header section of CDA documents, creating core FHIR resources like Patient, Practitioner, and Encounter.

2. `Sections/` directory: Contains templates for converting specific sections of CDA documents (e.g., Allergies_and_Adverse_Reactions.hbs, Medication.hbs, Problems.hbs).

3. `DataType/` directory: Includes templates for converting CDA data types to FHIR data types (e.g., Address.hbs, HumanName.hbs, Identifier.hbs).

4. `ValueSet/` directory: Contains templates for mapping various codes and statuses to FHIR-compliant values.

5. `Extensions/` directory: Includes templates for creating FHIR extensions, particularly for ethnicity and race data.

6. `Utils/` directory: Contains utility templates for generating IDs, mapping codes, and handling specific data extraction tasks.

## Dependencies
The templates in this directory primarily depend on:

1. Handlebars: The templating engine used for processing the templates.
2. Custom helper functions: Various helper functions are used across the templates for tasks like generating UUIDs, manipulating arrays, and handling null values.
3. FHIR specification: The templates are designed to produce FHIR-compliant resources, likely adhering to a specific FHIR version.
4. CDA specification: The templates are built to understand and process CDA documents conforming to specific CDA templates.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the templates use various implicit configurations:

1. CDA template IDs: Used to identify specific sections in CDA documents.
2. FHIR resource types: Mapped to corresponding CDA sections.
3. Value set mappings: Hardcoded in various templates in the ValueSet directory.
4. System references: OID to FHIR URL mappings defined in SystemReference.hbs.

These configurations are embedded within the templates and may need to be updated if standards or requirements change.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of templates for converting CDA documents to FHIR format, covering various document types, sections, data types, and value sets. The modular structure allows for flexibility and maintainability in the conversion process.
