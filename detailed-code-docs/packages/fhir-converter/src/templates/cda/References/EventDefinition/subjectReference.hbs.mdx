title: "subjectReference.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR EventDefinition resource structure, specifically focusing on the `subjectReference` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### EventDefinition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR EventDefinition resource with a `subjectReference` field. The EventDefinition resource is used to define a "template" for an event that may occur in the healthcare domain.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the EventDefinition resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the subject of the event definition |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR EventDefinition resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "EventDefinition".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `subjectReference` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders (\{\{ID\}\} and \{\{REF\}\}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial resource structure. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR EventDefinition resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (\{\{...\}\}) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
