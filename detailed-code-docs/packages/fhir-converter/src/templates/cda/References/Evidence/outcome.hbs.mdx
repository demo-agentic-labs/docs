### Evidence Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an Evidence resource in FHIR format. It includes an "outcome" field that references another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Evidence resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the outcome resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing an Evidence FHIR resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" to "Evidence"
   - "id" to the provided {{ID}}
   - "outcome" as an array with a single object containing a "reference" field set to the provided {{REF}}

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the Evidence resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the reference to the outcome resource |

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. Error management would likely be handled by the system using this template.

## Logging
No specific logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used within a FHIR converter system. It expects to receive values for {{ID}} and {{REF}} when the template is processed.
