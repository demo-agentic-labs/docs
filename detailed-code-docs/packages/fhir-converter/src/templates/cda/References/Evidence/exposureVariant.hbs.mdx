### Evidence Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an Evidence resource in FHIR format. It includes an "exposureVariant" array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Evidence resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the exposureVariant |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing an Evidence FHIR resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Evidence".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates an "exposureVariant" array with a single object containing a "reference" field.
5. The "reference" field is populated with the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) which should be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.
