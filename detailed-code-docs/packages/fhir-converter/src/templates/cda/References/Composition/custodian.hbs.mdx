### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Composition resource structure with a custodian element. The custodian is represented as a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the custodian resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR Composition resource with a custodian element.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" as "Composition"
   - "id" using the provided `{{ID}}` value
   - "custodian" object with a "reference" property set to the provided `{{REF}}` value

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and helper functions to convert CDA documents to FHIR format.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Placeholder for the Composition resource's unique identifier |
| REF | String | Placeholder for the reference to the custodian resource |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Composition resource, focusing solely on the custodian element. It's likely used as part of a larger template or compilation process to create complete FHIR resources.
3. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) suggests that this template is processed by a Handlebars engine, with the actual values for ID and REF being provided at runtime or during the conversion process.
