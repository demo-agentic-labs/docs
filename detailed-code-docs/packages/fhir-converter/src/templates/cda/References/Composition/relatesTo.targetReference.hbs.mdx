### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Composition resource with a `relatesTo` field, which is used to establish relationships between this Composition and other resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the related resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Composition resource with a `relatesTo` field containing a `targetReference`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Composition resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Composition".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` of the Composition.
4. It creates a `relatesTo` array with a single object.
5. Inside this object, it sets a `targetReference` with a `reference` field using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of the Metriport Inc. project.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The structure of the output JSON is compliant with the FHIR standard for Composition resources.
4. The `relatesTo` field is used to express relationships between this Composition and other resources, which could be useful for linking related clinical documents or indicating document versions.
