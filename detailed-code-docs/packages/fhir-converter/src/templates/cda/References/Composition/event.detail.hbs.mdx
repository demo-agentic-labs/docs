### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Composition resource, specifically focusing on the event detail section.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the event detail |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Composition resource with event details |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets the "resourceType" to "Composition".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. An "event" array is created with a single object.
5. Within the event object, a "detail" array is created with a single object.
6. The "reference" field of the detail object is set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for generating a part of a FHIR Composition resource. It expects two inputs (`ID` and `REF`) to be provided when the template is rendered.
