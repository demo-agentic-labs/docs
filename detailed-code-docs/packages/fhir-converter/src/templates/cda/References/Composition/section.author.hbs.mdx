### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Composition resource structure with a nested section for author information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the author of the section |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Composition resource with author information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a Composition resource structure
2. Sets the resourceType to "Composition"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the resource
4. Creates a section array with one element
5. Within the section, creates an author array with one element
6. Sets the reference of the author to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable interpolation.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the author |

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used within a FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` values when rendered.

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| {{ID}}   | Should be replaced with the Composition resource identifier |
| {{REF}}  | Should be replaced with the reference to the author |

Note: This template is part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR resources. It specifically handles the author information within a Composition resource's section.
