### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Composition resource, specifically defining the `attester` field with a party reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the attester party |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Composition resource structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Composition".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates an `attester` array with a single object.
5. Within the attester object, defines a `party` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable interpolation.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the attester party |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template focuses solely on the `attester` field of a Composition resource, suggesting it's meant to be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete Composition resource.
3. The file includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
