## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of FHIR Composition resources. These templates are designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the Composition resource, such as author, attester, custodian, encounter, event details, related resources, sections, and subject.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different components of a FHIR Composition resource. They allow for the flexible construction of Composition resources by providing modular pieces that can be combined as needed. Each template generates a JSON structure representing a specific part of the Composition resource, such as:

1. Attester information
2. Author details
3. Custodian reference
4. Encounter reference
5. Event details
6. Related resource references
7. Section information, including authors and entries
8. Subject reference

When used in combination, these templates enable the conversion process to build complete FHIR Composition resources that accurately represent the structure and content of clinical documents.

## Key Files
1. `attester.party.hbs`: Generates the attester information for a Composition resource.
2. `author.hbs`: Creates the author field for a Composition resource.
3. `custodian.hbs`: Produces the custodian reference for a Composition resource.
4. `encounter.hbs`: Generates the encounter reference for a Composition resource.
5. `event.detail.hbs`: Creates the event detail section for a Composition resource.
6. `relatesTo.targetReference.hbs`: Produces the relatesTo field with a target reference for a Composition resource.
7. `section.author.hbs`: Generates a section with author information for a Composition resource.
8. `section.entry.hbs`: Creates a section with an entry reference for a Composition resource.
9. `section.focus.hbs`: Produces a section with a focus reference for a Composition resource.
10. `subject.hbs`: Generates the subject reference for a Composition resource.

Each of these files creates a partial JSON structure that represents a specific part of a FHIR Composition resource. They are designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for the creation of complex Composition resources by combining these modular components.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing placeholders and generating the final JSON structures. They are part of a larger FHIR Converter project, which is likely responsible for orchestrating the use of these templates in the overall CDA to FHIR conversion process.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have explicit configuration options, they use placeholders (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) that are expected to be replaced with actual values when the templates are rendered. The configuration of these values would be handled by the system using these templates.

Common placeholders used across the templates include:

| Placeholder | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| `{{ID}}`    | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| `{{REF}}`   | A reference to another resource (e.g., author, subject, custodian) |

These placeholders allow for dynamic content insertion, making the templates flexible and reusable for different Composition resources.

In conclusion, this directory contains a set of modular Handlebars templates that work together to generate various components of FHIR Composition resources. These templates are crucial in the process of converting CDA documents to FHIR format, providing a flexible and maintainable way to create complex Composition resources by combining smaller, focused templates.
