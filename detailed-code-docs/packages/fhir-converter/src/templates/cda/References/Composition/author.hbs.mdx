## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Composition resource structure, specifically focusing on the `author` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Composition resource, specifically defining the `author` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the author of the composition |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Composition resource with the `author` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Composition".
2. It sets the `id` of the Composition using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `author` field is defined as an array containing a single object.
4. This object has a `reference` field, populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It may depend on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`), which would be populated when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions and disclaimers.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be combined with other partial templates to form a complete FHIR Composition resource.
4. The template only defines a single author, but the FHIR specification allows for multiple authors. If multiple authors are needed, the template would need to be modified or used multiple times.
