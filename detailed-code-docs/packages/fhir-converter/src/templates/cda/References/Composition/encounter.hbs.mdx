### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Composition resource with an encounter reference. It's structured as a JSON object that can be integrated into a larger FHIR document.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Composition resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Composition",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "encounter": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets the "resourceType" to "Composition".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the "id" of the Composition.
4. It creates an "encounter" object with a "reference" property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the reference value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but is designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR document conversion process. It expects two inputs (ID and REF) to be provided when the template is rendered.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
