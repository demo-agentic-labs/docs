### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Composition resource, focusing on the section's focus element. It creates a nested structure with a single section containing a focus reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the focus element within the section |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Composition resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Composition"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "section" array with a single object
5. Within the section object, creates a "focus" object with a "reference" property
6. Assigns the provided REF value to the "reference" property

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for dynamic content insertion.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Composition resource, focusing only on the section's focus element. It may be used as part of a larger template or combined with other templates to create a complete FHIR Composition resource.
3. The structure adheres to the FHIR Composition resource format, specifically for the section and focus elements.
