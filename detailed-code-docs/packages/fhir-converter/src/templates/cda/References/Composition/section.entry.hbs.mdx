## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a FHIR Composition resource structure with a section containing an entry. It's designed to be used in the FHIR Converter project for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR format.

### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Composition resource with a single section containing one entry. The Composition resource is used to define the structure and narrative content of a clinical document.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the resource that this entry points to |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR Composition resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "Composition"
- id: The provided ID
- section: An array containing one section
  - entry: An array with one entry
    - reference: The provided REF value

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Composition resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Composition".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the Composition.
4. It creates a `section` array with one object.
5. Within the section, it creates an `entry` array with one object.
6. The entry object contains a `reference` field, which is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and helper functions to transform CDA documents to FHIR format.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. Error handling would typically be managed by the system rendering the template.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (`{{}}`) for dynamic content insertion.
3. The JSON structure is formatted for readability, with each nested level properly indented.
4. The trailing commas in the JSON structure (e.g., after `"reference":"{{REF}}",`) are not standard JSON syntax and may need to be removed or handled by the JSON parser used in the project.
