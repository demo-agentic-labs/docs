### Composition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Composition resource, specifically defining the `subject` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Composition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the composition |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Composition resource with the `subject` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure with a `resource` object.
2. Within the `resource` object, it sets the `resourceType` to "Composition".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. The `subject` field is populated with a `reference` object containing the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) which are expected to be replaced with actual values when the template is processed.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## TODOs
The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is now part of Metriport Inc.'s codebase, licensed under AGPLv3.
