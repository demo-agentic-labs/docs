### Observation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Observation resource, emphasizing the `derivedFrom` field. It's used to indicate that this Observation is derived from another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this Observation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource from which this Observation is derived |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Observation resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "Observation"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this Observation
  - `derivedFrom`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Observation".
2. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the Observation.
3. The `derivedFrom` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field, which is set to the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- This template only defines a partial Observation resource structure, focusing on the `derivedFrom` field. It would typically be used as part of a larger template or system that constructs complete FHIR resources.
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the copyright of Metriport Inc., licensed under AGPLv3.
- The structure adheres to the FHIR standard for Observation resources, specifically the `derivedFrom` field which is used to link to other resources that this Observation is based on or derived from.
