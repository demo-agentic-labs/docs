### Observation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Observation resource with a focus on the `performer` field. It's structured to be included as part of a larger FHIR Observation resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Observation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer of the observation |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Observation resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Observation".
2. It sets the `id` of the Observation to the provided `{{ID}}`.
3. The `performer` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Placeholder for the Observation resource identifier |
| REF | String | Placeholder for the performer reference |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The structure is designed to be flexible, allowing it to be integrated into a more comprehensive FHIR Observation resource.
4. The `performer` array is structured to allow for multiple performers, although this template only includes one.
