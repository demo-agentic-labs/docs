### Observation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Observation resource structure with an encounter reference. It's designed to be embedded within a larger FHIR resource construction process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Observation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated Encounter resource |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Observation resource with an encounter reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Observation".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. Creates an "encounter" object with a "reference" property, setting its value to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API itself, this template is designed to be used within a larger FHIR resource construction process. It expects two variables to be provided:

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| ID | The unique identifier for the Observation resource |
| REF | The reference to the associated Encounter resource |
