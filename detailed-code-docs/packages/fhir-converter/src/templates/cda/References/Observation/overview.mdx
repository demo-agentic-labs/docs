## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating partial FHIR Observation resources with various reference fields. These templates are part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format, specifically focusing on different aspects of the Observation resource.

## What does it do?
These templates generate JSON structures representing parts of FHIR Observation resources. Each template focuses on a specific reference field within the Observation resource, such as `basedOn`, `derivedFrom`, `device`, `encounter`, `focus`, `hasMember`, `partOf`, `performer`, `specimen`, and `subject`. These templates allow for flexible construction of Observation resources by providing modular components that can be combined to create complete resources.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Creates an Observation with a `basedOn` reference, indicating the plan or order that this observation fulfills.
2. `derivedFrom.hbs`: Generates an Observation with a `derivedFrom` reference, showing that this observation is derived from another resource.
3. `device.hbs`: Produces an Observation with a `device` reference, linking the observation to a Device resource.
4. `encounter.hbs`: Creates an Observation with an `encounter` reference, associating the observation with a specific Encounter resource.
5. `focus.hbs`: Generates an Observation with a `focus` reference, indicating another resource that this observation is about.
6. `hasMember.hbs`: Produces an Observation with a `hasMember` reference, showing that this observation has a member relationship with another resource.
7. `partOf.hbs`: Creates an Observation that is part of another resource, typically another Observation or Procedure.
8. `performer.hbs`: Generates an Observation with a `performer` reference, indicating who performed the observation.
9. `specimen.hbs`: Produces an Observation with a `specimen` reference, linking the observation to a Specimen resource.
10. `subject.hbs`: Creates an Observation with a `subject` reference, specifying the subject of the observation.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and variable substitution. They are part of the FHIR Converter project, which is likely to have additional dependencies for the overall conversion process.

## Configuration
Each template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation. The common variables across most templates are:

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| ID | The unique identifier for the Observation resource |
| REF | The reference to the associated resource (varies based on the specific template) |

There are no explicit configuration options within the templates themselves. The behavior is determined by the values provided for these variables when the templates are rendered.

## Notes
1. These templates create partial Observation resources, focusing on specific reference fields. They are designed to be combined with other templates or data to form complete FHIR Observation resources.
2. The templates follow a consistent structure, creating a JSON object with a `resource` property containing the Observation details.
3. All templates include a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
4. The modular nature of these templates allows for flexible construction of Observation resources, catering to different scenarios and relationships within the FHIR data model.
5. While these templates provide a foundation for creating Observation resources, additional logic would be needed to handle more complex scenarios, such as multiple references or conditional inclusion of fields based on available data.
