### Observation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Observation resource structure with a specimen reference. It's designed to be integrated into a larger FHIR resource construction process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Observation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated Specimen resource |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Observation resource with a specimen reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Observation".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "specimen" object with a "reference" property, using the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The structure suggests this template is meant to be used as a partial or component in a larger FHIR resource construction process, focusing specifically on the specimen reference within an Observation resource.
