### Observation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Observation resource, specifically defining the `subject` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Observation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the observation |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Observation resource with the `subject` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure with a `resource` object.
2. Within the `resource` object, it sets:
   - `resourceType` as "Observation"
   - `id` using the provided `{{ID}}` value
   - `subject` as an object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` value

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and conversion logic.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Placeholder for the Observation resource's unique identifier |
| REF | String | Placeholder for the subject reference |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the `subject` field of an Observation resource, suggesting it's part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
3. The JSON structure is partial and would likely be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR Observation resource.
