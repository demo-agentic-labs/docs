### Observation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Observation resource structure with a focus element. The focus element contains a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Observation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another resource that is the focus of this Observation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Observation resource with a focus element |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Observation".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "focus" array with a single object containing a "reference" property.
5. Sets the "reference" value to the provided REF input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the Observation resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the reference to the focus resource |

## Notes
1. This template creates only a partial Observation resource, focusing on the "focus" element.
2. The structure follows the FHIR Observation resource format but only includes the "id" and "focus" fields.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the ID and reference to be dynamically inserted.
4. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project with multiple contributors.
