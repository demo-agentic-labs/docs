## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Observation resource with a `hasMember` relationship. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing an Observation that has a member reference to another resource.

### Observation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Observation resource with a `hasMember` relationship. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the reference to the member resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Observation resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the member resource |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR Observation resource with the following key elements:
- `resourceType`: Set to "Observation"
- `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
- `hasMember`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Observation".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to insert the resource's unique identifier.
4. It creates a `hasMember` array with a single object.
5. Within the `hasMember` object, it sets the `reference` property using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The `hasMember` array is structured to allow for multiple members, but this template only includes one. If multiple members are needed, the template would need to be modified to iterate over a collection of references.
3. The JSON structure uses trailing commas, which is not standard JSON but is often accepted by modern parsers and can make version control diffs cleaner when adding new properties.
