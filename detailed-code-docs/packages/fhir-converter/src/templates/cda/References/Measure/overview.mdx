## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR Measure resource structure with a focus on the `subjectReference` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format, specifically for creating a reference to the subject of a measure.

### Measure Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Measure resource. It specifically defines the `resourceType`, `id`, and `subjectReference` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Measure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the measure |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Measure resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Measure",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subjectReference": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Measure"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `subjectReference` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template creates only a partial Measure resource. In a complete FHIR Measure resource, there would typically be additional fields and nested structures.
4. The `subjectReference` in a FHIR Measure resource typically refers to a Group, Patient, or other resource that the measure is about. The exact nature of the reference would depend on the context in which this template is used.
