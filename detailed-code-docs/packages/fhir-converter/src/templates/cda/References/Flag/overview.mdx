## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Flag resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically designed to handle different aspects of a Flag resource such as author, encounter, and subject references.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR Flag resource. A Flag resource in FHIR is used to draw attention to a particular issue or state for a patient. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of Flag resources with specific references:

1. The author template creates a Flag resource with an author reference, indicating who created or last modified the flag.
2. The encounter template links a Flag resource to a specific healthcare encounter.
3. The subject template associates a Flag resource with a particular patient or group.

These templates can be used individually or combined to create a complete Flag resource, depending on the needs of the FHIR document being generated.

## Key Files
1. author.hbs: This template creates a partial Flag resource with an author reference. It takes an ID and a REF as inputs and generates a JSON structure with the author information.

2. encounter.hbs: This template generates a Flag resource linked to a specific encounter. It also takes an ID and a REF as inputs, creating a JSON structure that includes the encounter reference.

3. subject.hbs: This template produces a Flag resource with a subject reference. Like the others, it uses ID and REF inputs to create a JSON structure, this time focusing on the subject of the flag.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a nested JSON object with the "resourceType" set to "Flag" and including the specific reference (author, encounter, or subject) based on the template's purpose.

## Dependencies
These templates are part of the FHIR Converter project and rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to work within a larger system for converting between different healthcare data formats.

## Configuration
While these templates don't have explicit configuration files, they do use input variables that act as configuration options:

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| ID | The unique identifier for the Flag resource |
| REF | The reference to the author, encounter, or subject (depending on the template) |

These variables are used within the templates to populate the appropriate fields in the generated JSON structures.

Here's an example of how the author.hbs template might be used:

```handlebars
{{&gt; References/Flag/author ID="flag123" REF="Practitioner/practitioner456"}}
```

This would generate a JSON structure like:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Flag",
    "id": "flag123",
    "author": {
      "reference": "Practitioner/practitioner456"
    },
  }
}
```

The other templates (encounter.hbs and subject.hbs) would be used similarly, with the appropriate reference field being populated based on the template.

These templates are designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for easy integration into a larger FHIR document conversion process. They provide a standardized way to create partial Flag resources, ensuring consistency across the conversion system.
