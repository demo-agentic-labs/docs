### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Flag resource with an author reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Flag resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the author of the Flag |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A partial FHIR Flag resource with author information |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a nested "resource" object.
2. The "resource" object is defined as a FHIR Flag resource type.
3. The "id" field of the Flag resource is set using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. The "author" field is set as an object with a "reference" property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of dynamic values for the Flag's ID and author reference.
3. This template represents only a partial Flag resource. In a complete FHIR document, additional fields would likely be required for a fully valid Flag resource.
4. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which might need to be handled or removed in the final output depending on the requirements of the consuming system.
