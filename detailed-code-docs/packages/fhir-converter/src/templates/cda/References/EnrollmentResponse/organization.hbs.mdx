## High-level description

It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### EnrollmentResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EnrollmentResponse resource, which is part of the FHIR standard. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an organization reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EnrollmentResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the organization associated with the enrollment response |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an EnrollmentResponse resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "EnrollmentResponse",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "organization": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "EnrollmentResponse".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's unique identifier.
3. It creates an `organization` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the organization reference.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.
