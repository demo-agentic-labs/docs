### EnrollmentResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EnrollmentResponse FHIR resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reference to a request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the EnrollmentResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated request |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an EnrollmentResponse FHIR resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "EnrollmentResponse"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `request` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.
