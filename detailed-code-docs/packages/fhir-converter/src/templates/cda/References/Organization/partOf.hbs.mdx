### Organization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Organization resource with a 'partOf' relationship. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the organization's ID and the reference to its parent organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this organization |
| REF | String | The reference to the parent organization |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR Organization resource with the following structure:
- A 'resource' object containing:
  - 'resourceType' set to "Organization"
  - 'id' set to the provided ID
  - 'partOf' object with a 'reference' to the parent organization

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the 'resourceType' to "Organization".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the 'id' field.
3. It creates a 'partOf' object with a 'reference' field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder to set the reference to the parent organization.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that valid values will be provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders. If these are not provided or are invalid, it may result in an invalid or incomplete FHIR resource.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses FHIR's standard for representing organizational hierarchies through the 'partOf' relationship.
3. This template is likely part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources, possibly from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data, as suggested by the file path.
