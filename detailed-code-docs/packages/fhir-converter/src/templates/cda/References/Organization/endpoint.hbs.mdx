### Organization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing an Organization resource in FHIR format. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an endpoint reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Organization resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the endpoint associated with the Organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON representation of an Organization resource with an endpoint reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Organization"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `endpoint` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content (ID and REF placeholders).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license by Metriport Inc.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The JSON structure is not complete (it's wrapped in extra curly braces), suggesting that this template might be part of a larger JSON document or array.
