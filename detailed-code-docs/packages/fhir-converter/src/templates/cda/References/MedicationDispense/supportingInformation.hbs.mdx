## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicationDispense resource structure, specifically focusing on the `supportingInformation` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### MedicationDispense Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationDispense resource, specifically defining the `supportingInformation` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF | String | The reference to supporting information |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the MedicationDispense resource details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "MedicationDispense"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `supportingInformation`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` value into the `id` field of the resource.
2. It creates a `supportingInformation` array with a single object.
3. Within this object, it inserts the `REF` value into the `reference` field.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work within a Handlebars templating system, likely as part of a larger FHIR conversion framework.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically tailored for the `supportingInformation` field of a MedicationDispense resource, suggesting it's meant to be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
3. The structure allows for only one supporting information reference. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified or used multiple times.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be merged with other parts of the MedicationDispense resource in the full conversion process.
