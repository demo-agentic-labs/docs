## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicationDispense resource structure, specifically focusing on the location reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### MedicationDispense Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for a FHIR MedicationDispense resource, specifically defining the `location` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location where the medication was dispensed |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicationDispense",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "location": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationDispense".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's unique identifier.
3. The `location` field is populated with a `reference` sub-field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is designed to work within the Handlebars templating system.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial resource structure. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR MedicationDispense resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
