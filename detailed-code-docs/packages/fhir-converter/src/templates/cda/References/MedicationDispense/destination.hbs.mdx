### MedicationDispense Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for a FHIR MedicationDispense resource, specifically defining the `destination` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the destination of the medication dispense |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource with the following fields:
- `resourceType`: Always set to "MedicationDispense"
- `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
- `destination`: An object containing a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MedicationDispense".
2. It sets the `id` field using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. It creates a `destination` object within the resource, containing a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input variables provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a MedicationDispense resource, likely to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and ends with trailing commas, suggesting it's meant to be part of a larger JSON object.
