## High-level description

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource. It specifically populates the `substitution.responsibleParty` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the responsible party for the substitution |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure for a MedicationDispense resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationDispense".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. Within the `substitution` object, it creates a `responsibleParty` array with a single object.
5. The `reference` field of this object is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It may depend on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is focused on a very specific part of the MedicationDispense resource (substitution.responsibleParty), suggesting it's meant to be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete resource.
3. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which are not standard in JSON. This might be intentional if the output is meant to be part of a larger JSON structure or if it's processed further before final use.
4. The template doesn't include any conditional logic or loops, indicating it's designed for straightforward, one-to-one mapping of data.
