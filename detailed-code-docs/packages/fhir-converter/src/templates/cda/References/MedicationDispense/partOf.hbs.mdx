### MedicationDispense Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationDispense resource. It includes the `resourceType`, `id`, and `partOf` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this MedicationDispense resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another resource that this MedicationDispense is part of |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial MedicationDispense resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationDispense"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `partOf` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template only defines a partial resource structure. In a complete FHIR resource, there would likely be additional fields and possibly nested resources.
3. The `partOf` field is used to link this MedicationDispense to another resource, which could be useful in scenarios where the dispense is part of a larger process or event.
