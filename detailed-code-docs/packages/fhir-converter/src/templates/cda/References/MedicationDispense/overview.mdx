## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of a FHIR MedicationDispense resource. These templates are designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different sections of a FHIR MedicationDispense resource. Each template focuses on a specific field or set of fields within the MedicationDispense resource, such as the authorizing prescription, context, destination, detected issues, event history, location, medication reference, performer, receiver, status reason, subject, and supporting information. When combined, these templates allow for the construction of a complete MedicationDispense resource that represents information about a medication being provided to a patient.

## Key Files
1. `authorizingPrescription.hbs`: Defines the structure for the authorizing prescription reference.
2. `context.hbs`: Creates the context field, which references the encounter or episode of care related to the medication dispense.
3. `destination.hbs`: Specifies the destination where the medication was sent.
4. `detectedIssue.hbs`: Includes references to any issues detected during the medication dispense process.
5. `eventHistory.hbs`: Provides a history of events related to the medication dispense.
6. `location.hbs`: Indicates the location where the medication was dispensed.
7. `medicationReference.hbs`: References the medication that was dispensed.
8. `performer.actor.hbs`: Specifies the actor who performed the medication dispense.
9. `receiver.hbs`: Identifies the person who received the medication.
10. `statusReasonReference.hbs`: Provides a reference to the reason for the current status of the medication dispense.
11. `subject.hbs`: Identifies the patient who is the subject of the medication dispense.
12. `substitution.responsibleParty.hbs`: Specifies the responsible party for any medication substitution.
13. `supportingInformation.hbs`: Includes references to additional supporting information for the medication dispense.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a partial JSON object that represents a specific part of the MedicationDispense resource. They use Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values (typically `ID` and `REF`) into the appropriate fields.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely with additional dependencies and configuration options not visible in these individual files.

## Configuration
While the individual templates don't include specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of input variables (typically `ID` and `REF`). The actual configuration and orchestration of these templates would be handled by the larger FHIR conversion system they are part of.

In conclusion, this directory contains a set of modular templates that, when used together, can construct a comprehensive FHIR MedicationDispense resource. This modular approach allows for flexibility and easier maintenance of the conversion process from CDA to FHIR format.
