## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicationDispense resource structure, specifically focusing on the `statusReasonReference` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

## Symbols

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationDispense resource, specifically including the `statusReasonReference` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF | string | The reference value for the statusReasonReference |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationDispense".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `statusReasonReference` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be part of a larger templating system, likely with its own configuration mechanisms.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would typically be managed by the surrounding templating system or the application using this template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a MedicationDispense resource, focusing only on the `statusReasonReference` field. It would likely be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and would need to be combined with other data to form a valid FHIR MedicationDispense resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates Handlebars variable interpolation, where these values would be provided when the template is rendered.
