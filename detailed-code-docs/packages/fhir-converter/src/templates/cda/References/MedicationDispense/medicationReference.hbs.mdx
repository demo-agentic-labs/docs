### MedicationDispense Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MedicationDispense resource with a medicationReference. It's a partial template, likely to be used as part of a larger FHIR document construction process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the medication being dispensed |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a "resource" object with "resourceType" set to "MedicationDispense".
2. Sets the "id" of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}`.
3. Creates a "medicationReference" object with a "reference" field set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the input variables `ID` and `REF` to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it generates a part of a FHIR API resource. The structure follows the FHIR specification for MedicationDispense resources, specifically the medicationReference field.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | string | Always set to "MedicationDispense" |
| id | string | Unique identifier for this MedicationDispense resource |
| medicationReference | object | Contains a reference to the medication being dispensed |

Note: This template appears to be a partial representation of a MedicationDispense resource and would likely be combined with other templates to form a complete FHIR resource.
