### MedicationDispense Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource with a focus on the `context` field. It sets up the basic structure of the resource and includes placeholders for the resource ID and the context reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the context in which the medication was dispensed |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationDispense"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the resource's `id` field
3. Creates a `context` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
2. The file includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but has been modified by Metriport Inc.
3. The template only defines a partial resource structure. In a complete implementation, additional fields would likely be included in the MedicationDispense resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where dynamic content should be inserted when the template is rendered.
