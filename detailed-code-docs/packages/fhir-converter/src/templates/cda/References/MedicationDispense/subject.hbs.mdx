### MedicationDispense Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource, focusing on the `subject` field. It sets up the basic structure of the resource and includes placeholders for the resource ID and subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the medication dispense |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial MedicationDispense resource with the following fields:
- `resourceType`: Set to "MedicationDispense"
- `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
- `subject`: An object containing a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
