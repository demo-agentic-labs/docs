### MedicationDispense Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationDispense resource, focusing on the eventHistory element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |

| REF | String | A reference to an event in the medication dispense history |

#### Outputs

#### Internal Logic

2. Sets the "resourceType" to "MedicationDispense".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates an "eventHistory" array with a single object containing a "reference" field.
5. The "reference" field is populated with the provided REF value.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
- The eventHistory array is hardcoded to contain only one event reference. If multiple event references are needed, the template would need to be modified to handle an array of references.
- The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger FHIR resource, as indicated by the trailing commas and the nested structure.
