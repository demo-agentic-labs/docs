## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource structure, specifically focusing on the performer's actor information. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

## Symbols

### MedicationDispense Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource with a focus on the performer's actor information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationDispense resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the actor performing the medication dispense |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationDispense resource with the performer's actor information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a MedicationDispense resource structure.
2. Sets the resourceType to "MedicationDispense".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the resource.
4. Creates a performer array with a single object.
5. Within the performer object, creates an actor object with a reference field.
6. Assigns the provided REF value to the actor's reference.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be combined with other partial templates to form a complete FHIR MedicationDispense resource.
4. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) for variable substitution.
