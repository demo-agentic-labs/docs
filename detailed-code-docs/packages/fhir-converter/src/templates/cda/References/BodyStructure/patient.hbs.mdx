## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a FHIR BodyStructure resource, specifically focusing on the patient reference. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a BodyStructure resource with a patient reference.

### BodyStructure Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR BodyStructure resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the BodyStructure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this BodyStructure |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON representation of a FHIR BodyStructure resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "BodyStructure"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a BodyStructure resource, focusing only on the patient reference. It may be used as part of a larger template or system that constructs complete FHIR resources.
3. The output JSON structure is nested within `resource` and `patient` objects, which suggests it might be designed to be included in a larger FHIR Bundle or other containing structure.
