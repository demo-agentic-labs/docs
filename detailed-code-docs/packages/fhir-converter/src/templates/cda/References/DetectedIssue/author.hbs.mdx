## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for the `author` field of a FHIR `DetectedIssue` resource. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR `DetectedIssue` resource, focusing on the `author` field. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the DetectedIssue resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the author of the DetectedIssue |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A partial FHIR DetectedIssue resource with the author field populated |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "DetectedIssue".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates an `author` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a file named `author.hbs`, suggesting it's specifically for handling the author information of a DetectedIssue resource.
2. The file includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial resource structure, focusing on the `author` field. It's likely used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
4. The use of Handlebars (`.hbs` file extension) allows for dynamic content insertion, making this template reusable for different DetectedIssue instances.
