## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various components of FHIR DetectedIssue resources. These templates are part of a FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the DetectedIssue resource, such as author, evidence, implicated resources, mitigation, and patient references.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of FHIR DetectedIssue resources. A DetectedIssue in FHIR represents a potential issue detected during the provision of care, such as drug interactions, contraindications, or clinical concerns. The templates in this directory allow for the dynamic generation of different parts of a DetectedIssue resource, including:

1. Specifying the author of the detected issue
2. Providing evidence details related to the issue
3. Referencing implicated resources (e.g., medications or conditions involved)
4. Indicating the author of any mitigation strategies
5. Linking the detected issue to a specific patient

By using these templates, developers can easily generate FHIR-compliant JSON structures for DetectedIssue resources, ensuring consistency and adherence to the FHIR specification while converting data from CDA format.

## Key Files
1. `author.hbs`: Generates the author field of a DetectedIssue resource.
2. `evidence.detail.hbs`: Creates the evidence details for a DetectedIssue.
3. `implicated.hbs`: Specifies resources implicated in the detected issue.
4. `mitigation.author.hbs`: Defines the author of mitigation strategies for the issue.
5. `patient.hbs`: Links the DetectedIssue to a specific patient.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a partial JSON object that represents a specific aspect of the DetectedIssue resource. They all use Handlebars syntax to allow for dynamic content insertion.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated with other components that handle the overall conversion process from CDA to FHIR format.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders. The main configurable elements across these templates are:

1. `{{ID}}`: Used to set the unique identifier for the DetectedIssue resource.
2. `{{REF}}`: Used to specify references to other resources (e.g., author, patient, implicated resources).

These placeholders allow the templates to be reused for different instances of DetectedIssue resources, with the specific values provided at runtime during the conversion process.

Here's an example of how the `author.hbs` template structures its output:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "DetectedIssue",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "author": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
}
```

This structure is consistent across the templates, with variations in the specific fields populated (e.g., `evidence`, `implicated`, `mitigation`, `patient`).

It's important to note that these templates generate partial resources, focusing on specific aspects of a DetectedIssue. In a complete FHIR conversion process, these partial resources would likely be combined or nested within larger structures to create full, valid FHIR resources or bundles.

The use of these modular templates allows for flexibility in the conversion process, enabling developers to selectively include or exclude certain aspects of the DetectedIssue resource based on the available data in the source CDA documents.
