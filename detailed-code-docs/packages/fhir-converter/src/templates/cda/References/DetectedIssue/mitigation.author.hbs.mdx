### DetectedIssue Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR DetectedIssue resource with a single mitigation author reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DetectedIssue resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the author of the mitigation |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR DetectedIssue resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the FHIR resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "DetectedIssue"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `mitigation`: An array containing a single mitigation object
    - `author`: An object containing a reference to the mitigation author

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure.
2. The `mitigation` array contains a single object with an `author` property, which includes a `reference` to the mitigation author.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR conversion processes.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is used.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it generates a FHIR-compliant JSON structure that could be used in API responses or for data storage.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
