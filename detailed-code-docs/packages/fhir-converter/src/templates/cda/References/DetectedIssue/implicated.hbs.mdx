## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for a FHIR DetectedIssue resource, specifically focusing on the "implicated" field. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a DetectedIssue with an implicated reference.

### DetectedIssue Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DetectedIssue resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an implicated array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DetectedIssue resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the implicated resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR DetectedIssue resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "DetectedIssue"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `implicated` array with a single object containing a `reference` field
4. The `reference` field is populated with the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the DetectedIssue resource.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to FHIR.
3. The `implicated` array in the DetectedIssue resource is designed to contain references to other resources that are involved in the detected issue. In this template, it's set up to include a single reference.
4. The JSON structure includes nested "resource" objects, which might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction structure.
