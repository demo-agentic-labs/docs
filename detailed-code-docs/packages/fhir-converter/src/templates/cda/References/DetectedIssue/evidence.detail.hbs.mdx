### DetectedIssue Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DetectedIssue resource. It includes an ID and an evidence array with a single detail reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DetectedIssue resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the evidence detail |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR DetectedIssue resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "DetectedIssue"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates an "evidence" array with a single object
5. Within the evidence object, creates a "detail" array with a single object
6. Sets the "reference" property of the detail object to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to be called with context providing values for ID and REF. The resulting JSON structure adheres to the FHIR DetectedIssue resource specification.
