## High-level description

### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a "for" field that contains a reference to the subject of the task.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the subject of the task |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Task",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "for": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Task".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the `id` field.
3. The `for` field is populated with a `reference` object containing the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that valid values will be provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license by Metriport Inc.
2. The structure of the Task resource in this template is minimal, including only the essential fields. In a real-world scenario, a Task resource might include additional fields such as status, intent, priority, and others as defined in the FHIR specification.
3. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for Handlebars placeholders, which will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.
