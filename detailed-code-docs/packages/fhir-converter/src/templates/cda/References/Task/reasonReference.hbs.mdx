### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reasonReference field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Task",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "reasonReference": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Task".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the Task resource.
3. It creates a `reasonReference` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
3. The reasonReference field in a FHIR Task resource typically points to a resource that explains why this task needs to be (or has been) performed.
