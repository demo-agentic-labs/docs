## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR Task resources with various references and properties. These templates are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format.

## What does it do?
These templates create JSON structures representing different aspects of FHIR Task resources. Each template focuses on a specific field or relationship within a Task, such as:

1. The task's base (basedOn)
2. Associated encounter
3. Focus of the task
4. Subject of the task (for)
5. Input and output references
6. Insurance information
7. Location
8. Owner
9. Parent task (partOf)
10. Reason for the task
11. Relevant history
12. Requester
13. Restriction recipients

These templates allow for flexible generation of Task resources with different properties, enabling the conversion system to create appropriate FHIR representations based on the input CDA data.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Creates a Task with a reference to another resource it's based on.
2. `encounter.hbs`: Links a Task to a specific healthcare encounter.
3. `focus.hbs`: Sets the focus of the Task, typically referencing another resource.
4. `for.hbs`: Specifies the subject of the Task.
5. `input.valueReference.hbs` and `output.valueReference.hbs`: Define input and output references for the Task.
6. `insurance.hbs`: Associates insurance information with the Task.
7. `location.hbs`: Specifies the location related to the Task.
8. `owner.hbs`: Sets the owner of the Task.
9. `partOf.hbs`: Indicates that the Task is part of another Task.
10. `reasonReference.hbs`: Provides a reference to the reason for the Task.
11. `relevantHistory.hbs`: Links to relevant historical information.
12. `requester.hbs`: Specifies who requested the Task.
13. `restriction.recipient.hbs`: Defines restrictions on who can receive or access the Task.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely interacting with other components that provide the necessary context and data for rendering.

## Configuration
Each template uses a similar configuration pattern, typically expecting two main inputs:
1. `ID`: A unique identifier for the Task resource.
2. `REF`: A reference to another resource, the specific meaning of which depends on the template (e.g., owner reference, insurance reference, etc.).

These inputs are used as placeholders (e.g., `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) within the templates and are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered.

The templates don't include explicit configuration options beyond these inputs, suggesting that any additional configuration or customization would be handled by the broader conversion system they're part of.
