### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource. The template focuses on creating the 'partOf' relationship of the Task.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the resource that this Task is part of |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with 'partOf' relationship |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a 'resource' property.
2. Sets the 'resourceType' to "Task".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the 'id' field.
4. Creates a 'partOf' array with a single object containing a 'reference' field.
5. The 'reference' field is populated with the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
