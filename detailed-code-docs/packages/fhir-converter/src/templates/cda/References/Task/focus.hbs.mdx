## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Task resource with a focus reference. It's designed to generate a JSON structure representing a Task resource with a specific focus, which is likely a reference to another FHIR resource.

### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a focus reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the focus of the Task |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Task"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `focus` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | String | Always set to "Task" |
| id | String | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| focus.reference | String | A reference to the focus of the Task |

This template is likely part of a larger system for generating FHIR resources from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data. It specifically handles the creation of a Task resource with a focus reference, which could be used to link the Task to another relevant resource in the FHIR ecosystem.
