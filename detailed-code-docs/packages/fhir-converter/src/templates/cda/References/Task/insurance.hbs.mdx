### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource. It includes an `id` field and an `insurance` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurance resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with insurance reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "Task".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. An `insurance` array is created with a single object containing a `reference` property.
5. The `reference` property is set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars rendering engine. To use it, you would typically pass an object with `ID` and `REF` properties:

```javascript
const context = {
  ID: "unique-task-id",
  REF: "Insurance/insurance-resource-id"
};
const result = template(context);
```

The resulting `result` would be a string containing the JSON structure for the Task resource.
