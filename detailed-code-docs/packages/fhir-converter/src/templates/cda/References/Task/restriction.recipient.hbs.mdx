### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Task resource with a restriction recipient. It sets up the basic structure of a Task resource and includes a restriction field with a recipient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the recipient of the restriction |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the Task resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Task"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Task
  - `restriction`: Contains the restriction information
    - `recipient`: An array of recipients
      - `reference`: The reference to the recipient

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the resource type as "Task".
2. It sets the `id` of the Task using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. Under the `restriction` field, it creates a `recipient` array with a single object.
4. The recipient object contains a `reference` field, populated with the `{{REF}}` input.

## Notes
- This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format.
- The template focuses specifically on the restriction recipient aspect of a Task resource, which is useful for defining who has access to or can receive the task.
- The structure follows the FHIR specification for Task resources, particularly the restriction and recipient fields.
- The template uses minimal Handlebars syntax, primarily for inserting the `ID` and `REF` values.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger Handlebars-based templating system used for FHIR conversions. It would depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Templating engine used to render the JSON structure |
