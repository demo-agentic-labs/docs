## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Task resource with a `basedOn` property. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a Task that is based on another resource.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource. The template focuses on creating the `basedOn` property of the Task, which references another resource that this Task is based on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the resource that this Task is based on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with a `basedOn` property |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` of the resource to "Task".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` property of the Task.
4. Creates a `basedOn` array with a single object containing a `reference` property.
5. Sets the `reference` property to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses two input variables:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ID | string | N/A | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | string | N/A | The reference to the resource that this Task is based on |

## Error Handling
The template doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It's likely used in conjunction with other templates and scripts to generate complete FHIR resources. The specific API for using this template would depend on the broader system it's integrated into.

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the resource that this Task is based on |

| Output | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with a `basedOn` property |
