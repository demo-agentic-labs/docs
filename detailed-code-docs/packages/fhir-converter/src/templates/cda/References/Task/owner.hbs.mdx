### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource, focusing specifically on the owner property.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the owner of the Task |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with owner information |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Task".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. It creates an `owner` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the Task resource.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## TODOs
The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, which covers both the original Microsoft copyright and the subsequent Metriport Inc. copyright. This notice should be retained in any use or modification of the file.
