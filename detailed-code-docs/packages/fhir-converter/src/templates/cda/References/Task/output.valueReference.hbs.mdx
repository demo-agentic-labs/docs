## High-level description
This Handlebars template generates a FHIR Task resource with an output that contains a valueReference. The template is designed to create a specific structure for a Task resource, focusing on the output section with a reference value.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This Handlebars template defines the structure of a FHIR Task resource with an output containing a valueReference. It uses two placeholders, `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`, which are expected to be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the output's valueReference |

#### Outputs
The template generates a JSON structure representing a FHIR Task resource with the following main components:
- resourceType: "Task"
- id: The provided ID
- output: An array containing a single object with a valueReference

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts with a copyright notice and licensing information.
2. It then defines the JSON structure for the Task resource.
3. The `{{ID}}` placeholder is used to set the id of the Task resource.
4. The `output` array contains a single object with a `valueReference` property.
5. The `{{REF}}` placeholder is used to set the reference value within the valueReference object.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) will be provided with valid values when the template is used.

## Notes
- The template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
- The structure follows the FHIR specification for Task resources, specifically focusing on the output element with a valueReference.
- The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and reference values to be used for different Task resources.
