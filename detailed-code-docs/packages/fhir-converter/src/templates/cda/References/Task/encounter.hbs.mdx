#### Inputs

| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs

| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant Task resource with encounter reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Task"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates an "encounter" object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template expects two input variables to be provided when rendered:

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| ID | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | The reference to the associated encounter |
