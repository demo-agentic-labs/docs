## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Task resource with a focus on the `requester` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format, specifically for creating a Task resource with a requester reference.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Task resource. The template focuses on setting the `requester` field of the Task resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the requester of the task |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a partial FHIR Task resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure with a `resource` object.
2. Within the `resource` object, it sets:
   - `resourceType` to "Task"
   - `id` to the value of the `{{ID}}` placeholder
   - `requester` object with a `reference` field set to the value of the `{{REF}}` placeholder

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and helpers to generate complete FHIR resources.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the input placeholders `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself but is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It would be used as a partial template within that system to generate the requester part of a Task resource.
