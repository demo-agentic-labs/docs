### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a location reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location associated with the Task |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with location information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Task"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `location` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the Task resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the location reference |

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger FHIR resource bundle or document.
3. The template uses minimal formatting, which might be intentional for compactness or could be expanded for better readability if needed.
