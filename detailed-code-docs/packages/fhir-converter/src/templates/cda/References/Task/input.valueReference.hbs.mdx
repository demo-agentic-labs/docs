### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a FHIR Task resource with a specific input. The Task resource includes an id and an input array with a single element containing a valueReference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the input's valueReference |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Task",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "input": [
            {
                "valueReference": {
                    "reference": "{{REF}}"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Task".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field.
3. It creates an `input` array with a single object.
4. Within the input object, it sets a `valueReference` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) and generate the final JSON structure.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The template is specifically designed for creating a Task resource with a single input containing a valueReference, which could be used to link the Task to another FHIR resource.
- The JSON structure is not closed with a final curly brace, suggesting that this template might be part of a larger structure or could be extended with additional properties.
