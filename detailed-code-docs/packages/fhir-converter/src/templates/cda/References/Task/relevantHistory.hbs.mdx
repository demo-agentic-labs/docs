### Task Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Task resource, focusing on the relevantHistory field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Task resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the relevant history item |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Task resource with relevantHistory |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Task"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "relevantHistory" array with a single object containing a "reference" field
5. The "reference" field is populated with the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The structure of the JSON output follows the FHIR specification for Task resources, specifically focusing on the relevantHistory field.
4. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and references to be passed in for each use.
