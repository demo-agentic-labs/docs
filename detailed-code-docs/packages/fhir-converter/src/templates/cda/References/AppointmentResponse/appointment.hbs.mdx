### AppointmentResponse Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for an AppointmentResponse resource, which is part of the FHIR standard. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reference to the associated appointment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the AppointmentResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated appointment |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing an AppointmentResponse resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "AppointmentResponse"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `appointment` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input variables (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | String | Always set to "AppointmentResponse" |
| id | String | Unique identifier for the AppointmentResponse resource |
| appointment.reference | String | Reference to the associated appointment |

Note: This template is part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR resources. It specifically handles the creation of AppointmentResponse resources, which are typically used to represent a response to a scheduled appointment in healthcare systems.
