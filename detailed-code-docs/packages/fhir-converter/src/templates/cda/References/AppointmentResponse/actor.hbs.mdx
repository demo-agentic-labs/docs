### AppointmentResponse Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for an AppointmentResponse resource in FHIR format. It includes the resourceType, id, and actor fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the AppointmentResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the actor involved in the appointment response |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing an AppointmentResponse resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "AppointmentResponse"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `actor` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
3. The output JSON structure is nested within `resource` and `actor` objects, suggesting it might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or used in a specific context within the converter system.
