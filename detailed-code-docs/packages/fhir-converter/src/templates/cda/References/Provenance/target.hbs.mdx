### Provenance Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Provenance resource. The Provenance resource provides information about the creation, modification, or deletion of a resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Provenance resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the target resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Provenance resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the Provenance resource details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Provenance"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Provenance resource
  - `target`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Provenance".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the Provenance resource.
3. In the `target` array, it creates an object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the Provenance resource in this template is minimal and may need to be expanded for more complex use cases. For instance, it only includes the `target` field, while a full Provenance resource might also include fields like `recorded`, `agent`, or `entity`.
3. The `target` array in this template only allows for a single reference. If multiple targets need to be supported, the template would need to be modified.
