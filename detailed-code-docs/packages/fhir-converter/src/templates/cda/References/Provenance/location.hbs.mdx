## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Provenance resource with a location reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Provenance Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Provenance resource with a location reference. The Provenance resource provides information about the entity and processes involved in producing or delivering a resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Provenance resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the location associated with this Provenance |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR Provenance resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Provenance",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "location": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Provenance".
2. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the Provenance resource.
3. It creates a `location` object within the Provenance resource, setting its `reference` to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It would be used as follows:

1. The system would identify the need to create a Provenance resource with location information.
2. It would prepare the necessary `ID` and `REF` values.
3. It would then render this template with those values to produce the FHIR Provenance resource JSON.

Note: The actual API for using this template would depend on the broader FHIR converter system in which it's implemented.
