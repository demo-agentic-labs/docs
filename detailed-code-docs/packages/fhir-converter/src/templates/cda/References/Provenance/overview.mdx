## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR Provenance resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific element of the Provenance resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR Provenance resource, which is used to track the origins, authorship, and history of healthcare data. They allow the FHIR converter to generate JSON structures for various Provenance elements such as:

1. An agent acting on behalf of another entity
2. The primary agent responsible for the provenance
3. The entity associated with the provenance
4. The location related to the provenance
5. The target resource of the provenance

By using these templates, the converter can flexibly construct Provenance resources tailored to different scenarios in healthcare data exchange and tracking.

## Key Files
1. `agent.onBehalfOf.hbs`: Creates a Provenance resource structure focusing on an agent acting on behalf of another entity.
2. `agent.who.hbs`: Generates a partial Provenance resource structure for the primary agent responsible for the provenance.
3. `entity.what.hbs`: Produces a Provenance resource structure with an entity reference.
4. `location.hbs`: Builds a Provenance resource structure including a location reference.
5. `target.hbs`: Constructs a basic Provenance resource structure with a target reference.

Each of these templates is designed to be used independently or combined to create a complete FHIR Provenance resource, depending on the specific requirements of the conversion process.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to work within the context of a larger FHIR converter system, likely with additional dependencies for handling the overall conversion process from CDA to FHIR.

The templates adhere to the FHIR specification, particularly the structure and requirements for Provenance resources in FHIR R4.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of input variables. Common inputs across the templates include:

- `ID`: A unique identifier for the Provenance resource
- `REF`: A reference to another entity, agent, or resource, depending on the specific template

These inputs are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered, allowing for dynamic generation of Provenance resource structures based on the source CDA data.

## Notes
1. All templates in this directory include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates generate partial JSON structures, which are likely meant to be combined or nested within larger FHIR resources or bundles.
3. The modular nature of these templates allows for flexible composition of Provenance resources, catering to various scenarios in healthcare data conversion and exchange.
4. While these templates provide the basic structure for Provenance resources, additional logic in the broader conversion system would be necessary to populate them with appropriate data from the source CDA documents.
5. The templates follow FHIR R4 structure for Provenance resources, focusing on specific elements like `agent`, `entity`, `location`, and `target`.

These templates play a crucial role in the CDA to FHIR conversion process, enabling the creation of standardized Provenance resources that capture important metadata about the origin and handling of healthcare information.
