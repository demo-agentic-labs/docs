## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR Provenance resource structure, specifically focusing on the `agent.who` element. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format, particularly for representing the agent responsible for the provenance of a resource.

### Provenance Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Provenance resource with a focus on the `agent.who` element. It's structured to be included as part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Provenance resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the agent (who) responsible for the provenance |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR Provenance resource with the `agent.who` element populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Provenance".
2. Sets the `id` of the Provenance resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. Defines an `agent` array with a single object.
4. Within the agent object, sets the `who` property with a `reference` to `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`).

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template only defines a partial Provenance resource, focusing on the `agent.who` element. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource or bundle.
3. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
4. The template uses a specific JSON structure that may be designed to integrate with other parts of the FHIR conversion system.
