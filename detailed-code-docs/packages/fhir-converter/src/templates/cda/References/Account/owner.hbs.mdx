### Account Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Account resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an owner reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Account resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the owner of the Account |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Account resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Account"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `owner` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` values when rendered.

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Account resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the owner of the Account |

The output is a JSON structure that can be incorporated into a larger FHIR resource bundle or used standalone as an Account resource.
