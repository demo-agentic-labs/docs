## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR Account resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter project, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific component of an Account resource, such as coverage, guarantor, owner, partOf relationship, and subject.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR Account resource. When used in the FHIR converter system, they allow for the flexible construction of Account resources based on input data from CDA documents. The templates handle various aspects of an account, including:

1. Coverage information
2. Guarantor party details
3. Account ownership
4. Hierarchical relationships between accounts
5. Subject of the account

By separating these concerns into individual templates, the system can generate Account resources with varying levels of detail depending on the available input data.

## Key Files
1. `coverage.coverage.hbs`: Generates the coverage field for an Account resource.
2. `guarantor.party.hbs`: Creates the guarantor party information for an Account.
3. `owner.hbs`: Defines the owner reference for an Account.
4. `partOf.hbs`: Establishes hierarchical relationships between Accounts.
5. `subject.hbs`: Specifies the subject of an Account resource.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

- They create a JSON object with a "resource" property.
- Set the "resourceType" to "Account".
- Include an "id" field populated by an input parameter.
- Add their specific field (e.g., coverage, guarantor, owner) with appropriate nested structures.

For example, the `owner.hbs` template generates a structure like this:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Account",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "owner": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine. They are part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely involving other components for parsing CDA documents, applying these templates, and assembling complete FHIR resources.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't define specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of input parameters. Each template typically accepts two main inputs:

1. `ID`: A unique identifier for the Account resource.
2. `REF`: A reference to another resource or entity, specific to each template's purpose.

These inputs allow the templates to be configured at runtime based on the source data being converted.

## Notes
1. The templates are part of a modular system, allowing for the construction of FHIR Account resources with varying levels of detail.
2. Error handling is not implemented within the templates themselves, suggesting that input validation and error management are handled at a higher level in the FHIR converter system.
3. The templates are designed to generate partial FHIR resources, which are likely combined or nested within larger structures to create complete, valid FHIR documents.
4. The copyright notices in each file indicate that this is part of a project by Metriport Inc., incorporating work originally from Microsoft Corporation, and is licensed under AGPLv3.
5. The templates demonstrate a clear separation of concerns, with each focusing on a specific aspect of the Account resource. This modular approach allows for easier maintenance and potential expansion of the conversion capabilities.
