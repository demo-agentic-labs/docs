### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Account resource with a guarantor party. It uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Account resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the guarantor party |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Account resource with a guarantor party |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Account".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "guarantor" array with a single object.
5. Within the guarantor object, creates a "party" object with a "reference" field.
6. Inserts the provided REF value into the "reference" field.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.
