### PaymentReconciliation Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource, specifically focusing on the `detail.request` field. It provides a skeleton for creating a PaymentReconciliation resource with a single detail item containing a request reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the request within the detail item |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "PaymentReconciliation"
  - `id`: The provided ID
  - `detail`: An array with a single item containing:
    - `request`: An object with a `reference` field set to the provided REF value

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure.
2. The `detail` array is hardcoded to contain only one item, focusing on the `request` field.
3. The `request` object within the detail item only includes the `reference` field.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license by Metriport Inc.
2. The template provides a partial representation of a PaymentReconciliation resource, focusing only on the `id` and `detail.request` fields. Other fields that might be required for a complete PaymentReconciliation resource are not included in this template.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and would need to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
