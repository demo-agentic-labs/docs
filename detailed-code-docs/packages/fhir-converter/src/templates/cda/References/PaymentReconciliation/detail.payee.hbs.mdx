## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial structure for a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource, specifically focusing on the `detail.payee` element. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for generating FHIR-compliant JSON representations of payment reconciliation data.

### PaymentReconciliation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource. It specifically defines the `detail.payee` element within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the payee |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial PaymentReconciliation resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "PaymentReconciliation"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `detail`: An array containing a single object with:
    - `payee`: An object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure.
2. The `detail` array contains a single object, which could potentially be expanded to include multiple detail entries in a more complete implementation.
3. The `payee` object within the detail only includes a `reference` property, which is set to the value of `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which processes the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be a partial implementation, focusing only on the `detail.payee` element of a PaymentReconciliation resource. In a complete FHIR implementation, additional elements would typically be included.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and would likely be combined with other templates or data to form a full FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource.
