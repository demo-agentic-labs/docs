## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource. These templates are designed to be used in a system that converts Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or section of the PaymentReconciliation resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different components of a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource. They provide a structured way to generate JSON representations of payment reconciliation data, including details about payees, requests, responses, responsible parties, submitters, payment issuers, and requestors. When combined and populated with actual data, these templates can produce a complete FHIR-compliant PaymentReconciliation resource.

## Key Files
1. `detail.payee.hbs`: Generates the `detail.payee` element of the PaymentReconciliation resource.
2. `detail.request.hbs`: Creates the `detail.request` element within the resource.
3. `detail.response.hbs`: Produces the `detail.response` element for the resource.
4. `detail.responsible.hbs`: Generates the `detail.responsible` field in the resource.
5. `detail.submitter.hbs`: Creates the `detail.submitter` element of the resource.
6. `paymentIssuer.hbs`: Produces the `paymentIssuer` field for the PaymentReconciliation resource.
7. `request.hbs`: Generates the top-level `request` field in the resource.
8. `requestor.hbs`: Creates the `requestor` field for the PaymentReconciliation resource.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "PaymentReconciliation",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "specificField": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
}
```

Where `specificField` is replaced by the relevant field name for each template (e.g., `payee`, `request`, `response`, etc.).

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering and variable substitution. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used in conjunction with other templates and conversion logic.

## Configuration
Each template uses two main configuration options:
1. `ID`: A string representing the unique identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource.
2. `REF`: A string containing the reference to the specific entity or resource related to the field being populated (e.g., payee, request, response, etc.).

These values are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered.

## Notes
1. These templates provide partial representations of a PaymentReconciliation resource. To create a complete resource, they would need to be combined with other templates or data.
2. The templates follow the FHIR specification for PaymentReconciliation resources, ensuring that the generated JSON structures are compliant with the FHIR standard.
3. Error handling and validation of input values (ID and REF) should be implemented in the code that uses these templates to ensure the generated JSON is valid and meets FHIR specifications.
4. The templates include comprehensive copyright and license notices, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
5. The use of CDA in the file path suggests these templates are part of a system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format, which is a common use case in healthcare data interoperability.
