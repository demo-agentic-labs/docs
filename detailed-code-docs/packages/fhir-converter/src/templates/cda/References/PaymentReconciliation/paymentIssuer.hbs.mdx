### PaymentReconciliation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource structure with the `paymentIssuer` field populated.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the payment issuer |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "PaymentReconciliation"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `paymentIssuer`: An object containing:
    - `reference`: A reference to the payment issuer

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentReconciliation"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `paymentIssuer` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the payment issuer |

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The template is designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from other formats (possibly CDA, given the file path) into FHIR-compliant resources.
- The structure follows the FHIR specification for PaymentReconciliation resources, focusing specifically on the payment issuer information.
