### PaymentReconciliation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource. It includes a single detail item with a response reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF | string | The reference value for the response within the detail item |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a PaymentReconciliation resource structure
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentReconciliation"
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
4. Creates a `detail` array with a single item
5. Within the detail item, creates a `response` object with a `reference` field
6. Assigns the provided `REF` value to the `reference` field

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input variables (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses the FHIR standard for healthcare data exchange, specifically for representing a PaymentReconciliation resource.
3. The structure is minimal, focusing only on the `detail` array with a single item containing a response reference. In a real-world scenario, a PaymentReconciliation resource might include additional fields and multiple detail items.
