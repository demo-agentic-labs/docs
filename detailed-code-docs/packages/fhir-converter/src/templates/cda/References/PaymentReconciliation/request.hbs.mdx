## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource with a focus on the 'request' field. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a PaymentReconciliation resource with minimal information, specifically the resource type, ID, and a reference to a request.

### PaymentReconciliation Template
#### Description
This Handlebars template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a request reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the request associated with this PaymentReconciliation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts with a copyright and license notice.
2. It then defines a JSON structure with the following hierarchy:
   - A top-level "resource" object
   - Inside "resource":
     - "resourceType" is set to "PaymentReconciliation"
     - "id" is set to the value of the `{{ID}}` placeholder
     - A "request" object containing a "reference" field set to the value of the `{{REF}}` placeholder

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template provides a minimal structure for a PaymentReconciliation resource. In a real-world scenario, additional fields might be required or optional depending on the specific use case and FHIR implementation guide being followed.
2. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for Handlebars placeholders, which will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.
3. The JSON structure is not complete (it's missing closing braces) which suggests this template might be part of a larger structure or meant to be combined with other templates.
4. Proper error handling and validation of the input values (ID and REF) should be implemented in the code that uses this template to ensure the generated JSON is valid and meets FHIR specifications.
