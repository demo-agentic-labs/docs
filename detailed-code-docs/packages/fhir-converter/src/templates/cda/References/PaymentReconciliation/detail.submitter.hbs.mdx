### PaymentReconciliation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a `detail` array with a `submitter` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the submitter |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing part of a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentReconciliation"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the resource's `id` field
3. Creates a `detail` array with a single object
4. Within the detail object, creates a `submitter` object with a `reference` field
5. Assigns the provided `REF` value to the `reference` field of the submitter

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the submitter |

## Notes
- This template appears to be part of a larger system for generating FHIR resources, specifically for PaymentReconciliation.
- The structure is partial, suggesting it might be combined with other templates or data to form a complete PaymentReconciliation resource.
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
