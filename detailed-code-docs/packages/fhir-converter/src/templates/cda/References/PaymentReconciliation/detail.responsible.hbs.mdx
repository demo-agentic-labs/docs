## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource structure, specifically focusing on the `detail.responsible` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

## Symbols

### PaymentReconciliation Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for a FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource. It specifically defines the `detail.responsible` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The identifier for the PaymentReconciliation resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the responsible entity |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR PaymentReconciliation resource with the `detail.responsible` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a PaymentReconciliation resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentReconciliation".
3. The `id` field is populated with the provided `{{ID}}` value.
4. Within the `detail` array, it creates an object with a `responsible` field.
5. The `responsible` field contains a `reference` property, which is set to the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR conversion processes.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the correct provision of `ID` and `REF` values when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and conversion logic.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The structure suggests that this template might be included or referenced by other templates to build a complete PaymentReconciliation resource.
4. The template only defines a partial resource structure, focusing solely on the `detail.responsible` field. Other parts of the PaymentReconciliation resource would need to be defined elsewhere for a complete representation.
