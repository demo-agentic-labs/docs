### ResearchSubject Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchSubject resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an individual reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchSubject resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the individual associated with the ResearchSubject |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR ResearchSubject resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ResearchSubject"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `individual` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the `.hbs` file and substitute the placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) with actual values.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a ResearchSubject resource, focusing only on the `individual` reference. It may be used as part of a larger template or system that constructs complete FHIR resources.
3. The JSON structure includes extra commas at the end of some objects, which might need to be handled or removed when processing the final output to ensure valid JSON.
