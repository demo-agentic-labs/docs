### ResearchSubject Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ResearchSubject resource with a consent reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and consent reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchSubject resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the consent resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant ResearchSubject resource with consent reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchSubject resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and consent reference.
3. The `resourceType` is set to "ResearchSubject".
4. The `consent` field contains a nested object with a `reference` property, which is populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is used.
