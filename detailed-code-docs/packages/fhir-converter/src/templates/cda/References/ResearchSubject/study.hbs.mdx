### ResearchSubject Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchSubject resource. It includes the resource type, an identifier, and a reference to the associated study.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ResearchSubject resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated study |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant ResearchSubject resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ResearchSubject"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `study` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The generated JSON structure is not a complete FHIR resource on its own, as it's wrapped in additional object layers (`resource` and an outer object). This suggests it might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or a custom wrapper structure.
3. The template uses minimal formatting, which is common in Handlebars templates to avoid unnecessary whitespace in the output.
