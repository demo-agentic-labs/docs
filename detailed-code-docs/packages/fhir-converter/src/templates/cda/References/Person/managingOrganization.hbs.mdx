### Person Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Person resource with a managingOrganization reference. It's structured to be part of a larger FHIR bundle or response.

#### Inputs

| ID | String | The identifier for the Person resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the managing organization |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Person resource with a managingOrganization reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a "resource" object with "resourceType" set to "Person"
2. Sets the "id" of the Person resource using the `{{ID}}` input
3. Defines a "managingOrganization" object with a "reference" field set to the `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies

## Logging

## API/Interface Reference
