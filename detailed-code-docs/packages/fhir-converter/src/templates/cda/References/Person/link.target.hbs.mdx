### Person Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Person resource with a link to another resource. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject values into predefined fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the Person resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the target resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR Person resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the Person resource
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "Person"
  - `id`: The identifier of the Person resource
  - `link`: An array containing a single link object
    - `target`: An object containing the reference to the linked resource

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Person".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the Person resource.
3. In the `link` array, it creates a single link object with a `target` property.
4. The `target` property contains a `reference` field, which is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, which processes the `{{}}` placeholders.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.
2. The template produces a partial FHIR resource structure. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource or bundle.
3. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which might need to be handled by the JSON parser used to process the output.
