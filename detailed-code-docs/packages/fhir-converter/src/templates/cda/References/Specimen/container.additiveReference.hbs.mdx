### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is the main (and only) template in the file. It generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Specimen resource with a container that has an additive reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the Specimen resource |
| REF | string | The reference for the additive in the container |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Specimen resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Specimen".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "container" array with a single object.
5. Within the container object, creates an "additiveReference" object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the Specimen resource.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## TODOs
The file includes a substantial copyright and license notice at the beginning, which covers both the original work by Microsoft Corporation and modifications by Metriport Inc. This notice should be preserved in any derivative works.
