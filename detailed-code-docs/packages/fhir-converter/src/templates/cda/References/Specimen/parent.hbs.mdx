## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating a FHIR Specimen resource with a parent reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for handling CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversions.

### Specimen Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Specimen resource with a parent reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and parent reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Specimen resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the parent Specimen resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Specimen resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the Specimen resource details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Specimen"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Specimen
  - `parent`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Specimen".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the Specimen resource.
3. It creates a `parent` array with a single object containing a `reference` property.
4. The `reference` property is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The overall system that uses this template for CDA to FHIR conversions |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the CDA to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure (`packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/Specimen/`).
3. The template follows the FHIR resource structure for Specimen, focusing specifically on the parent reference aspect.
4. This template is likely used in conjunction with other templates and processing logic to create complete FHIR resources during the conversion process.
