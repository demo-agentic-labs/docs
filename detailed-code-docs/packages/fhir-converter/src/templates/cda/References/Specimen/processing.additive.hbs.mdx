### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Specimen resource with processing additive information. It uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the Specimen resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the additive used in processing |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A structured JSON object representing a FHIR Specimen resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Specimen".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "processing" array with one object.
5. Within the processing object, creates an "additive" array with one object.
6. Sets the "reference" of the additive to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure with dynamic values.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID     | string | The identifier for the Specimen resource |
| REF    | string | The reference to the additive used in processing |

These options are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.
