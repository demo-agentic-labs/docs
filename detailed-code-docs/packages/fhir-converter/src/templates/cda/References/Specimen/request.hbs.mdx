### Specimen Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Specimen resource with a request reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and request reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Specimen resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the request associated with this specimen |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Specimen resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the Specimen resource details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Specimen"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Specimen
  - `request`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Specimen".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the Specimen resource.
3. It creates a `request` array with a single object containing a `reference` property.
4. The `reference` property is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine in the context of a FHIR converter system.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code.
