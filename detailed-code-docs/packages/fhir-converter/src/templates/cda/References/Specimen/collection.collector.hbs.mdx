## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for a FHIR Specimen resource, specifically focusing on the collector information within the collection details. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a Specimen resource with minimal information about the specimen collector.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is the main (and only) template in the file. It generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Specimen resource, focusing on the collector information within the collection details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the Specimen resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the collector of the specimen |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Specimen resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Specimen".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "collection" object within the resource.
5. Within "collection", creates a "collector" object.
6. Sets the "reference" of the collector to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely related to FHIR conversion) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template generates a minimal Specimen resource structure, focusing only on the collector information. In a real-world scenario, a Specimen resource might include additional properties and details.
3. The generated JSON structure is not complete and would typically be part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource collection.
4. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests that this might be part of a larger template or array of resources.
