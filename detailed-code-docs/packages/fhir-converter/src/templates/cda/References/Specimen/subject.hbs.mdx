## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating a FHIR Specimen resource with a subject reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for handling CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversions.

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure representing a FHIR Specimen resource with a subject reference. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values for the resource's ID and subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Specimen resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject of the specimen |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object structure representing a partial FHIR Specimen resource with the following properties:
- `resource`: An object containing the Specimen resource details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Specimen"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Specimen
  - `subject`: An object containing the reference to the subject

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Specimen".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to insert the Specimen's unique identifier.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder to insert the subject reference.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) section of the FHIR converter, suggesting it's used for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger FHIR resource bundle, as indicated by the trailing commas and the nested structure.
4. The template focuses solely on the `subject` property of the Specimen resource, suggesting that other properties might be handled in separate templates or processes.
