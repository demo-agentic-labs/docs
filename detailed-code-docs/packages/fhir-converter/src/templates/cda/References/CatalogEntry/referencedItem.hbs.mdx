## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a FHIR CatalogEntry resource, specifically focusing on the `referencedItem` field. It's designed to create a JSON representation of a CatalogEntry with a reference to another item.

### CatalogEntry Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR CatalogEntry resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reference to another item.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the CatalogEntry |
| REF | string | The reference to the item being cataloged |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A FHIR-compliant CatalogEntry resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "CatalogEntry"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `referencedItem` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
3. The output JSON structure is nested, with `resource` as the top-level key, suggesting it might be used as part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
4. The template only defines the basic structure of a CatalogEntry. In a real-world scenario, additional fields might be necessary to create a fully compliant and useful FHIR CatalogEntry resource.
