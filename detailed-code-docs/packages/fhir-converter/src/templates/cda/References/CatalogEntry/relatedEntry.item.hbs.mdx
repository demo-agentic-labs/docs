### CatalogEntry Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR CatalogEntry resource. It includes an ID and a single relatedEntry with a reference to another item.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the CatalogEntry resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the related item |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR CatalogEntry resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the CatalogEntry details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "CatalogEntry"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `relatedEntry`: An array containing a single object with an `item` property
    - `item`: An object with a `reference` property pointing to the related item

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a CatalogEntry resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "CatalogEntry".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
4. It creates a `relatedEntry` array with a single object.
5. Within the `relatedEntry` object, it creates an `item` object with a `reference` property.
6. The `reference` property uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder to set the reference to the related item.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and references to be used when generating CatalogEntry resources.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for CatalogEntry resources, focusing on the relatedEntry aspect.
4. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources, possibly from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data, as suggested by the file path.
