## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR CatalogEntry resources. These templates are part of a FHIR converter, specifically designed to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format. The templates focus on creating JSON representations of CatalogEntry resources with different reference structures.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory are used to generate standardized FHIR CatalogEntry resources. A CatalogEntry in FHIR is used to define an entry in a catalog, which can reference other items or related entries. These templates allow for the creation of two types of CatalogEntry resources:

1. A CatalogEntry with a direct reference to an item (referencedItem).
2. A CatalogEntry with a related entry that references another item (relatedEntry).

These templates take simple inputs like IDs and references, and transform them into structured JSON objects that comply with the FHIR specification for CatalogEntry resources. This process is crucial in healthcare data interoperability, allowing different systems to understand and exchange catalog information in a standardized format.

## Key Files

1. `referencedItem.hbs`: This template creates a CatalogEntry resource with a direct reference to an item. It takes an ID and a reference as inputs and generates a JSON structure with a `referencedItem` field.

2. `relatedEntry.item.hbs`: This template generates a CatalogEntry resource with a related entry. It also takes an ID and a reference as inputs but creates a JSON structure with a `relatedEntry` array containing an `item` with a reference.

Both templates follow a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "CatalogEntry",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    // Specific fields differ between templates
  }
}
```

The main difference lies in how they structure the reference:

- `referencedItem.hbs` uses:
  ```json
  "referencedItem": {
    "reference": "{{REF}}"
  }
  ```

- `relatedEntry.item.hbs` uses:
  ```json
  "relatedEntry": [
    {
      "item": {
        "reference": "{{REF}}"
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) and generate the final JSON structures. No specific versions are mentioned in the provided information.

## Notes
1. The templates include comprehensive copyright and license notices, indicating they are part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The templates are designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and references to be used when generating CatalogEntry resources.
3. While these templates provide the basic structure for CatalogEntry resources, in real-world scenarios, additional fields might be necessary to create fully compliant and useful FHIR CatalogEntry resources.
4. The output JSON structures are nested with `resource` as the top-level key, suggesting they might be used as part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
5. These templates appear to be part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources from CDA data, as suggested by the file paths.
