### ServiceRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a focus on the `supportingInfo` field. It provides a structure for including supporting information references in a ServiceRequest.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource with the `supportingInfo` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "ServiceRequest".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. The `supportingInfo` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` property, which is set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure allows for easy expansion to include multiple supporting information references if needed in the future.
3. This template is specifically for the `supportingInfo` field and would likely be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete ServiceRequest resource.
