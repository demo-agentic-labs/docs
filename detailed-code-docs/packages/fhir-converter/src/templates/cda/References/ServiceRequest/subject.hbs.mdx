### ServiceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource structure with a subject reference. It's likely part of a larger template system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the service request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource with the following fields:
- `resource`: An object containing the ServiceRequest details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ServiceRequest"
  - `id`: The identifier of the ServiceRequest
  - `subject`: An object containing a reference to the subject of the service request

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a ServiceRequest resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ServiceRequest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` input to set the reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
