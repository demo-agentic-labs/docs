### ServiceRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a location reference. It's structured to include the resource type, an ID, and a location reference array.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the location associated with the service request |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a location reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ServiceRequest"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `locationReference` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | string | Placeholder for the ServiceRequest resource ID |
| {{REF}} | string | Placeholder for the location reference |

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of the required ID and reference values.
3. The JSON structure is nested, with the actual ServiceRequest resource contained within a "resource" object. This suggests it might be used as part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
