### ServiceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with an insurance reference. It's a partial template that would likely be included in a larger FHIR document structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurance resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with an insurance reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "ServiceRequest".
3. It sets the "id" of the ServiceRequest using the provided `{{ID}}`.
4. It creates an "insurance" array with a single object containing a "reference" to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly.
