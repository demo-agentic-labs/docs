## High-level description

### ServiceRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource structure with an emphasis on the `performer` field. It's designed to be integrated into a larger FHIR document or used as part of a conversion process from CDA to FHIR.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer of the service request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "ServiceRequest".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the ServiceRequest.
4. The `performer` field is set as an array with a single object containing a `reference` property.
5. The `reference` property is populated with the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of input variables (`ID` and `REF`).

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of Metriport Inc.'s codebase.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. This template is specifically located in the path `packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/ServiceRequest/`, suggesting it's part of a larger FHIR conversion toolkit.
4. The template only defines a partial ServiceRequest resource, focusing on the `performer` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to create a complete FHIR ServiceRequest resource.
5. The use of Handlebars (indicated by the `.hbs` file extension and the `{{}}` syntax) allows for dynamic content insertion, making this template reusable for different ServiceRequest instances.
