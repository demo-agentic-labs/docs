## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a specimen reference. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### ServiceRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a specific focus on the specimen reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the specimen associated with this ServiceRequest |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the ServiceRequest
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "ServiceRequest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this ServiceRequest
  - `specimen`: An array containing a single object with a reference to the associated specimen

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ServiceRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` of the ServiceRequest.
3. In the `specimen` array, it creates an object with a `reference` property set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA to FHIR format. It likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON output |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input variables provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided correctly.

## TODOs
The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, which covers both the original Microsoft copyright and the subsequent Metriport Inc. copyright. This suggests that the code has been adapted or incorporated into a larger project by Metriport Inc. while maintaining the original licensing terms.
