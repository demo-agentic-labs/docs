### ServiceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a reasonReference field. The reasonReference is an array containing a single reference object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with the following structure:
- resource
  - resourceType: "ServiceRequest"
  - id: {{ID}}
  - reasonReference: An array with a single object containing a reference field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the resourceType to "ServiceRequest".
2. It assigns the provided {{ID}} to the id field.
3. It creates a reasonReference array with a single object containing a reference field, populated with the {{REF}} value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON output |

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values are provided correctly when the template is rendered.
