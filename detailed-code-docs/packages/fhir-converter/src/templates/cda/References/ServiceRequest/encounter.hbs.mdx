## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with an encounter reference. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### ServiceRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with an encounter reference. The ServiceRequest is a record of a request for a procedure, diagnostic investigation, or other service to be planned, proposed, or ordered.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ServiceRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "encounter": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ServiceRequest".
2. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the ServiceRequest.
3. It creates an `encounter` object within the ServiceRequest, setting its `reference` to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself but is likely used as part of a larger FHIR conversion API. The expected interface for using this template would be:

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ServiceRequest |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR ServiceRequest resource.
