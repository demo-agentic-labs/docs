This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a focus on the `relevantHistory` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### ServiceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource structure with a `relevantHistory` array containing a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the relevant history |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | Object | A partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource with `relevantHistory` |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "ServiceRequest".
2. Sets the `id` of the ServiceRequest to the provided `{{ID}}`.
3. Defines a `relevantHistory` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a ServiceRequest resource, focusing only on the `relevantHistory` field. It may be intended to be combined with other partial templates to form a complete ServiceRequest resource.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and ends with trailing commas, suggesting it might be part of a larger template or structure.
