### ServiceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a focus on the `requester` field. It's structured to be included in a larger FHIR resource compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ServiceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the requester of the service |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ServiceRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "ServiceRequest".
2. It sets the `id` of the ServiceRequest using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. The `requester` field is populated with a `reference` sub-field, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be flexible and used within larger template structures.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is licensed under AGPLv3, with additional permissions as stated in the notice.
3. The structure suggests this template is meant to be used as part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format, specifically for creating ServiceRequest resources.
4. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests this might be part of an array or a larger object in the full implementation.
