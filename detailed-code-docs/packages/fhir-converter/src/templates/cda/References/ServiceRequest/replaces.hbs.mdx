### ServiceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR ServiceRequest resource. It specifically focuses on the 'replaces' field, which indicates that this service request is replacing another one.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this ServiceRequest |
| REF | String | The reference to the ServiceRequest being replaced |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant ServiceRequest resource JSON object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a 'resource' object with 'resourceType' set to "ServiceRequest"
2. Sets the 'id' field to the provided `{{ID}}`
3. Creates a 'replaces' array with a single object containing a 'reference' field set to the provided `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The 'replaces' field is an array, suggesting that a ServiceRequest could potentially replace multiple other requests, although this template only includes one.
3. The JSON structure uses trailing commas, which is not standard JSON but is often accepted by modern parsers and can make version control diffs cleaner.
4. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a ServiceRequest, focusing only on the 'replaces' field. It may be intended to be combined with other partial templates to create a complete ServiceRequest resource.
