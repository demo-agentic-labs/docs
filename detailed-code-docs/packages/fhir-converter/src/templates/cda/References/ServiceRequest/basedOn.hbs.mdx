### ServiceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ServiceRequest resource with a `basedOn` property. The `basedOn` property indicates that this service request is based on another referenced resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for this ServiceRequest resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the resource that this ServiceRequest is based on |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR ServiceRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "ServiceRequest".
2. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. It creates a `basedOn` array with a single object containing a `reference` property set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that valid values will be provided for ID and REF.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON output follows the FHIR specification for a ServiceRequest resource.
3. The `basedOn` property is an array, suggesting that a ServiceRequest could potentially be based on multiple references, although this template only includes one.
4. The comma after the `reference` object in the `basedOn` array and after the `basedOn` property itself might need to be removed depending on how this template is used in a larger context, as trailing commas can cause issues in some JSON parsers.
