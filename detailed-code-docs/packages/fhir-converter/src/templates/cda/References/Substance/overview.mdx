### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Substance resource. It focuses on the `ingredient` field, which contains a reference to another substance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Substance resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another substance that serves as an ingredient |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR Substance resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Substance"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `ingredient`: An array with a single object containing:
    - `substanceReference`: An object with a `reference` field pointing to another substance

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts with a copyright and license notice in a Handlebars comment block.
2. It then defines the JSON structure for the Substance resource.
3. The `ID` placeholder is used to set the resource's `id`.
4. The `ingredient` array is created with a single object.
5. Within this object, `substanceReference` is defined with a `reference` field.
6. The `REF` placeholder is used to set the value of the `reference` field.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the ID and REF placeholders when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this template expects two inputs to be provided when rendered:

| Placeholder | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| {{ID}} | The unique identifier for the Substance resource |
| {{REF}} | The reference to another substance that serves as an ingredient |

These placeholders should be replaced with actual values when the template is processed by the Handlebars engine.
