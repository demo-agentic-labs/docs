### MedicinalProductManufactured Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProductManufactured resource in the FHIR standard. It includes basic information about the resource type, an ID, and a manufacturer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this MedicinalProductManufactured resource |
| REF | String | A reference to the manufacturer |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a MedicinalProductManufactured resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Within the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" to "MedicinalProductManufactured"
   - "id" to the provided `{{ID}}`
   - "manufacturer" as an array with a single object containing a "reference" property set to `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON conforms to the FHIR standard for MedicinalProductManufactured resources.
3. The manufacturer information is limited to a single reference. If multiple manufacturers need to be represented, the template would need to be modified.
4. The template uses minimal formatting and doesn't include any conditional logic, suggesting it's designed for a specific use case where only the ID and manufacturer reference are required.
