## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR MedicinalProductManufactured resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. The templates focus on two specific aspects of the MedicinalProductManufactured resource: ingredients and manufacturers.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory are used to create standardized JSON structures that represent MedicinalProductManufactured resources in the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. These resources are used to describe manufactured medicinal products in healthcare systems.

1. The ingredient template creates a JSON structure that includes an identifier for the medicinal product and a reference to an ingredient used in its manufacture.
2. The manufacturer template creates a similar JSON structure, but instead of an ingredient, it includes a reference to the manufacturer of the medicinal product.

These templates allow for the consistent and standardized representation of medicinal product information, which is crucial for interoperability in healthcare systems.

## Key Files
1. `ingredient.hbs`: This template generates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProductManufactured resource with focus on the ingredient information. It includes:
   - Resource type specification
   - An ID field
   - An ingredient reference

   Example usage:
   ```handlebars
   {{&gt; MedicinalProductManufactured/ingredient ID="12345" REF="Ingredient/67890"}}
   ```

   This would generate:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "MedicinalProductManufactured",
       "id": "12345",
       "ingredient": [
         {
           "reference": "Ingredient/67890"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. `manufacturer.hbs`: This template generates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProductManufactured resource with focus on the manufacturer information. It includes:
   - Resource type specification
   - An ID field
   - A manufacturer reference

   Example usage:
   ```handlebars
   {{&gt; MedicinalProductManufactured/manufacturer ID="54321" REF="Organization/98765"}}
   ```

   This would generate:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "MedicinalProductManufactured",
       "id": "54321",
       "manufacturer": [
         {
           "reference": "Organization/98765"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

## Dependencies
Both templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}). The templates are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, which would provide the necessary context and data for rendering these templates.

## Notes
1. Both templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates are minimalistic, focusing only on specific aspects of the MedicinalProductManufactured resource. In a real-world scenario, these resources might include additional properties.
3. The templates assume that the ID and REF values will be provided dynamically when rendered.
4. These templates do not include error handling or validation. It's assumed that the larger system using these templates would handle data validation and error cases.
5. The templates are designed for specific use cases where only the ID and a single reference (either ingredient or manufacturer) are required. For more complex scenarios, these templates would need to be expanded or combined.
