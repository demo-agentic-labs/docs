### MedicinalProductManufactured Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProductManufactured resource in FHIR format. It includes an ID and a single ingredient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the MedicinalProductManufactured resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the ingredient |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a MedicinalProductManufactured resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "MedicinalProductManufactured".
3. It assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. In the "ingredient" array, it adds a single object with a "reference" property, set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure is specifically tailored for the MedicinalProductManufactured resource type in FHIR.
3. The template only includes the "id" and a single "ingredient" reference. In a real-world scenario, a MedicinalProductManufactured resource might include additional properties.
4. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) suggests that these values are expected to be provided dynamically when the template is rendered.
