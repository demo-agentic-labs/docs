## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating EnrollmentRequest resources in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the EnrollmentRequest resource: candidate, coverage, insurer, and provider.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to generate JSON structures for EnrollmentRequest resources in FHIR format. They allow for the creation of standardized healthcare enrollment requests with references to various related entities:

1. The candidate template creates a reference to the person or patient for whom the enrollment is being requested.
2. The coverage template establishes a link to the specific coverage being requested.
3. The insurer template sets a reference to the insurance provider.
4. The provider template creates a reference to the healthcare provider associated with the enrollment request.

Each template takes an ID for the EnrollmentRequest resource and a reference (REF) to the specific entity it's dealing with (candidate, coverage, insurer, or provider). The system then uses these templates to generate FHIR-compliant JSON objects that can be used in healthcare information exchange and processing.

## Key Files

1. `candidate.hbs`: This template creates the JSON structure for the 'candidate' field of an EnrollmentRequest resource. It sets up a reference to the person or patient for whom the enrollment is being requested.

2. `coverage.hbs`: This template generates the JSON structure for the 'coverage' field of an EnrollmentRequest resource. It establishes a reference to the specific coverage being requested in the enrollment.

3. `insurer.hbs`: This template defines the JSON structure for the 'insurer' field of an EnrollmentRequest resource. It creates a reference to the insurance provider associated with the enrollment request.

4. `provider.hbs`: This template sets up the JSON structure for the 'provider' field of an EnrollmentRequest resource. It creates a reference to the healthcare provider associated with the enrollment request.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "EnrollmentRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "{{fieldName}}": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

Where `{{fieldName}}` is replaced by "candidate", "coverage", "insurer", or "provider" depending on the specific template.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}). They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from other formats (such as CDA) into FHIR-compliant JSON.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in these templates. They are designed to be used as part of a larger system where the ID and REF values are provided at runtime when the templates are rendered.

The templates assume that the necessary context (ID and REF values) will be provided correctly when they are used. There is no explicit error handling within the templates themselves, so it's important that the system using these templates ensures the correct inputs are provided.

These templates are minimal and focused, suggesting they might be used in conjunction with other templates to build more complex FHIR resources. The structure of each template adheres to the FHIR specification for EnrollmentRequest resources, focusing on specific fields within the resource.

It's worth noting that all files include a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating they're based on work by Microsoft but are now part of the Metriport Inc. project under the AGPLv3 license. This suggests that the templates are part of an open-source project that has evolved from earlier work by Microsoft.
