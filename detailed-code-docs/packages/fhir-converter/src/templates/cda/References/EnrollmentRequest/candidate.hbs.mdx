### EnrollmentRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EnrollmentRequest resource with a 'candidate' field.

#### Inputs

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a 'resource' object with 'resourceType' set to "EnrollmentRequest"
2. Sets the 'id' field using the provided `{{ID}}` input
3. Creates a 'candidate' object with a 'reference' field set to the provided `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of the Metriport Inc. project.
2. The template is designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from other formats into FHIR-compliant JSON.
3. The structure adheres to the FHIR specification for EnrollmentRequest resources, focusing specifically on the 'candidate' field.
4. The template is minimal and focused, suggesting it might be used in conjunction with other templates to build more complex FHIR resources.
