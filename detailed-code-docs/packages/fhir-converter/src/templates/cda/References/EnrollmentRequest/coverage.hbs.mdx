## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating an EnrollmentRequest resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It specifically focuses on the coverage reference within the EnrollmentRequest resource.

## Symbols

### EnrollmentRequest Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for an EnrollmentRequest resource with a coverage reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EnrollmentRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the coverage resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing an EnrollmentRequest resource with coverage reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "EnrollmentRequest"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "coverage" object with a "reference" property, using the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The resulting JSON structure is not complete and might be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle, as indicated by the comma at the end of the object.
