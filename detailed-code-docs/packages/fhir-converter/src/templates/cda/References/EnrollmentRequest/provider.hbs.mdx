### EnrollmentRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EnrollmentRequest resource, which is part of the FHIR standard. It specifically defines the provider information within the EnrollmentRequest.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EnrollmentRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the provider associated with this enrollment request |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an EnrollmentRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "EnrollmentRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "provider": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "EnrollmentRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` of the resource.
3. The `provider` field is populated with a `reference` object, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of |
