### EnrollmentRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EnrollmentRequest resource, which is part of the FHIR standard. It specifically defines the insurer field within the EnrollmentRequest.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EnrollmentRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurer |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an EnrollmentRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "EnrollmentRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "insurer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "EnrollmentRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the EnrollmentRequest.
3. The `insurer` field is set as an object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.
