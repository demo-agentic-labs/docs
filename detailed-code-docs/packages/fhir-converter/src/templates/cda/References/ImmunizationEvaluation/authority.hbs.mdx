### ImmunizationEvaluation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an ImmunizationEvaluation resource, including its resourceType, id, and authority reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ImmunizationEvaluation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the authority for the immunization evaluation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing an ImmunizationEvaluation resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ImmunizationEvaluation"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `authority` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content (ID and REF placeholders).

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the ImmunizationEvaluation resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the authority reference |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of an ImmunizationEvaluation resource, focusing solely on the `authority` field. It may be intended to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The JSON structure is not complete (it has trailing commas and is wrapped in extra curly braces), suggesting it might be a fragment meant to be integrated into a larger JSON object.
