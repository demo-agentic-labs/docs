## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating an ImmunizationEvaluation resource in FHIR format. It specifically focuses on setting up the patient reference within the ImmunizationEvaluation resource.

### ImmunizationEvaluation Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ImmunizationEvaluation resource with a focus on the patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ImmunizationEvaluation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this ImmunizationEvaluation |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR ImmunizationEvaluation resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the ImmunizationEvaluation details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ImmunizationEvaluation"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `patient`: An object containing the patient reference

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ImmunizationEvaluation"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field, setting its value to the provided `REF`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) which should be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It's assumed that the calling code will provide valid values for `ID` and `REF`.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template creates a partial ImmunizationEvaluation resource. In a complete FHIR resource, there would likely be additional fields and nested objects.
3. The JSON structure in the template is not complete (it has trailing commas and is wrapped in extra curly braces). This suggests it might be a part of a larger template or structure.
