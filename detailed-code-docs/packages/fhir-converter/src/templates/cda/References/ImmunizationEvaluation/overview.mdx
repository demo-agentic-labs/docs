## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) ImmunizationEvaluation resources. These templates focus on specific aspects of the ImmunizationEvaluation resource, namely the authority, immunizationEvent, and patient references.

## What does it do?
These templates are used to generate structured JSON objects that represent parts of an ImmunizationEvaluation resource in the FHIR standard. Each template focuses on a specific reference within the ImmunizationEvaluation:

1. The authority template sets up the reference to the organization or individual responsible for the immunization evaluation.
2. The immunizationEvent template creates a reference to the associated immunization event.
3. The patient template establishes a reference to the patient who received the immunization evaluation.

These templates are likely used as building blocks to construct complete ImmunizationEvaluation resources when processing Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents and converting them to FHIR format.

## Key Files
1. `authority.hbs`: This template creates the structure for the authority reference in an ImmunizationEvaluation resource.
2. `immunizationEvent.hbs`: This template sets up the immunizationEvent reference, linking the evaluation to a specific immunization event.
3. `patient.hbs`: This template establishes the patient reference for the ImmunizationEvaluation resource.

Each of these files follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resourceType": "ImmunizationEvaluation",
  "id": "{{ID}}",
  "{{referenceType}}": {
    "reference": "{{REF}}"
  },
}
```

Where `{{referenceType}}` is replaced with "authority", "immunizationEvent", or "patient" depending on the specific template.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content. They are designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, likely the FHIR Converter project mentioned in the copyright notices.

## Configuration
The templates use Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:

| Placeholder | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| {{ID}}      | The unique identifier for the ImmunizationEvaluation resource |
| {{REF}}     | The reference value for the specific relationship (authority, immunizationEvent, or patient) |

These placeholders are expected to be replaced with actual values when the templates are rendered as part of the FHIR conversion process.

## Notes
1. These templates create partial representations of an ImmunizationEvaluation resource, focusing on specific references. They are likely intended to be combined with other data or templates to form complete FHIR resources.
2. The JSON structures in the templates are not complete (they have trailing commas and are wrapped in extra curly braces), suggesting they are fragments meant to be integrated into larger JSON objects.
3. The templates are part of a larger project involving multiple contributors, including Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation, as indicated by the copyright notices.
4. The use of these templates suggests a modular approach to FHIR resource generation, allowing for flexibility and reusability in the conversion process from CDA to FHIR format.
