### ImmunizationEvaluation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an ImmunizationEvaluation FHIR resource. It sets the `resourceType`, `id`, and `immunizationEvent` properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the ImmunizationEvaluation resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the associated immunization event |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A structured JSON object representing an ImmunizationEvaluation FHIR resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ImmunizationEvaluation"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `immunizationEvent` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with multiple contributors (Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation).
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of an ImmunizationEvaluation resource, focusing only on the `immunizationEvent` reference. It may be used as part of a larger template or combined with other data to create a complete FHIR resource.
3. The JSON structure includes extra commas at the end of some objects, which might need to be handled or removed when processing the final output to ensure valid JSON.
