### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object for an Encounter resource in FHIR format. It specifically defines the diagnosis section of the Encounter, which includes a reference to a condition.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the condition associated with the diagnosis |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an Encounter resource with a diagnosis section.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets the "resourceType" to "Encounter".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. In the "diagnosis" array, it creates a single object with a "condition" property.
5. The "condition" property contains a "reference" field, which is set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of the Encounter ID and the reference to the associated condition.
3. The structure follows the FHIR standard for Encounter resources, specifically focusing on the diagnosis section.
4. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR-compliant data, possibly from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format, as suggested by the file path.
