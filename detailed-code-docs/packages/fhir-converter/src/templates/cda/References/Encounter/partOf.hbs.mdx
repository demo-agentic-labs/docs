### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a partial FHIR Encounter resource, emphasizing the `partOf` field. It's used to represent an Encounter that is part of another Encounter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the parent Encounter |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A partial FHIR Encounter resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Encounter".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `partOf` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided and valid.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template generates a partial FHIR resource, focusing only on the `partOf` relationship. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to create a complete Encounter resource.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and might be intended to be merged with other data to form a full FHIR Encounter resource.
4. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for Handlebars expressions, indicating where dynamic content should be inserted.
