## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for creating a FHIR Encounter resource with an associated appointment reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for handling CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversions.

### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Encounter resource. It includes an appointment reference, which is a key component of the Encounter resource in FHIR.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated appointment |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Encounter resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Encounter",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "appointment": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Encounter".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the unique identifier for the Encounter.
3. The `appointment` field is an array with a single object containing a `reference` to the appointment, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and requirements for the Encounter resource |

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`), which would be populated by the converter system using this template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in a path suggesting it's used for CDA to FHIR conversions, focusing on Encounter resources and appointments.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and would likely be part of a larger FHIR resource bundle or used in conjunction with other templates to create a full FHIR document.
