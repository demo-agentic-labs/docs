## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Encounter resource structure, specifically focusing on the participant's individual reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

## Symbols

### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Encounter resource with a focus on the participant's individual reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the individual participant |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Encounter resource with the participant's individual reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an Encounter resource structure.
2. Sets the resourceType to "Encounter".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the resource.
4. Creates a participant array with a single object.
5. Within the participant object, sets the individual's reference using the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on other templates and helper functions within the project ecosystem.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the input variables (ID and REF) to populate the resource structure.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The structure is designed to be a partial representation of an Encounter resource, focusing only on the participant's individual reference. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates to create a complete FHIR Encounter resource.
4. The template follows the FHIR resource structure for Encounters, specifically the participant element with an individual reference.

This template plays a crucial role in the CDA to FHIR conversion process, handling the transformation of participant information in encounter data.
