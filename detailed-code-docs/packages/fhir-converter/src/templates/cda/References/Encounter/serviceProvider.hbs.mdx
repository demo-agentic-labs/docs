### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Encounter resource with a focus on the `serviceProvider` field. It's structured to be included as part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the service provider |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Encounter resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the resource type as "Encounter"
2. Sets the resource ID using the provided `{{ID}}` placeholder
3. Specifies the `serviceProvider` field with a reference using the `{{REF}}` placeholder

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined within this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` placeholders will be properly populated when the template is rendered.
