## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating an Encounter resource in FHIR format, specifically focusing on the episodeOfCare field. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Encounter resource with an episodeOfCare reference. It's structured to be part of a larger FHIR document or bundle.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated EpisodeOfCare resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Encounter resource with the episodeOfCare field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a resource object with type "Encounter"
2. Sets the id of the Encounter to the provided `{{ID}}`
3. Adds an episodeOfCare array with a single element
4. The episodeOfCare element contains a reference to another resource, specified by `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and rules for the Encounter resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders are expected to be replaced with actual values when the template is processed.

## Notes
1. The file includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the episodeOfCare field of an Encounter resource, suggesting it's part of a modular template system where different aspects of FHIR resources are handled separately.
3. The structure allows for only one episodeOfCare reference, though the FHIR specification allows for multiple. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified.
4. The template doesn't include other fields that might be required or commonly used in an Encounter resource, indicating it's likely used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete Encounter resource.
