### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object for an Encounter resource in FHIR format. It specifically includes the location information for the encounter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location associated with the encounter |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing an Encounter resource with location information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Encounter".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "location" array with a single object.
5. Within the location object, sets a "location" property with a "reference" field containing the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering the JSON structure with dynamic values.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided correctly.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3.
2. The structure follows the FHIR specification for Encounter resources, focusing specifically on the location information.
3. The template uses double curly braces ({{ }}) for Handlebars variable interpolation.
4. The JSON structure is formatted for readability, with nested objects and arrays properly indented.

This template serves as a reusable component for generating the location part of an Encounter resource in FHIR format, which can be integrated into larger FHIR document generation processes.
