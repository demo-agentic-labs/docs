## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating various aspects of FHIR Encounter resources. These templates are part of a FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or reference within the Encounter resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR Encounter resource. An Encounter in FHIR represents an interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s). The templates in this directory handle various aspects of an Encounter, such as:

1. Linking the encounter to an account
2. Associating the encounter with an appointment
3. Specifying what the encounter is based on
4. Adding diagnosis information
5. Connecting the encounter to an episode of care
6. Detailing hospitalization origin and destination
7. Specifying the location of the encounter
8. Indicating if the encounter is part of another encounter
9. Adding participant information
10. Providing reasons for the encounter
11. Specifying the service provider
12. Identifying the subject (usually the patient) of the encounter

Each template generates a JSON structure for a specific part of the Encounter resource, which can then be combined to form a complete FHIR Encounter resource.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual Handlebars templates. Each template is designed to handle a specific aspect of the Encounter resource. Some key templates include:

1. `subject.hbs`: Defines the subject (usually the patient) of the encounter
2. `serviceProvider.hbs`: Specifies the organization providing the encounter
3. `reasonReference.hbs`: Provides reasons for the encounter
4. `participant.individual.hbs`: Adds information about individual participants in the encounter
5. `location.location.hbs`: Specifies the location of the encounter
6. `hospitalization.origin.hbs` and `hospitalization.destination.hbs`: Detail hospitalization information
7. `episodeOfCare.hbs`: Connects the encounter to an episode of care
8. `diagnosis.condition.hbs`: Adds diagnosis information to the encounter

The data flow typically starts from a CDA document, which is processed by the FHIR converter system. This system would use these templates to transform relevant CDA data into the appropriate FHIR Encounter resource structure.

## Key Files
All files in this directory are important as they each handle a specific aspect of the Encounter resource. However, some files that might be considered more central to the Encounter resource include:

1. `subject.hbs`: Essential for identifying the patient involved in the encounter
2. `serviceProvider.hbs`: Important for specifying the healthcare provider organization
3. `diagnosis.condition.hbs`: Crucial for including diagnostic information
4. `location.location.hbs`: Key for specifying where the encounter took place

## Dependencies
These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system and depend on:

1. Handlebars (version unspecified): Used as the templating engine for generating the JSON structures
2. FHIR Specification (version unspecified): Defines the structure and requirements for the Encounter resource

## Configuration
These templates don't include explicit configuration options. They use Handlebars placeholders (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`) which are expected to be populated with actual values when the templates are processed by the FHIR converter system.

The templates are designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for easy integration into larger FHIR resource constructions. The use of separate templates for different aspects of the Encounter resource allows for modular composition of the final FHIR resource.
