### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Encounter resource, specifically focusing on the hospitalization origin details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the origin of the hospitalization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A structured JSON object representing a FHIR Encounter resource with hospitalization origin details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a resource object with type "Encounter"
2. Sets the resource ID using the provided `{{ID}}` input
3. Defines a hospitalization object within the resource
4. Within the hospitalization object, sets an origin object with a reference property
5. The reference property is set to the provided `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`).

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required variables (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
- The template focuses solely on the hospitalization origin aspect of an Encounter resource. Other properties of the Encounter resource are not included in this template.
- The structure follows the FHIR specification for Encounter resources, particularly the hospitalization and origin elements.
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project with multiple contributors, including Microsoft and Metriport Inc.
