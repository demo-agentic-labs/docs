### Encounter Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Encounter resource, specifically focusing on the hospitalization destination information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Encounter resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the destination of hospitalization |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Encounter resource with hospitalization destination information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Encounter".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `hospitalization` object with a nested `destination` object.
5. Sets the `reference` field of the `destination` object to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the Encounter resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the reference to the hospitalization destination |

## Notes
- This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The template focuses solely on the hospitalization destination aspect of an Encounter resource, suggesting it's meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete Encounter resource.
