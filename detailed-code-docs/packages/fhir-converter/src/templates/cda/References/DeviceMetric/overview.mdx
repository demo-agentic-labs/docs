## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR DeviceMetric resources. The templates focus on creating partial representations of DeviceMetric resources, specifically handling the 'parent' and 'source' attributes. These templates are designed to be used as part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory provide a structured way to create JSON representations of FHIR DeviceMetric resources. They allow for the generation of DeviceMetric resources with specific attributes:

1. The 'parent.hbs' template creates a DeviceMetric resource with a parent reference, which could be used to indicate the relationship between a metric and its parent device.

2. The 'source.hbs' template creates a DeviceMetric resource with a source reference, which could be used to specify the origin of the metric data.

These templates serve as building blocks in a larger FHIR conversion process, allowing for the creation of standardized FHIR resources from CDA data. They provide a consistent structure for representing device metrics, which is crucial in healthcare data interoperability.

## Key Files

1. parent.hbs
   - Purpose: Generates a DeviceMetric resource with a parent reference.
   - Key features:
     - Sets the resource type to "DeviceMetric"
     - Includes an ID field
     - Creates a parent object with a reference field

2. source.hbs
   - Purpose: Generates a DeviceMetric resource with a source reference.
   - Key features:
     - Sets the resource type to "DeviceMetric"
     - Includes an ID field
     - Creates a source object with a reference field

Both templates use Handlebars syntax to allow for dynamic content insertion, expecting 'ID' and 'REF' values to be provided when rendered.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated with other templates and processing logic.

## Configuration
The templates themselves don't include specific configuration options. They use a fixed structure for the DeviceMetric resource, with placeholders for dynamic content. The configuration and use of these templates would be determined by the larger system they're integrated into.

## Notes

1. License and Copyright: Both templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.

2. Partial Representations: These templates create partial representations of DeviceMetric resources, focusing on specific attributes (parent or source). They are likely intended to be used in combination with other templates or processing logic to create complete FHIR resources.

3. JSON Structure: The templates generate JSON structures. It's worth noting that the 'source.hbs' template includes extra commas at the end of some objects, which might need to be handled in the final processing to ensure valid JSON output.

4. Error Handling: Neither template implements explicit error handling. They assume that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when rendered. In a production environment, it would be advisable to implement error checking and handling in the system that uses these templates.

5. Flexibility: The simplicity of these templates allows for flexibility in their use. They can be easily integrated into various FHIR conversion workflows, allowing for customization based on specific needs.

6. FHIR Compliance: While these templates provide a structure for DeviceMetric resources, ensuring full FHIR compliance would depend on how they are used and combined with other data in the larger conversion process.

In summary, these templates provide a standardized way to generate parts of FHIR DeviceMetric resources, focusing on parent and source references. They are designed to be building blocks in a larger FHIR conversion system, allowing for consistent and structured representation of device metric data in healthcare information exchange.
