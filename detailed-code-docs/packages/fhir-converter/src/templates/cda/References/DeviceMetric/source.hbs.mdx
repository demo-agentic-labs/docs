## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a FHIR DeviceMetric resource, specifically focusing on the 'source' attribute. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a DeviceMetric resource with a source reference.

### DeviceMetric Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DeviceMetric resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a source reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DeviceMetric resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the source of the DeviceMetric |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceMetric resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceMetric"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `source` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the DeviceMetric resource.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. If the required inputs (ID and REF) are not provided, the resulting JSON will contain empty values for those fields.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a DeviceMetric resource, focusing only on the 'source' attribute. It may be intended to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other partial templates to create a complete DeviceMetric resource.
3. The JSON structure includes extra commas at the end of some objects, which might need to be handled or removed when processing the final output to ensure valid JSON.
