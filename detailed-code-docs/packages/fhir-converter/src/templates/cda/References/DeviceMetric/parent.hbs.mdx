## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR DeviceMetric resource with a parent reference. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a DeviceMetric with minimal information, specifically focusing on the parent relationship.

### DeviceMetric Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DeviceMetric resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a parent reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DeviceMetric resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the parent device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceMetric resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceMetric"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `parent` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders (\{\{ID\}\} and \{\{REF\}\}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON is minimal, focusing only on the essential fields for a DeviceMetric resource with a parent reference.
3. The template uses double curly braces (\{\{ \}\}) for Handlebars variable interpolation.
4. The resulting JSON structure is not a complete FHIR resource and would likely be part of a larger FHIR document or bundle.
