## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR DeviceRequest resource structure, specifically focusing on the `supportingInfo` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### DeviceRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR DeviceRequest resource, specifically populating the `supportingInfo` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DeviceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR DeviceRequest resource with `supportingInfo` field |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceRequest".
3. It sets the `id` of the DeviceRequest using the `{{ID}}` input.
4. In the `supportingInfo` array, it adds an object with a `reference` property set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of Metriport Inc.'s codebase.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a DeviceRequest resource, focusing only on the `supportingInfo` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete DeviceRequest resource.
3. The structure allows for only one supporting info reference. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified or used multiple times.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and would likely be merged with other data to form a full FHIR resource.
