### DeviceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DeviceRequest resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a codeReference field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the DeviceRequest resource |
| REF  | String | The reference value for the codeReference field |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceRequest resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceRequest"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `codeReference` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to FHIR format.
3. The generated JSON structure is nested within a "resource" object, suggesting it might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or response structure.
