## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR DeviceRequest resource with an associated encounter reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### DeviceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR DeviceRequest resource with an embedded encounter reference. The template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the encounter reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the DeviceRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceRequest resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the DeviceRequest details
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "DeviceRequest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `encounter`: An object containing the reference to the associated encounter

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to insert the provided values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR converters for transforming data between different healthcare data formats.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the Handlebars placeholders at runtime.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. Error management would typically be handled by the system using this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it defines the structure of a FHIR DeviceRequest resource. The resulting JSON object adheres to the FHIR specification for DeviceRequest resources, specifically including an encounter reference.
