### DeviceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR DeviceRequest resource structure with a performer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DeviceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer of the device request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR DeviceRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" as "DeviceRequest"
   - "id" using the provided `{{ID}}` value
   - "performer" object with a "reference" field set to the provided `{{REF}}` value

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the input variables `ID` and `REF` to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the "performer" field of a DeviceRequest resource, suggesting it might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete DeviceRequest resource.
3. The JSON structure is partial and nested, implying it might be intended to be included in a larger FHIR bundle or resource collection.
