### DeviceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR DeviceRequest resource with a specific structure, focusing on the reasonReference field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DeviceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceRequest resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "DeviceRequest"
- id: The provided ID
- reasonReference: An array containing a single object with a reference field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the resourceType to "DeviceRequest".
2. It assigns the provided ID to the id field.
3. It creates a reasonReference array with a single object.
4. The object in the reasonReference array has a reference field set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ID | String | None | The identifier for the DeviceRequest resource |
| REF | String | None | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the output suggests it's meant to be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or a collection of resources.
3. The reasonReference field is structured as an array, allowing for potential expansion to multiple references, although this template only includes one.
