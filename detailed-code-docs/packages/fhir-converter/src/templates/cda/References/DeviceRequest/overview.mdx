## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR DeviceRequest resources. These templates are part of a FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or property of a DeviceRequest resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR DeviceRequest resource. A DeviceRequest is used in healthcare to record requests for the use of a medical device by a patient. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various components of a DeviceRequest, such as:

1. Specifying the base resource that this DeviceRequest is based on
2. Referencing the code for the requested device
3. Linking to an associated encounter
4. Including insurance information
5. Identifying the performer of the device request
6. Referencing prior requests
7. Specifying the reason for the request
8. Including relevant history
9. Identifying the requester
10. Specifying the subject (patient or group) of the request
11. Adding supporting information

Each template generates a JSON structure for a specific part of the DeviceRequest resource, which can then be combined to form a complete resource.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Creates a DeviceRequest with a `basedOn` property, indicating that this request is based on another resource.
2. `codeReference.hbs`: Generates a DeviceRequest with a `codeReference` field, which specifies the device being requested.
3. `encounter.hbs`: Produces a DeviceRequest with an `encounter` reference, linking the request to a specific healthcare encounter.
4. `insurance.hbs`: Creates a DeviceRequest with an `insurance` field, referencing the insurance coverage for the request.
5. `performer.hbs`: Generates a DeviceRequest with a `performer` field, identifying who should fulfill the request.
6. `priorRequest.hbs`: Produces a DeviceRequest with a `priorRequest` field, referencing any previous related requests.
7. `reasonReference.hbs`: Creates a DeviceRequest with a `reasonReference` field, specifying the reason for the request.
8. `relevantHistory.hbs`: Generates a DeviceRequest with a `relevantHistory` field, including pertinent historical information.
9. `requester.hbs`: Produces a DeviceRequest with a `requester` field, identifying who is making the request.
10. `subject.hbs`: Creates a DeviceRequest with a `subject` field, specifying the patient or group for whom the device is requested.
11. `supportingInfo.hbs`: Generates a DeviceRequest with a `supportingInfo` field, including additional relevant information.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a partial JSON object for a DeviceRequest resource with a focus on a specific field. They all use Handlebars syntax to allow for dynamic content insertion.

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR converters for transforming data between different healthcare data formats. They are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated with other components for processing and combining the generated partial resources.

## Configuration
The templates don't have explicit configuration options. Instead, they use Handlebars placeholders (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to allow for dynamic content insertion when the templates are rendered. The actual values for these placeholders would be provided by the system using these templates during the conversion process.

In conclusion, this directory contains a set of modular templates that work together to create various components of FHIR DeviceRequest resources. They provide a flexible and maintainable approach to generating complex FHIR resources as part of a larger CDA to FHIR conversion process.
