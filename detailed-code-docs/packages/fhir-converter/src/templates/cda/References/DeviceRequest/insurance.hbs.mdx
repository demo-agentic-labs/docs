## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR DeviceRequest resource with an insurance reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### DeviceRequest Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a FHIR DeviceRequest resource, focusing specifically on the insurance field. It creates a JSON object representing a DeviceRequest with an ID and an insurance reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DeviceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurance resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR DeviceRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "DeviceRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "insurance": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceRequest".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field.
3. It creates an `insurance` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR conversion processes.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders are expected to be replaced with actual values during the conversion process.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly during the conversion process.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but rather a part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` values and outputs a JSON structure that conforms to the FHIR DeviceRequest resource specification, specifically for the insurance field.
