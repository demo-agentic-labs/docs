## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR DeviceRequest resource structure, specifically focusing on the `requester` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### DeviceRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR DeviceRequest resource with a focus on the `requester` field. It sets up the basic structure of a DeviceRequest resource and populates the `requester` field with a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DeviceRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the requester of the device |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR DeviceRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceRequest"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `requester` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and helpers to convert CDA documents to FHIR format.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for dynamic content insertion:
- `{{ID}}`: Placeholder for the DeviceRequest resource identifier
- `{{REF}}`: Placeholder for the requester reference

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template creates a nested structure (`resource` within an outer object), which suggests it might be used as part of a larger FHIR Bundle or within a more complex conversion process.
3. The `requester` field is populated with a reference, implying that the actual requester details are stored in another resource and referenced here.
4. This template appears to be a partial representation of a DeviceRequest resource, focusing only on the `id` and `requester` fields. Other fields that are typically part of a DeviceRequest resource (such as `status`, `intent`, `codeableConcept`, etc.) are not included in this template.
