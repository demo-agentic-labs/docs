### Linkage Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Linkage resource. It includes an `id` and an `author` reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Linkage resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the author of the Linkage |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON structure representing a FHIR Linkage resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Linkage"
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
4. Creates an `author` object with a `reference` property set to the provided `REF`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders (\{\{ID\}\} and \{\{REF\}\}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (\{\{...\}\}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The resulting JSON structure is not complete and appears to be part of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the trailing commas.
4. This template focuses solely on creating the Linkage resource with an author reference. Other properties of the Linkage resource are not included in this template.
