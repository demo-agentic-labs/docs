## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for an AdverseEvent resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It specifically focuses on the `referenceDocument` field of the AdverseEvent resource, providing a way to link to related documents.

### AdverseEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an AdverseEvent resource with a `referenceDocument` field. The AdverseEvent resource is used to record unintended or unexpected events related to the use of a medical product or a medical intervention.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the AdverseEvent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the related document |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an AdverseEvent resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "AdverseEvent",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "referenceDocument": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "AdverseEvent".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's unique identifier.
3. The `referenceDocument` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` property.
4. The `reference` property uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the document reference.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The `referenceDocument` array is hardcoded to contain only one element. If multiple document references are needed, the template would need to be modified.
3. The JSON structure is not closed with a final curly brace, suggesting that this template might be part of a larger structure or that additional properties might be added after this template is rendered.
