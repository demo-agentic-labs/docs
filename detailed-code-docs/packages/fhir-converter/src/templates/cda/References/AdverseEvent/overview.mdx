## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating various components of an AdverseEvent resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. These templates are part of a larger system designed to convert Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format, specifically focusing on adverse events in healthcare.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of an AdverseEvent resource, which is used in healthcare to record unintended or unexpected events related to medical products or interventions. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the AdverseEvent, such as the contributor, encounter, location, recorder, reference document, resulting condition, study, subject, subject's medical history, and suspect entity.

When used in a FHIR conversion process, these templates allow for the structured transformation of CDA data into FHIR-compliant JSON objects. This enables better interoperability and standardization of healthcare data across different systems and organizations.

## Key Files
1. contributor.hbs: Creates the contributor field for an AdverseEvent resource.
2. encounter.hbs: Defines the encounter reference for an AdverseEvent.
3. location.hbs: Specifies the location associated with an AdverseEvent.
4. recorder.hbs: Identifies the individual who recorded the adverse event.
5. referenceDocument.hbs: Links related documents to the AdverseEvent.
6. resultingCondition.hbs: Describes the condition resulting from the adverse event.
7. study.hbs: References a related study associated with the AdverseEvent.
8. subject.hbs: Identifies the person who experienced the adverse event.
9. subjectMedicalHistory.hbs: Links to the subject's medical history.
10. suspectEntity.instance.hbs: Represents a suspected entity involved in the adverse event.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:
```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "AdverseEvent",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "specificField": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

Where `specificField` is replaced by the relevant field name (e.g., contributor, location, subject, etc.), and `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are placeholders for the resource ID and reference, respectively.

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to work with:
1. Handlebars: A templating engine used for generating the JSON structures.
2. FHIR Converter: The broader system these templates are a part of, used for converting CDA to FHIR format.

## Configuration
While these templates don't have explicit configuration options, they rely on two main inputs:
1. ID: A unique identifier for the AdverseEvent resource.
2. REF: A reference to the specific entity related to the field (e.g., contributor, location, subject).

These inputs are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered as part of the conversion process.

## Notes
1. These templates are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for handling AdverseEvent resources.
2. Each template defines a partial AdverseEvent resource, focusing on a specific field. They are likely meant to be combined to form a complete AdverseEvent resource.
3. The templates include a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
4. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that these values are expected to be provided dynamically when the templates are rendered.
5. Error handling and input validation are not present in these templates, suggesting these responsibilities may be handled elsewhere in the conversion process.
6. The templates follow the FHIR resource structure but only include partial representations of an AdverseEvent resource, focusing on specific fields.
