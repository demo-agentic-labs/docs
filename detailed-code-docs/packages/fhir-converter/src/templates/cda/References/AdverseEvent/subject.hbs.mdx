## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for the "subject" field of an AdverseEvent resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### AdverseEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR AdverseEvent resource, focusing on the "subject" field. The subject represents the person who experienced the adverse event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the AdverseEvent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject (typically a Patient resource) |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial AdverseEvent resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "AdverseEvent",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "AdverseEvent".
2. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
3. The `subject` field is populated with a `reference` object, containing the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of, used for converting CDA to FHIR |

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger set of templates used for converting various parts of CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial AdverseEvent resource. Other templates or processes would likely be needed to complete the full resource structure.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where dynamic values should be inserted during the template rendering process.
