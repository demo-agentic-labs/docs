### AdverseEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR AdverseEvent resource, focusing on the suspectEntity field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR document generation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the AdverseEvent resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the suspected entity instance |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR AdverseEvent resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "AdverseEvent"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `suspectEntity`: An array containing a single object with:
    - `instance`: An object with a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for an AdverseEvent resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "AdverseEvent".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. In the `suspectEntity` array, it creates an object with an `instance` field.
5. The `instance` object contains a `reference` field, which is set using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR format.
2. The template only defines a partial AdverseEvent resource, focusing on the suspectEntity. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
