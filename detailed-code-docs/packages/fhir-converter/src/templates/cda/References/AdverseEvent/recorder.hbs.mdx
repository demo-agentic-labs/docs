## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) AdverseEvent resource structure, specifically focusing on the `recorder` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### AdverseEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR AdverseEvent resource with a focus on the `recorder` field. The `recorder` represents the individual who recorded the adverse event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the AdverseEvent resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the individual who recorded the adverse event |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR AdverseEvent resource with the `recorder` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an outer JSON structure with a `resource` object.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "AdverseEvent".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `recorder` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the correct provision of `ID` and `REF` values when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a collection for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources, specifically for AdverseEvent resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template generates a partial resource, likely to be combined with other parts to form a complete AdverseEvent resource.
4. Error handling and input validation are not present in this template, suggesting these responsibilities may be handled elsewhere in the conversion process.
