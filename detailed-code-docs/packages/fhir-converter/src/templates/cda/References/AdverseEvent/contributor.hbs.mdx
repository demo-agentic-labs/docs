## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) AdverseEvent resource structure, specifically focusing on the "contributor" field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### AdverseEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an AdverseEvent FHIR resource, specifically populating the "contributor" field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the AdverseEvent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the contributor of the adverse event |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial AdverseEvent FHIR resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: Always set to "AdverseEvent"
- id: The unique identifier for this resource
- contributor: An array containing a single object with a "reference" field

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resourceType to "AdverseEvent"
2. Assigns the provided ID to the resource's id field
3. Creates a contributor array with a single object
4. Sets the reference of the contributor to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for handling AdverseEvent resources.
2. The template only populates a subset of the AdverseEvent resource fields, focusing on the contributor.
3. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that these values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.
4. The copyright notice suggests that this code is based on work by Microsoft but has been modified and is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
5. The template follows the FHIR resource structure but only includes a partial representation of an AdverseEvent resource.
