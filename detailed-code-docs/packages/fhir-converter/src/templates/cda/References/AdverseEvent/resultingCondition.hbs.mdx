## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for the `resultingCondition` field of an `AdverseEvent` resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### AdverseEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an `AdverseEvent` resource, focusing on the `resultingCondition` field. The `resultingCondition` is an array containing a single reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the AdverseEvent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resulting condition resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial `AdverseEvent` resource with the `resultingCondition` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "AdverseEvent" and assigns the provided `ID`.
3. The `resultingCondition` field is an array with a single object containing a `reference` property.
4. The `reference` property is set to the value of the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, which is implied by the `.hbs` file extension and the use of Handlebars syntax (`{{}}`) for variable interpolation.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the input variables provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the Microsoft portion is provided under a more permissive license.
3. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting healthcare data between different formats (CDA to FHIR in this case).
4. The structure suggests that this template might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
5. The template only defines a partial resource structure, focusing on the `resultingCondition` field. Other fields of the `AdverseEvent` resource are not included in this template.
