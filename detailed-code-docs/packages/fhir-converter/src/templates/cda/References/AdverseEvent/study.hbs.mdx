### AdverseEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object for an AdverseEvent resource, including an ID and a reference to a related study.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the AdverseEvent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the related study |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing an AdverseEvent resource with study reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "AdverseEvent"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "study" array with a single object containing a "reference" field
5. Sets the "reference" value to the provided REF input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the AdverseEvent resource.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as mentioned in the header comments.
3. The structure follows the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for representing an AdverseEvent resource.
4. The template only populates the "id" and "study" fields of the AdverseEvent resource. Other fields that might be part of a complete AdverseEvent resource are not included in this template.
