### AdverseEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR AdverseEvent resource with a location reference. It's structured to be included as part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the AdverseEvent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location associated with the adverse event |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR AdverseEvent resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "AdverseEvent",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "location": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for an AdverseEvent resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "AdverseEvent".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's id.
4. It includes a `location` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is specifically located in the "References/AdverseEvent" directory, suggesting it's part of a larger set of templates for converting various aspects of CDA documents to FHIR resources.
3. This template only defines a partial AdverseEvent resource, focusing solely on the location reference. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete AdverseEvent resource.
