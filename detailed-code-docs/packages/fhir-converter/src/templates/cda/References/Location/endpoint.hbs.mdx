## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Location resource with an endpoint reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Location Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Location resource with an endpoint reference. The Location resource is used to describe a physical place where services are provided and resources and participants may be stored, found, contained, or accommodated.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Location resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the endpoint associated with this location |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Location resource with the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resource | Object | The FHIR Location resource |
| resource.resourceType | String | Always set to "Location" |
| resource.id | String | The unique identifier for the Location resource |
| resource.endpoint | Array | An array containing a single endpoint reference |
| resource.endpoint[0].reference | String | The reference to the associated endpoint |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Location".
2. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
3. It creates an `endpoint` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, which is set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of, used for converting CDA to FHIR |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is specifically located in the path `packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/Location/`, suggesting it's part of a larger template structure for CDA to FHIR conversion.
3. This template focuses solely on the Location resource and its endpoint reference. Other aspects of a Location resource (such as name, address, etc.) are not included, suggesting this template might be used in conjunction with others to build a complete Location resource.
