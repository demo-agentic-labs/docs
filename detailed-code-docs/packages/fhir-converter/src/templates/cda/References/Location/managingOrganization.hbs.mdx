### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure representing a FHIR Location resource with a managing organization reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Location resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the managing organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A FHIR-compliant Location resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a "resource" object with "resourceType" set to "Location"
2. Sets the "id" of the Location resource using the `{{ID}}` input
3. Defines a "managingOrganization" object with a "reference" property set to the `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It specifically handles the creation of a Location resource with a managing organization reference. It would typically be used in conjunction with other templates and a FHIR conversion engine.

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the Location resource |
| REF | string | Reference to the managing organization |

The output is a JSON structure that conforms to the FHIR Location resource specification, focusing on the managing organization reference.
