## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of FHIR Immunization resources. These templates are designed to be used in a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the Immunization resource, such as encounter, location, manufacturer, patient, performer, protocol applied authority, reaction detail, and reason reference.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different components of a FHIR Immunization resource. When used in a conversion process, they help transform CDA data into the standardized FHIR format. Each template generates a partial JSON structure that represents a specific part of the Immunization resource. For example:

1. The encounter template creates a reference to the associated healthcare encounter.
2. The location template specifies where the immunization was administered.
3. The manufacturer template links to the vaccine manufacturer.
4. The patient template references the patient who received the immunization.
5. The performer template identifies who administered the vaccine.
6. The protocolApplied.authority template specifies the authority for the immunization protocol.
7. The reaction.detail template provides information about any reactions to the immunization.
8. The reasonReference template gives the reason for the immunization.

These partial structures are likely combined in a larger process to create a complete FHIR Immunization resource.

## Key Files
1. encounter.hbs: Creates the encounter reference for the Immunization resource.
2. location.hbs: Generates the location reference where the immunization was administered.
3. manufacturer.hbs: Produces the manufacturer reference for the vaccine.
4. patient.hbs: Creates the patient reference for the Immunization resource.
5. performer.actor.hbs: Generates the performer's actor reference for the immunization.
6. protocolApplied.authority.hbs: Creates the authority reference for the immunization protocol.
7. reaction.detail.hbs: Generates the reaction detail reference for any immunization reactions.
8. reasonReference.hbs: Produces the reason reference for the immunization.

Each of these files follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Immunization",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "specificField": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

Where "specificField" is replaced by the relevant field for each template (e.g., "encounter", "location", "manufacturer", etc.).

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine. They are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely including other templates and helper functions not present in this directory.

## Configuration
Each template uses two main configuration inputs:
1. ID: A string representing the unique identifier for the Immunization resource.
2. REF: A string containing the reference value for the specific field being populated (e.g., encounter reference, location reference, etc.).

These values are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered as part of the conversion process.

## Notes
1. All templates in this directory include a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates produce partial Immunization resources, focusing on specific fields. They are designed to be combined with other data to form complete FHIR Immunization resources.
3. The JSON structures in these templates often have trailing commas, suggesting they are meant to be merged with other data or wrapped in a larger structure.
4. While most templates follow a similar structure, some (like performer.actor.hbs and protocolApplied.authority.hbs) have slightly different structures to accommodate the specific requirements of those fields in the FHIR specification.
5. These templates demonstrate a modular approach to FHIR resource generation, allowing for flexibility and easier maintenance of the conversion system.
