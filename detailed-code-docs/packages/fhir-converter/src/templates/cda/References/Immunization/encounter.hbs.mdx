## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Immunization resource structure, specifically focusing on the encounter reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR resource generation process for immunization data.

### Immunization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Immunization resource with an encounter reference. It's structured to be included in a larger FHIR resource compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Immunization resource with the following elements:
- `resource`: The main container for the Immunization resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Immunization"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `encounter`: An object containing a reference to the associated encounter

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values:
   - `{{ID}}` is used to set the `id` of the Immunization resource
   - `{{REF}}` is used to set the `reference` of the encounter

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The template relies on the correct provision of `ID` and `REF` values when it's rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format.
2. The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template produces only a partial Immunization resource. In a complete FHIR document, this would likely be combined with other data to form a complete Immunization resource.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and seems to be designed to be merged with other data or wrapped in a larger structure, as indicated by the trailing commas.
