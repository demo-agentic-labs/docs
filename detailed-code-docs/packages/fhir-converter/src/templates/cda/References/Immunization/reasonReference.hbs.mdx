## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for the `reasonReference` field within an Immunization resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for an Immunization resource with a focus on the `reasonReference` field. It's designed to be part of a larger FHIR document conversion process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the reason of the immunization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Immunization resource with `reasonReference` field |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object structure for an Immunization resource.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Immunization".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `reasonReference` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field is populated with the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for dynamic content insertion:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the Immunization resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the reason reference value |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the `reasonReference` field of an Immunization resource, suggesting it's part of a modular approach to FHIR resource generation.
3. The structure allows for only one reason reference, but the FHIR specification allows for multiple. If multiple reasons are needed, the template might need to be adjusted to handle an array of references.
4. The template generates a partial resource structure, likely to be combined with other parts to form a complete FHIR Immunization resource.
