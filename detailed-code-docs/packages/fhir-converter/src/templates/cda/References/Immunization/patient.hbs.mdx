## Symbols

### Immunization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Immunization resource with a focus on the patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this immunization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Immunization resource with patient reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object representing a FHIR Immunization resource.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Immunization".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the copyright of Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
4. The template only defines a partial Immunization resource, focusing on the patient reference. It's likely used in conjunction with other templates or processes to create a complete FHIR Immunization resource.
5. The use of double curly braces (`{{}}`) indicates where dynamic content will be inserted when the template is rendered.
