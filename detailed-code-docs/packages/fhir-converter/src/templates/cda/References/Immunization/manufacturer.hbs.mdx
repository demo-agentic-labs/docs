## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Immunization resource structure, specifically focusing on the manufacturer information. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure representing part of a FHIR Immunization resource, specifically the manufacturer information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the manufacturer |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Immunization resource structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" as "Immunization"
   - "id" using the provided `{{ID}}` value
   - "manufacturer" object with a "reference" property set to the provided `{{REF}}` value

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It may depend on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template is part of the FHIR Converter project, which appears to be originally developed by Microsoft and now maintained or modified by Metriport Inc.
2. The file includes a detailed copyright notice and license information, indicating it's licensed under AGPLv3.
3. The template is specifically designed for the "manufacturer" field of an Immunization resource, suggesting it's meant to be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete Immunization resource.
4. The structure follows the FHIR specification for Immunization resources, particularly the manufacturer field which is represented as a reference to another resource.
