## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Immunization resource structure, specifically focusing on the location reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Immunization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Immunization resource with a focus on the location reference. It's structured to be included in a larger FHIR bundle or resource set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location where the immunization was administered |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR Immunization resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Immunization",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "location": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Immunization".
2. It uses the provided `ID` as the resource's `id`.
3. It creates a `location` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
- This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
- It only represents a partial Immunization resource, focusing solely on the location reference.
- The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `ID` and `REF` to be dynamically populated during the conversion process.
- The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
