### Immunization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Immunization resource with a focus on the performer's actor information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer's actor |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR Immunization resource with performer information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an Immunization resource structure.
2. Sets the resourceType to "Immunization".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the resource.
4. Creates a performer array with a single object.
5. Within the performer object, creates an actor object with a reference field.
6. Assigns the provided REF value to the actor's reference.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the performer's actor |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template generates only a partial Immunization resource, focusing on the performer information. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates to create a complete FHIR Immunization resource.
4. The output is structured as a nested JSON object, which may indicate it's designed to be part of a larger JSON structure, possibly a Bundle resource or a transaction request.
