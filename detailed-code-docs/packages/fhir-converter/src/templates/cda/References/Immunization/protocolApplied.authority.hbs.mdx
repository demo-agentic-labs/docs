## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Immunization resource structure, specifically focusing on the `protocolApplied.authority` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Immunization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Immunization resource with a focus on the `protocolApplied.authority` field. It sets up the basic structure of an Immunization resource and includes the `protocolApplied` array with an `authority` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the authority |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Immunization resource with the `protocolApplied.authority` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Immunization".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `protocolApplied` array with a single object.
5. Within the `protocolApplied` object, sets up an `authority` object with a `reference` field.
6. Assigns the provided `REF` value to the `reference` field of the `authority` object.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on other templates or helpers not shown in this file.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
- The template uses Handlebars syntax (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
- This template appears to be a partial representation of an Immunization resource, focusing specifically on the `protocolApplied.authority` field. It would likely be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR Immunization resource.
