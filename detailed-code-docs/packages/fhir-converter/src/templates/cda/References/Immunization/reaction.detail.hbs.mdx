### Immunization Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object structure for an Immunization resource in FHIR format. It specifically focuses on the reaction details of the immunization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Immunization resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the detailed reaction information |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an Immunization resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "Immunization"
- id: The provided ID
- reaction: An array containing a single object with:
  - detail: An object with a reference to the detailed reaction information

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the resourceType to "Immunization".
3. It sets the id of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}`.
4. It creates a "reaction" array with a single object.
5. Inside the reaction object, it creates a "detail" object with a "reference" key set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The structure is fixed, and the values for ID and REF are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. If the ID or REF values are not provided when rendering the template, those fields will be empty in the resulting JSON.

## TODOs
The template includes a comprehensive copyright and permission notice at the beginning, which covers both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation. This notice should be reviewed and kept up-to-date as necessary.
