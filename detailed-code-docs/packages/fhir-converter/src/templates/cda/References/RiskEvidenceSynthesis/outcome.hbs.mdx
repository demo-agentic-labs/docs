### RiskEvidenceSynthesis Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource with an 'outcome' field. The template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the outcome |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a 'resource' property.
2. Inside 'resource', it sets the 'resourceType' to "RiskEvidenceSynthesis".
3. It sets the 'id' field using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
4. It creates an 'outcome' object with a 'reference' field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is used.
