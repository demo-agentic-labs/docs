### RiskEvidenceSynthesis Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource, focusing on the exposure element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the exposure resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a partial RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "RiskEvidenceSynthesis"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates an "exposure" object with a "reference" property, using the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The template generates a partial FHIR resource, focusing only on the exposure element of a RiskEvidenceSynthesis. It may be part of a larger system that combines multiple such partial resources to create complete FHIR resources.
4. The generated JSON structure is not a complete valid FHIR resource on its own, as it's wrapped in additional "resource" and outer object layers. This suggests it might be designed to be part of a larger data structure or message format.
