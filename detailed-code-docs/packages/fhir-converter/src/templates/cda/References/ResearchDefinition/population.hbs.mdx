### ResearchDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchDefinition resource. It includes a resource type, an ID, and a population reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchDefinition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the population resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR ResearchDefinition resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ResearchDefinition"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `population` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a FHIR ResearchDefinition resource, focusing specifically on the population reference.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and might be intended to be part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource collection.
