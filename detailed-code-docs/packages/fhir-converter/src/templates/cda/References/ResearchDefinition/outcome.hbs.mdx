### ResearchDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchDefinition resource, focusing on the outcome field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchDefinition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the outcome resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR ResearchDefinition resource with an outcome reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ResearchDefinition".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates an `outcome` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR data conversion process.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF inputs will be provided correctly by the calling context.

## Logging
This template doesn't implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API. It's meant to be used as part of a templating system, likely in conjunction with other templates and a data conversion pipeline.
