### ResearchDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ResearchDefinition resource structure with an exposure reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and exposure reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchDefinition resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the exposure |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ResearchDefinition resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the ResearchDefinition details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ResearchDefinition"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `exposure`: An object containing the reference to the exposure

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a ResearchDefinition resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ResearchDefinition".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to insert the provided ID.
4. It creates an `exposure` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder to insert the provided reference value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for `ID` and `REF`.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used in conjunction with other templates to generate complete FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The generated JSON structure is not complete and would likely be combined with other data to form a full ResearchDefinition resource.
4. The template uses minimal formatting and doesn't include any conditional logic, suggesting it's designed for a specific, consistent use case within the larger system.
