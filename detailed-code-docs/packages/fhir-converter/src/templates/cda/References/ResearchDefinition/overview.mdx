## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR ResearchDefinition resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the ResearchDefinition resource, such as exposure, outcome, population, and subject reference.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR ResearchDefinition resource. They allow for dynamic insertion of values like resource IDs and references, which can be populated during the conversion process. The templates cover various aspects of a research definition, including:

1. Exposure: Defines the primary factor being studied.
2. Exposure Alternative: Specifies an alternative exposure for comparison.
3. Outcome: Describes the result or endpoint being measured.
4. Population: Identifies the group of subjects involved in the research.
5. Subject Reference: Specifies the subject of the research definition.

By using these templates, developers can generate consistent and structured FHIR-compliant JSON objects for ResearchDefinition resources, which can then be combined with other data to form complete FHIR resources or bundles.

## Key Files
1. `exposure.hbs`: Generates a ResearchDefinition structure with an exposure reference.
2. `exposureAlternative.hbs`: Creates a ResearchDefinition structure with an alternative exposure reference.
3. `outcome.hbs`: Produces a ResearchDefinition structure focusing on the outcome field.
4. `population.hbs`: Generates a ResearchDefinition structure with a population reference.
5. `subjectReference.hbs`: Creates a ResearchDefinition structure with a subject reference.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, creating a nested JSON object with the "ResearchDefinition" resource type and specific fields relevant to their focus area.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. No specific versions are mentioned in the provided summaries.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in these templates. The behavior of each template is determined by the input values provided for the placeholders, typically `ID` and `REF`.

Example usage of a template (e.g., `exposure.hbs`):

```handlebars
{{&gt;References/ResearchDefinition/exposure ID="123" REF="ResearchSubject/456"}}
```

This would generate a JSON structure like:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "ResearchDefinition",
    "id": "123",
    "exposure": {
      "reference": "ResearchSubject/456"
    }
  }
}
```

It's important to note that these templates generate partial ResearchDefinition resources. In a complete FHIR implementation, additional properties might be required or optional, and these partial resources would likely be combined with other data to form complete FHIR resources or bundles.

The templates are designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for consistent generation of FHIR-compliant JSON structures across different parts of the ResearchDefinition resource. This modular approach facilitates maintenance and updates to the FHIR conversion process, as each aspect of the ResearchDefinition can be modified independently if needed.
