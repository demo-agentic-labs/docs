### ResearchDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a ResearchDefinition resource with an exposureAlternative reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the ResearchDefinition resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the exposureAlternative |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A structured JSON object representing a partial ResearchDefinition resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "ResearchDefinition".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates an "exposureAlternative" object with a "reference" property, setting its value to the provided REF.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure with dynamic values.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template generates only a partial ResearchDefinition resource. In a complete FHIR resource, additional properties might be required or optional.
3. The generated JSON structure is not a complete, valid JSON document on its own. It appears to be designed to be part of a larger JSON structure, possibly an array of resources.
