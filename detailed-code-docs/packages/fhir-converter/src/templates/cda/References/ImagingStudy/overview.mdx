## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various components of FHIR ImagingStudy resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect or field of the ImagingStudy resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of different parts of an ImagingStudy resource in FHIR format. They handle various aspects of an imaging study, such as:

1. The study's base information (basedOn)
2. Associated encounter
3. Endpoints for accessing the study
4. Interpreters of the study
5. Location where the study was performed
6. Procedure references
7. Reasons for the study
8. Referrer information
9. Series details, including endpoints and specimens
10. Subject of the study

Each template takes specific inputs (typically an ID and a reference) and outputs a partial JSON structure that conforms to the FHIR specification for ImagingStudy resources. These partial structures can be combined to form complete ImagingStudy resources as part of the CDA to FHIR conversion process.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Generates the `basedOn` field, indicating what the study is based on.
2. `encounter.hbs`: Creates the `encounter` field, linking the study to a specific healthcare encounter.
3. `endpoint.hbs`: Produces the `endpoint` field, specifying where the study data can be accessed.
4. `interpreter.hbs`: Handles the `interpreter` field, referencing who interpreted the study.
5. `location.hbs`: Generates the `location` field, indicating where the study was performed.
6. `procedureReference.hbs`: Creates the `procedureReference` field, linking to related procedures.
7. `reasonReference.hbs`: Produces the `reasonReference` field, explaining why the study was conducted.
8. `referrer.hbs`: Handles the `referrer` field, indicating who referred the patient for the study.
9. `series.endpoint.hbs` and `series.specimen.hbs`: Generate parts of the `series` field, including endpoints and specimen information.
10. `subject.hbs`: Creates the `subject` field, referencing the patient or subject of the study.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely with additional dependencies for processing and combining the template outputs.

## Configuration
The templates themselves don't include specific configuration options. They use Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation, typically expecting `ID` and `REF` values to be provided when rendered. The actual configuration would be handled by the broader FHIR converter system that uses these templates.

## Notes
1. These templates generate partial FHIR ImagingStudy resources, focusing on specific fields. They are designed to be combined to create complete resources.
2. The templates follow the FHIR specification for ImagingStudy resources, ensuring compatibility with FHIR-compliant systems.
3. Each template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
4. The modular nature of these templates allows for flexibility in resource creation and easier maintenance of the conversion logic.
5. Some templates, like `series.endpoint.hbs` and `series.specimen.hbs`, handle nested structures within the ImagingStudy resource, demonstrating the complexity of FHIR resources.
