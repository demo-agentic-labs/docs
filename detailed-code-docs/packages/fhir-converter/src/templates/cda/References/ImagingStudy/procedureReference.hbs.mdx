### ImagingStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object for an ImagingStudy resource with a procedureReference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and the procedure reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ImagingStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the related procedure |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing an ImagingStudy resource with a procedureReference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "ImagingStudy"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "procedureReference" object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values.

- The template is designed to be a part of a larger FHIR resource generation system, likely used in conjunction with other templates and data processing logic.
- The structure follows the FHIR specification for ImagingStudy resources, focusing specifically on the procedureReference field.
- The template is minimal and focused, suggesting it might be used in combination with other templates to build a complete ImagingStudy resource.
