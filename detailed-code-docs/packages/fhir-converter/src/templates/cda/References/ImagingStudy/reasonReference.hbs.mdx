## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) ImagingStudy resource with a focus on the `reasonReference` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format, specifically for imaging study reasons.

### ImagingStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource structure, emphasizing the `reasonReference` field. It's designed to be integrated into a larger FHIR document or used as part of a conversion process from CDA to FHIR.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the ImagingStudy resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the reason for the imaging study |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource with the `reasonReference` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for an ImagingStudy resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ImagingStudy".
3. It uses the provided `ID` to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `reasonReference` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field is populated with the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of input variables (`ID` and `REF`).

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure suggests this template is meant to be part of a larger conversion process, likely used in conjunction with other templates or scripts to generate complete FHIR resources.
3. The `reasonReference` field is an array, but this template only populates it with a single reference. If multiple reasons are needed, the template would need to be modified or used multiple times.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be merged with other data to form a complete ImagingStudy resource.
