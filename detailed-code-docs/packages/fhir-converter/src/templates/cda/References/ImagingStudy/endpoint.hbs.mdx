title: "endpoint.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for an ImagingStudy resource in FHIR format, specifically focusing on the endpoint attribute. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### ImagingStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an ImagingStudy resource with an endpoint reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the ImagingStudy resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the endpoint associated with the imaging study |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing an ImagingStudy resource with an endpoint reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" as "ImagingStudy"
   - "id" using the provided `{{ID}}` value
   - An "endpoint" array with a single object containing a "reference" key set to the provided `{{REF}}` value

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of Metriport Inc.'s codebase.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions and disclaimers from the original Microsoft copyright.
3. The template is specifically for the "endpoint" attribute of an ImagingStudy resource, suggesting there might be other templates for other attributes or resources.
4. The JSON structure includes some trailing commas, which might need to be handled or removed depending on the JSON parser used with the output.

This template is a small but crucial part of a larger system for converting healthcare data between different standards (CDA to FHIR in this case), focusing specifically on imaging study information.
