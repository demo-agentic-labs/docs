## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR ImagingStudy resource with a specific focus on the series and specimen information. It defines the structure for a single imaging study series with an associated specimen reference.

### ImagingStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of an ImagingStudy resource in FHIR format. It specifically focuses on the series and specimen information within the imaging study.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ImagingStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the specimen associated with the imaging series |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource, focusing on the series and specimen information.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates an object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "ImagingStudy".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. The "series" field is an array containing a single object.
5. Within the series object, there's a "specimen" array with one object.
6. The specimen object contains a "reference" field, which is set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the ImagingStudy resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the specimen reference |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format.
2. The file includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial ImagingStudy resource, focusing specifically on the series and specimen information. It would likely be combined with other templates to create a complete FHIR resource.
4. The structure allows for only one series and one specimen reference, which might be a limitation depending on the use case.
