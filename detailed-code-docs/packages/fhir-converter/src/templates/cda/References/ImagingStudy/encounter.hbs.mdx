## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource with an encounter reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR document conversion process, specifically for handling imaging study data related to a particular encounter.

### ImagingStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource with an encounter reference. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reference to an associated encounter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ImagingStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ImagingStudy"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `encounter` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) which are expected to be populated with appropriate values when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc., licensed under AGPLv3.
3. The template produces a partial resource, likely to be combined with other data to form a complete FHIR ImagingStudy resource.
4. The encounter reference is crucial for linking the imaging study to a specific healthcare encounter in the FHIR data model.
