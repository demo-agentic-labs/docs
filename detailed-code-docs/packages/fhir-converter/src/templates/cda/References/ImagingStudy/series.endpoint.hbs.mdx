## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR ImagingStudy resource with a series endpoint. It specifically focuses on creating the structure for the series and its endpoint within an ImagingStudy resource.

### ImagingStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of an ImagingStudy resource with a focus on the series and endpoint elements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the ImagingStudy resource |
| REF | string | The reference for the endpoint within the series |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource with the following structure:
- A resource object with type "ImagingStudy"
- An id field
- A series array containing:
  - An endpoint array with a single object containing a reference

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` placeholder is used for the ImagingStudy's id, and the `{{REF}}` placeholder is used for the endpoint's reference.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template generates a partial ImagingStudy resource, focusing only on the id and series.endpoint elements. It may be part of a larger system for generating complete FHIR resources.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for ImagingStudy resources, specifically the series and endpoint elements.
4. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of dynamic values (ID and REF) into the static JSON structure.
