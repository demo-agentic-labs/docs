## High-level description

It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR document generation process, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### ImagingStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource with a referrer field. The resource is structured as a JSON object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ImagingStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the referrer of the imaging study |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR ImagingStudy resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ImagingStudy",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "referrer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ImagingStudy".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's `id` field.
3. It creates a `referrer` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used to render this template |
| FHIR specification | Defines the structure and content of the ImagingStudy resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a FHIR converter system, specifically for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template generates only a partial ImagingStudy resource. In a complete FHIR document, additional fields might be required or included.
4. The referrer field in an ImagingStudy resource typically represents the practitioner or organization who referred the patient for the imaging study.
