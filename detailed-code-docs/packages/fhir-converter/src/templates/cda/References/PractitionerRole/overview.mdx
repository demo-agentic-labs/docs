## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR PractitionerRole resources with various references. These templates are part of a FHIR converter, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific reference type within the PractitionerRole resource, such as endpoint, healthcare service, location, organization, and practitioner.

## What does it do?
These templates create JSON structures representing different aspects of a FHIR PractitionerRole resource. They allow for the generation of PractitionerRole resources with specific references, which is crucial in healthcare data interoperability. For example:

1. The endpoint template creates a PractitionerRole with a reference to an endpoint, which could represent a communication point for the practitioner's role.
2. The healthcare service template links a PractitionerRole to a specific healthcare service.
3. The location template associates a PractitionerRole with a particular location.
4. The organization template connects a PractitionerRole to an organization.
5. The practitioner template links a PractitionerRole to a specific practitioner.

These templates enable the conversion process to create detailed and interconnected FHIR resources, reflecting the complex relationships in healthcare data.

## Key Files
1. `endpoint.hbs`: Creates a PractitionerRole resource with an endpoint reference.
2. `healthcareService.hbs`: Generates a PractitionerRole resource with a healthcare service reference.
3. `location.hbs`: Produces a PractitionerRole resource with a location reference.
4. `organization.hbs`: Creates a PractitionerRole resource with an organization reference.
5. `practitioner.hbs`: Generates a PractitionerRole resource with a practitioner reference.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, creating a JSON object for a PractitionerRole resource with a specific type of reference. They all use two input variables: `ID` for the resource identifier and `REF` for the reference to the associated entity.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering. No external libraries or frameworks are explicitly mentioned in the provided summaries.

## Configuration
These templates do not have specific configuration options. They use simple Handlebars syntax for variable substitution ({{ID}} and {{REF}}). The templates assume that the required input variables will be provided when rendered.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how the `practitioner.hbs` template might be used:

```handlebars
{{&gt; PractitionerRole/practitioner ID="role123" REF="Practitioner/doc456"}}
```

This would generate a JSON structure like:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "PractitionerRole",
        "id": "role123",
        "practitioner": {
            "reference": "Practitioner/doc456"
        }
    }
}
```

Similar patterns apply to the other templates in this directory, each focusing on a different type of reference within the PractitionerRole resource.

It's important to note that these templates generate partial FHIR resources, likely to be used as part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource collection in the conversion process.
