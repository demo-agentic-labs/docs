### PractitionerRole Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR PractitionerRole resource. It includes a reference to a Practitioner resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the PractitionerRole resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the associated Practitioner resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR PractitionerRole resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "PractitionerRole",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "practitioner": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "PractitionerRole"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `practitioner` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.
- The generated JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a part of a larger FHIR resource bundle, as indicated by the outer `resource` object.
- The template only defines the basic structure of a PractitionerRole resource and does not include additional fields that might be present in a full PractitionerRole resource according to the FHIR specification.
