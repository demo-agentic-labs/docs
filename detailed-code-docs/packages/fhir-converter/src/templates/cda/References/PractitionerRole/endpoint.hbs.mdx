### PractitionerRole Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR PractitionerRole resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an endpoint reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the PractitionerRole resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the endpoint associated with this PractitionerRole |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR PractitionerRole resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "PractitionerRole"
- id: The provided ID
- endpoint: An array containing a single object with a reference to the provided endpoint

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resourceType to "PractitionerRole"
2. Assigns the provided ID to the resource
3. Creates an endpoint array with a single object containing the reference to the provided endpoint

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to be called with context providing values for ID and REF. The output conforms to the FHIR PractitionerRole resource structure, specifically focusing on the endpoint attribute.
