### PractitionerRole Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR PractitionerRole resource with an embedded organization reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the PractitionerRole resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated organization |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR PractitionerRole resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "PractitionerRole",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "organization": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "PractitionerRole"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `organization` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required variables (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.
