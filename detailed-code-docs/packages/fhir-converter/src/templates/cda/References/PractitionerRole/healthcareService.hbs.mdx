### PractitionerRole Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR PractitionerRole resource with a reference to a healthcare service. The resource includes an ID and a single healthcare service reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the PractitionerRole resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated healthcare service |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR PractitionerRole resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "PractitionerRole",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "healthcareService": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "PractitionerRole"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `healthcareService` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is specifically designed for use in a FHIR converter, likely in the context of transforming CDA data to FHIR format.
3. The structure follows the FHIR PractitionerRole resource specification, focusing on the healthcare service reference.
4. The template uses minimal Handlebars syntax, only utilizing simple variable substitution for `ID` and `REF`.
