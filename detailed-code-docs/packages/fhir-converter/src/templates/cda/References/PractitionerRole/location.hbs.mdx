### PractitionerRole Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR PractitionerRole resource with a single location reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the PractitionerRole resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated location |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR PractitionerRole resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: Object
  - `resourceType`: "PractitionerRole"
  - `id`: String (from input `ID`)
  - `location`: Array
    - Object
      - `reference`: String (from input `REF`)

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "PractitionerRole"
2. Assigns the input `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `location` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, populated with the input `REF`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input variables (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.
