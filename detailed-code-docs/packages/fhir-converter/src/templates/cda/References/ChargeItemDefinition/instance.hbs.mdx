### ChargeItemDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ChargeItemDefinition resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an instance array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the ChargeItemDefinition resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to another resource that this ChargeItemDefinition instance is associated with |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON structure representing a FHIR ChargeItemDefinition resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the resource type as "ChargeItemDefinition".
2. It sets the resource ID using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. It creates an "instance" array with a single object containing a "reference" field.
4. The "reference" field is populated with the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template does not define an API. It is intended to be used as part of a larger system that generates FHIR resources.
