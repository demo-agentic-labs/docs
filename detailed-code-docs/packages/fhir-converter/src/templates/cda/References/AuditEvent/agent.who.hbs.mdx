### AuditEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an AuditEvent FHIR resource. It specifically defines the `agent.who` field within the AuditEvent structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the AuditEvent resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the agent (who performed the action) |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial AuditEvent FHIR resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an outer object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "AuditEvent".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates an `agent` array with a single object.
5. Within the agent object, sets the `who` field with a `reference` property containing the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for `ID` and `REF`.

## Error Handling
The template doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources, specifically AuditEvents.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The structure follows the FHIR AuditEvent resource specification, but only includes a partial representation focusing on the `agent.who` field.
4. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `ID` and `REF` values to be injected at runtime.
