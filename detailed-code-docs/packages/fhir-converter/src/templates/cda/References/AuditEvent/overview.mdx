## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) AuditEvent resources. These templates are part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific component of the AuditEvent resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of an AuditEvent resource in FHIR format. An AuditEvent resource is used to record when a security-relevant event occurred, such as a user logging in or accessing patient data. The templates in this directory help construct various elements of the AuditEvent, including:

1. The location of the agent who performed the action
2. The identity of the agent who performed the action
3. The entity that was acted upon
4. The observer or source of the audit event

By using these templates, developers can easily generate standardized FHIR AuditEvent resources from CDA data, ensuring consistency and compliance with the FHIR specification.

## Key Files
1. `agent.location.hbs`: Generates the `agent.location` field of the AuditEvent, specifying where the agent was when the event occurred.
2. `agent.who.hbs`: Creates the `agent.who` field, identifying who performed the action being audited.
3. `entity.what.hbs`: Produces the `entity.what` field, referencing the entity that was acted upon during the audited event.
4. `source.observer.hbs`: Constructs the `source.observer` field, indicating who or what observed and recorded the audit event.

Each of these templates generates a partial JSON structure that can be combined to form a complete AuditEvent resource. They all follow a similar pattern:

1. They define a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "AuditEvent".
2. They include an `id` field for the AuditEvent's unique identifier.
3. They focus on a specific element of the AuditEvent (agent, entity, or source).
4. They use placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) for dynamic data insertion.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. Handlebars is a popular templating language that allows for the creation of semantically templated strings.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of placeholders. The main configuration points are:

1. `{{ID}}`: Used to set the unique identifier for the AuditEvent resource.
2. `{{REF}}`: Used to specify references to other resources or entities within the FHIR ecosystem.

These placeholders are expected to be provided with appropriate values when the templates are rendered as part of the larger CDA to FHIR conversion process.

## Notes
1. These templates are part of the FHIR Converter project, which appears to be a tool for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The templates only define partial AuditEvent resources, focusing on specific elements. A complete AuditEvent would likely require combining multiple templates or additional processing.
3. The use of Handlebars allows for dynamic insertion of data when the templates are rendered, providing flexibility in resource generation.
4. All templates include a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating they are part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporate work from Microsoft Corporation, licensed under AGPLv3.
5. The templates strictly adhere to the FHIR specification for AuditEvent resources, ensuring compatibility with FHIR-compliant systems.
6. While these templates provide a solid foundation for generating AuditEvent resources, developers using this system should be aware that additional fields or processing might be necessary to create fully compliant and comprehensive AuditEvent resources in some scenarios.
