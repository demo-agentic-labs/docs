## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR AuditEvent resource structure, specifically focusing on the agent's location. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### AuditEvent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an AuditEvent resource in FHIR format. It specifically defines the `agent.location` field within the AuditEvent resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The identifier for the AuditEvent resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the location of the agent |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial AuditEvent resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "AuditEvent"
  - `id`: Set to the provided `{{ID}}`
  - `agent`: An array with one object containing:
    - `location`: An object with a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}`

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The structure is nested to match the FHIR AuditEvent resource requirements.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger templating system for FHIR conversion.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. It only defines a partial AuditEvent resource, focusing on the agent's location. Other parts of the AuditEvent resource would need to be defined elsewhere.
3. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
4. The use of Handlebars (indicated by the `{{}}` syntax) allows for dynamic insertion of data when the template is rendered.
