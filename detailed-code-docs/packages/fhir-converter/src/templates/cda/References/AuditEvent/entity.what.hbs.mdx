### AuditEvent Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR AuditEvent resource, specifically defining the "entity.what" field. It sets up the basic structure of an AuditEvent with an entity reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the AuditEvent resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the entity being audited |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial AuditEvent resource with the "entity.what" field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an outer object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "AuditEvent".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates an "entity" array with a single object.
5. Within the entity object, creates a "what" object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license by Metriport Inc.
2. The template generates a partial AuditEvent resource. In a complete FHIR implementation, additional fields would likely be required for a valid AuditEvent.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for AuditEvent resources, specifically focusing on the entity.what field, which is used to reference the entity being audited.
