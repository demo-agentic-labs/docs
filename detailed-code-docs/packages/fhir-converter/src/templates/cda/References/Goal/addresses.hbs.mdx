### Goal Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Goal resource with an 'addresses' field. The Goal resource is used to describe desired health states or outcomes for a patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Goal resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource that this Goal addresses |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR Goal resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a 'resource' object with 'resourceType' set to "Goal"
2. Sets the 'id' of the Goal to the provided `{{ID}}`
3. Creates an 'addresses' array with a single object containing a 'reference' field
4. Sets the 'reference' to the provided `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and references to be passed in when rendered.
3. The 'addresses' field in a FHIR Goal resource typically refers to the condition, observation, or other resource that this goal addresses or is intended to address.
4. The JSON structure is not complete (it ends with a comma), suggesting that this template might be part of a larger structure or meant to be combined with other templates.
