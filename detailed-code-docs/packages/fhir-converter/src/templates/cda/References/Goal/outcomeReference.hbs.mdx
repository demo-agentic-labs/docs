## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Goal resource with an outcomeReference. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a Goal with a specific outcome reference.

### Goal Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Goal resource with an outcomeReference. The Goal resource is used to describe desired health states for a patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Goal resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the outcome of the goal |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Goal resource with the following structure:
- A resource object containing:
  - resourceType: "Goal"
  - id: The provided ID
  - outcomeReference: An array with a single object containing a reference to the outcome

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the resourceType to "Goal".
3. It assigns the provided ID to the id field.
4. It creates an outcomeReference array with a single object containing the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The ID and REF values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. If the ID or REF values are not provided when rendering the template, those fields will be empty in the resulting JSON.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The outcomeReference is structured as an array, even though it only contains a single item. This follows the FHIR specification for the Goal resource, where outcomeReference is defined as 0..* (zero to many) references.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and seems to be part of a larger object, as indicated by the comma at the end and the nested structure starting with "resource".
