## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for the "subject" field of a FHIR Goal resource. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure representing a FHIR Goal resource with a focus on the "subject" field. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Goal resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject of the Goal |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Goal resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Goal",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Goal".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the Goal resource.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template itself doesn't define any configuration options, but it expects two variables to be provided when the template is rendered:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The ID to be used for the Goal resource |
| REF | string | The reference to be used for the subject of the Goal |

## Error Handling
The template doesn't include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is likely part of a larger API or interface for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. The specific endpoint or method that uses this template would depend on the overall structure of the conversion system.
