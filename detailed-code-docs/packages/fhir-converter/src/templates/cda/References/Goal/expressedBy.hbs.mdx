### Goal Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Goal resource with an "expressedBy" field. The Goal resource is used to describe a desired state, outcome or objective for a patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Goal resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the entity that expressed the goal |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR Goal resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Goal",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "expressedBy": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Goal".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field of the Goal resource.
3. The `expressedBy` field is populated with a `reference` object containing the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this template expects two inputs to be provided when rendered:

| Input | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| ID    | The unique identifier for the Goal resource |
| REF   | The reference to the entity that expressed the goal |

These inputs should be provided in the context when rendering the Handlebars template.
