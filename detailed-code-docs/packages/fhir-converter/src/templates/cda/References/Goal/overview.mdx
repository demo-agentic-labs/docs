## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating various aspects of FHIR Goal resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR Converter project, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or relationship within the Goal resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR Goal resource. A Goal in FHIR represents a desired health state or outcome for a patient. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of Goal resources with different attributes:

1. The 'addresses' template creates a Goal that addresses a specific reference, such as a condition or observation.
2. The 'expressedBy' template defines a Goal with information about who expressed or set the goal.
3. The 'outcomeReference' template creates a Goal with a reference to its outcome.
4. The 'subject' template defines the subject (typically a patient) for whom the Goal is set.

These templates can be used individually or combined to create a complete Goal resource, depending on the available data and the specific requirements of the FHIR conversion process.

## Key Files

1. `addresses.hbs`: This template creates a Goal resource with an 'addresses' field, which refers to the condition, observation, or other resource that the goal is intended to address.

2. `expressedBy.hbs`: This template creates a Goal resource with an 'expressedBy' field, indicating the entity (e.g., practitioner, patient, or related person) who expressed or set the goal.

3. `outcomeReference.hbs`: This template creates a Goal resource with an 'outcomeReference' field, which points to the outcome of the goal.

4. `subject.hbs`: This template creates a Goal resource with a 'subject' field, typically referring to the patient for whom the goal is set.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Goal",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "{{fieldName}}": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

Where `{{fieldName}}` is replaced by the specific field (addresses, expressedBy, outcomeReference, or subject), and `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are placeholders for the resource ID and reference, respectively.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. The templates are designed to be part of a larger FHIR Converter system, which would provide the necessary context and values for rendering.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include explicit configuration options, they expect certain inputs to be provided when rendered:

- `ID`: A unique identifier for the Goal resource
- `REF`: A reference to another resource, the specific meaning of which depends on the template (e.g., the subject of the goal, the entity expressing the goal, etc.)

These inputs would typically be provided by the larger FHIR Converter system based on the CDA data being processed.

It's important to note that these templates create partial Goal resources, focusing on specific fields. In a complete FHIR conversion process, these templates would likely be combined or used alongside others to create fully-formed Goal resources that comply with the FHIR specification.

The modular nature of these templates allows for flexibility in the conversion process, enabling the creation of Goal resources with different combinations of fields based on the available CDA data and the specific requirements of the FHIR implementation.
