### CareTeam Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CareTeam resource with a single participant member. The CareTeam resource is used to represent a group of practitioners and other individuals participating in the care of a patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CareTeam resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the member of the care team |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR CareTeam resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: Object
  - `resourceType`: "CareTeam"
  - `id`: String (from input `ID`)
  - `participant`: Array
    - Single object with `member` property
      - `reference`: String (from input `REF`)

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a FHIR CareTeam resource structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "CareTeam".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `participant` array with a single object.
5. The participant object contains a `member` property with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

Note: The actual dependencies are not explicitly stated in the code, but the use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) implies a dependency on the Handlebars templating engine.
