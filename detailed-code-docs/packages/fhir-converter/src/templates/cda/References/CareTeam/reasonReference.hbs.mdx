### CareTeam Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR CareTeam resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reasonReference array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CareTeam resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the reason for the CareTeam's existence or activation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR CareTeam resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resourceType to "CareTeam"
2. Assigns the provided ID to the resource
3. Creates a reasonReference array with a single object containing a reference field
4. The reference field is populated with the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used within a FHIR conversion system, likely as part of a larger set of templates for generating various FHIR resources. It expects to receive ID and REF values as input when rendered.
