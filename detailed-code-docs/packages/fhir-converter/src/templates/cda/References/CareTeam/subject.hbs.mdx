### CareTeam Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR CareTeam resource. It specifically defines the `subject` field of the CareTeam, which is a reference to the patient or group receiving care.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CareTeam resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject (patient or group) of the CareTeam |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR CareTeam resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CareTeam",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "CareTeam".
2. It sets the `id` of the CareTeam using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `subject` field is defined as an object with a `reference` property, which is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial CareTeam resource, focusing on the `subject` field. Other fields of the CareTeam resource are not included in this template.
4. The use of placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) suggests that these values are meant to be populated dynamically when the template is rendered.
