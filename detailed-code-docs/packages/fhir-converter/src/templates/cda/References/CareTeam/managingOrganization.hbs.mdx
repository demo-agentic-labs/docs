### CareTeam Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CareTeam resource with a managingOrganization reference. It's structured to be part of a larger FHIR bundle or response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CareTeam resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the managing organization |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR CareTeam resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the CareTeam resource details
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "CareTeam"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the CareTeam
  - `managingOrganization`: An array containing a single object with a reference to the managing organization

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a CareTeam resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "CareTeam".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the CareTeam.
4. It creates a `managingOrganization` array with a single object.
5. The `reference` field of the managing organization is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of Metriport Inc.'s codebase.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as mentioned in the header comments.
3. This template is specifically for the managingOrganization reference of a CareTeam, suggesting there might be other templates for different aspects of CareTeam or other FHIR resources.
4. The JSON structure is not complete (it ends with a comma), indicating this template is likely meant to be part of a larger JSON object or array.
