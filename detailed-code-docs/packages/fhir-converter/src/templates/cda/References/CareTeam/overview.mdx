## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR CareTeam resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect or reference within the CareTeam resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create various parts of a FHIR CareTeam resource. A CareTeam resource in FHIR represents a group of practitioners and other individuals participating in the care of a patient. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of CareTeam resources with different references and properties, such as:

1. Associating a CareTeam with a specific encounter
2. Linking a CareTeam to a managing organization
3. Adding participants (members) to the CareTeam
4. Specifying the organization on behalf of which a participant is acting
5. Providing a reason for the CareTeam's existence or activation
6. Defining the subject (patient or group) of the CareTeam

By using these templates, developers can generate the appropriate JSON structure for each aspect of a CareTeam resource, which can then be combined to form a complete FHIR-compliant CareTeam resource.

## Key Files
1. `encounter.hbs`: Creates a CareTeam resource with an associated encounter reference.
2. `managingOrganization.hbs`: Defines a CareTeam resource with a managing organization reference.
3. `participant.member.hbs`: Generates a CareTeam resource with a single participant member.
4. `participant.onBehalfOf.hbs`: Creates a CareTeam resource with a participant's onBehalfOf reference.
5. `reasonReference.hbs`: Defines a CareTeam resource with a reason reference for its existence or activation.
6. `subject.hbs`: Generates a CareTeam resource with a subject reference (patient or group receiving care).

Each of these templates focuses on a specific aspect of the CareTeam resource, allowing for modular construction of the complete resource.

## Dependencies
These templates are part of the FHIR Converter project and rely on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering. The Handlebars engine is used to process placeholders (e.g., `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) in the templates, allowing for dynamic content insertion when the templates are rendered.

## Configuration
While there are no specific configuration options defined in these templates, they are designed to be flexible and accept input parameters. The common inputs across most templates are:

1. `ID`: A string representing the unique identifier for the CareTeam resource.
2. `REF`: A string containing the reference to the relevant entity (e.g., encounter, organization, participant, reason, or subject).

These inputs are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered within the larger FHIR conversion system.

## Notes
1. All templates in this directory include a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now part of the Metriport Inc. project, licensed under AGPLv3.

2. The templates generate partial FHIR CareTeam resources, each focusing on a specific aspect. To create a complete CareTeam resource, these partial resources would need to be combined and potentially supplemented with additional information.

3. The JSON structures in the templates often include trailing commas, which might need to be handled or removed depending on the JSON parser used in the larger system.

4. Error handling is not explicitly implemented in these templates. They assume that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided correctly when the templates are rendered.

5. The modular nature of these templates allows for flexibility in constructing CareTeam resources with different combinations of properties and references, depending on the specific requirements of the CDA to FHIR conversion process.
