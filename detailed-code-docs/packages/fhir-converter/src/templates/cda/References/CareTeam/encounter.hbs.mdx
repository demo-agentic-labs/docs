### CareTeam Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CareTeam resource with an encounter reference. It's a partial representation of a CareTeam, focusing on the encounter association.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CareTeam resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR CareTeam resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: Object
  - `resourceType`: "CareTeam"
  - `id`: String (from input)
  - `encounter`: Object
    - `reference`: String (from input)

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to inject the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be a partial representation of a CareTeam resource, focusing only on the encounter reference. In a complete FHIR CareTeam resource, there would typically be additional fields such as participants, status, and subject.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now part of the Metriport Inc. project, licensed under AGPLv3.
3. The use of double curly braces `{{}}` indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
4. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which might need to be handled or removed depending on the JSON parser used in the larger system.
