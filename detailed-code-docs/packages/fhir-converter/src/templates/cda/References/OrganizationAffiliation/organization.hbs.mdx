### OrganizationAffiliation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an OrganizationAffiliation resource, which is used to represent relationships between organizations in healthcare settings.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the OrganizationAffiliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated organization |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing an OrganizationAffiliation resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "OrganizationAffiliation"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `organization`: An object containing the reference to the associated organization

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "OrganizationAffiliation".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. The `organization` field is populated with an object containing a `reference` field, which is set using the `{{REF}}` input.
