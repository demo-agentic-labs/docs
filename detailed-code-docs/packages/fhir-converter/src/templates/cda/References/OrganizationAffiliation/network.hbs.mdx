### OrganizationAffiliation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an OrganizationAffiliation FHIR resource. It includes a single network reference within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the OrganizationAffiliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the network organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing an OrganizationAffiliation FHIR resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "OrganizationAffiliation".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "network" array with a single object containing a "reference" property.
5. Sets the "reference" value to the provided REF input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering the JSON structure with dynamic values.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template does not define an API. It is meant to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion system.
