### OrganizationAffiliation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an OrganizationAffiliation resource with an endpoint reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the OrganizationAffiliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the endpoint associated with this OrganizationAffiliation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing an OrganizationAffiliation resource with an endpoint reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "OrganizationAffiliation"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates an "endpoint" array with a single object containing a "reference" field
5. Sets the "reference" value to the provided REF input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF variables will be provided and valid.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3.
2. The structure follows the FHIR resource format for OrganizationAffiliation.
3. The endpoint is represented as an array, allowing for potential expansion to multiple endpoints if needed in the future.
4. The template uses minimal formatting and whitespace, likely to reduce the size of the output JSON.
