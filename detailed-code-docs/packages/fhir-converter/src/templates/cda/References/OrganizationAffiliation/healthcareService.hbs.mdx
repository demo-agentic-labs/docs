## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template that defines the structure for an OrganizationAffiliation resource in FHIR format. It specifically focuses on the healthcareService field of the OrganizationAffiliation resource.

### OrganizationAffiliation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an OrganizationAffiliation resource with a healthcareService field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the OrganizationAffiliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the healthcare service |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing an OrganizationAffiliation resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a resource object with resourceType "OrganizationAffiliation"
2. Sets the id of the resource using the provided ID input
3. Creates a healthcareService array with a single object containing a reference field
4. Sets the reference field using the provided REF input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders (\{\{ID\}\} and \{\{REF\}\}).

## Configuration
The template is configured to output a specific structure for the OrganizationAffiliation resource. The structure is fixed, with only the id and healthcareService.reference fields being variable.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (\{\{...\}\}) for variable substitution.
3. The output is a JSON structure, but it's not a complete JSON object. It appears to be designed to be part of a larger JSON structure, possibly an array of resources.
4. The healthcareService field is an array, but it only contains one element in this template.
5. The trailing commas in the JSON structure might cause issues with strict JSON parsers and may need to be removed in the final output.
