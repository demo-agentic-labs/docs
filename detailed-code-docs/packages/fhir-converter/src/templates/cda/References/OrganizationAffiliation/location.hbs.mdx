### OrganizationAffiliation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an OrganizationAffiliation resource with a focus on the location attribute.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the OrganizationAffiliation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated location |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing an OrganizationAffiliation resource with location information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "OrganizationAffiliation".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "location" array with a single object containing a "reference" field.
5. The "reference" field is populated with the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license by Metriport Inc.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger FHIR resource bundle, as indicated by the trailing commas.
4. The location array is hardcoded to contain only one element. If multiple locations need to be supported, the template would need to be modified.
