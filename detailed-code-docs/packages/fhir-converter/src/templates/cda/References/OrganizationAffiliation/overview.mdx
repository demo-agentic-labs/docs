## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating various aspects of the OrganizationAffiliation resource in FHIR format. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific attribute of the OrganizationAffiliation resource, such as endpoint, healthcareService, location, network, organization, and participatingOrganization.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of an OrganizationAffiliation resource in FHIR format. When used in the FHIR converter system, they allow for the transformation of CDA data into standardized FHIR resources. Each template takes specific inputs (typically an ID and a reference) and outputs a JSON object that represents a part of the OrganizationAffiliation resource. These parts can then be combined to form a complete OrganizationAffiliation resource.

## Key Files
1. **endpoint.hbs**: Creates the endpoint reference for an OrganizationAffiliation resource.
2. **healthcareService.hbs**: Defines the healthcareService reference for an OrganizationAffiliation resource.
3. **location.hbs**: Specifies the location reference for an OrganizationAffiliation resource.
4. **network.hbs**: Creates the network reference for an OrganizationAffiliation resource.
5. **organization.hbs**: Defines the primary organization reference for an OrganizationAffiliation resource.
6. **participatingOrganization.hbs**: Specifies the participating organization reference for an OrganizationAffiliation resource.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "OrganizationAffiliation",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "specificAttribute": [
      {
        "reference": "{{REF}}"
      }
    ]
  }
},
```

Where `specificAttribute` is replaced by the relevant attribute (e.g., endpoint, healthcareService, etc.) for each template.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering. They are designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, likely with other components that handle the actual data transformation and template rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in these templates. They are designed to be used as-is, with the expectation that the necessary input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the templates are rendered.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they incorporate work from Microsoft Corporation but are now licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.
2. The templates use minimal formatting and whitespace, likely to reduce the size of the output JSON.
3. The JSON structures in these templates are not complete and appear to be fragments of a larger FHIR resource bundle, as indicated by the trailing commas.
4. Each template focuses on a single attribute of the OrganizationAffiliation resource, allowing for modular composition of the complete resource.
5. Error handling is not implemented within these templates. It's assumed that error handling and input validation are managed by the larger system using these templates.
6. The templates are designed to be flexible, allowing for easy modification if multiple references need to be supported in the future.

These templates play a crucial role in the FHIR conversion process, enabling the standardized representation of organizational relationships and affiliations in healthcare settings. They provide a foundation for interoperability and data exchange between different healthcare systems and organizations.
