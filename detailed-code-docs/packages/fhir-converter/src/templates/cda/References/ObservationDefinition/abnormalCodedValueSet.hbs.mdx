## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for creating an ObservationDefinition resource in FHIR format. It specifically defines the `abnormalCodedValueSet` property of the ObservationDefinition, which is used to reference a value set that defines abnormal coded values for the observation.

### ObservationDefinition Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for an ObservationDefinition resource with an `abnormalCodedValueSet` property.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the ObservationDefinition resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the value set that defines abnormal coded values |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing an ObservationDefinition resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "ObservationDefinition".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates an `abnormalCodedValueSet` object with a `reference` property set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of an ObservationDefinition resource, focusing specifically on the `abnormalCodedValueSet` property.
3. The output JSON structure is nested, with the actual ObservationDefinition resource contained within a `resource` object. This suggests that the template might be used as part of a larger FHIR bundle or transaction.
