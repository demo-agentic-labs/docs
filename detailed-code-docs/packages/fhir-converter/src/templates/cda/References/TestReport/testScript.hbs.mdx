### TestReport Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR TestReport resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reference to a TestScript.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the TestReport resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated TestScript |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON representation of a FHIR TestReport resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "TestReport"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `testScript` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for Handlebars variable substitution.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the trailing commas and the nesting structure.
