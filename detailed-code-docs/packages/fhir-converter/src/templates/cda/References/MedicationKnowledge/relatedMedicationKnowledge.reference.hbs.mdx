### MedicationKnowledge Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a `relatedMedicationKnowledge` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to related medication knowledge |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "MedicationKnowledge"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `relatedMedicationKnowledge`: An array containing a single object with:
    - `reference`: An array with a single object containing:
      - `reference`: The reference to related medication knowledge

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationKnowledge"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `relatedMedicationKnowledge` array with a single object
4. Within that object, creates a `reference` array with a single object
5. Assigns the provided `REF` to the `reference` field of the innermost object

## Dependencies

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template does not define an API or public interface. It is meant to be used as part of a larger system that handles FHIR resource generation.
