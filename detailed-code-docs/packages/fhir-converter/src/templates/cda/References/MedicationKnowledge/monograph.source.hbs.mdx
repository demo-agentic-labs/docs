### MedicationKnowledge Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a MedicationKnowledge FHIR resource, specifically focusing on the `monograph` field. It creates a JSON object representing the resource with placeholders for dynamic content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the monograph source |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a MedicationKnowledge FHIR resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the FHIR resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "MedicationKnowledge"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `monograph`: An array containing a single object with a `source` field
    - `source`: An object with a `reference` field containing the monograph source reference

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values:
   - `{{ID}}` is used to set the `id` field of the resource
   - `{{REF}}` is used to set the `reference` field within the `source` object
2. The structure follows the FHIR specification for MedicationKnowledge resources, focusing specifically on the `monograph` field

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The dynamic content is expected to be provided when the template is rendered.
