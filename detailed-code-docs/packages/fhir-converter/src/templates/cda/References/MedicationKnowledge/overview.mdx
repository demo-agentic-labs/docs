## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR MedicationKnowledge resources. These templates are part of a FHIR converter, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or section of the MedicationKnowledge resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of MedicationKnowledge resources in FHIR format. They cover different aspects of medication information, such as:

1. Administration guidelines
2. Associated medications
3. Contraindications
4. Ingredients
5. Manufacturers
6. Monograph sources
7. Regulatory information
8. Related medication knowledge

Each template takes specific inputs (typically an ID and a reference) and generates a portion of the MedicationKnowledge resource. These can be combined to create a complete resource or used individually to update specific parts of an existing resource.

## Key Files
1. `administrationGuidelines.indicationReference.hbs`: Generates the administration guidelines section with indication references.
2. `associatedMedication.hbs`: Creates an associated medication reference.
3. `contraindication.hbs`: Adds contraindication information to the resource.
4. `ingredient.itemReference.hbs`: Specifies ingredient information using item references.
5. `manufacturer.hbs`: Includes manufacturer details in the resource.
6. `monograph.source.hbs`: Adds monograph source information.
7. `regulatory.regulatoryAuthority.hbs`: Incorporates regulatory authority details.
8. `relatedMedicationKnowledge.reference.hbs`: Adds references to related medication knowledge.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, using Handlebars syntax to create a JSON object representing a part of the MedicationKnowledge resource. They all accept an `ID` input for the resource identifier and a `REF` input for the specific reference being added.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, likely implemented in a JavaScript environment.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have explicit configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of input variables. The two main inputs used across all templates are:

1. `ID`: The unique identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource.
2. `REF`: A reference to the specific entity being added (e.g., associated medication, manufacturer, etc.).

These inputs allow the templates to be dynamically populated with the appropriate data during the conversion process.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how the `manufacturer.hbs` template might be used:

```javascript
const Handlebars = require('handlebars');
const fs = require('fs');

// Load the template
const templateSource = fs.readFileSync('manufacturer.hbs', 'utf8');
const template = Handlebars.compile(templateSource);

// Render the template with specific data
const result = template({
  ID: "med-knowledge-123",
  REF: "Organization/manufacturer-456"
});

console.log(JSON.parse(result));
```

This would output:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "MedicationKnowledge",
    "id": "med-knowledge-123",
    "manufacturer": {
      "reference": "Organization/manufacturer-456"
    }
  }
}
```

Similar usage patterns would apply to the other templates in this directory, with the specific fields and structure varying based on the particular aspect of the MedicationKnowledge resource being generated.
