### MedicationKnowledge Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a MedicationKnowledge resource in FHIR format, with emphasis on the regulatory authority information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the regulatory authority |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource with regulatory information.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a MedicationKnowledge resource structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationKnowledge".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. In the `regulatory` array, it includes an object with `regulatoryAuthority` information.
5. The `regulatoryAuthority` is set as a reference using the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the regulatory authority |

## Error Handling
This template does not implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used with a FHIR API that accepts MedicationKnowledge resources. The output JSON structure conforms to the FHIR specification for MedicationKnowledge resources, specifically focusing on the regulatory authority information.
