## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource with a contraindication reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### MedicationKnowledge Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a MedicationKnowledge resource with a focus on the contraindication field. It's a partial template that would likely be used as part of a larger FHIR document generation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the contraindication resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the FHIR resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "MedicationKnowledge"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `contraindication`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `contraindication` field is an array, suggesting that multiple contraindications could be added, although this template only includes one.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in JavaScript environments for generating HTML or, in this case, JSON structures.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The structure is fixed, with only the `ID` and `REF` values being variable.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the system using this template to generate FHIR resources.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for generating part of a FHIR resource. It would typically be used as part of a larger system that handles the full FHIR resource generation and API interactions.
