### MedicationKnowledge Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource, particularly focusing on the `administrationGuidelines` and `indicationReference` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the indication for the medication administration guideline |

#### Outputs
The template generates a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "MedicationKnowledge"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `administrationGuidelines`: An array containing administration guidelines
    - `indicationReference`: A reference to the indication for the guideline

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure.
2. The `administrationGuidelines` is an array with a single object, which contains the `indicationReference`.
3. The `indicationReference` is an object with a single `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Logging
There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template does not define an API. It is designed to be used within a larger system that can provide the necessary input values and process the resulting JSON output.
