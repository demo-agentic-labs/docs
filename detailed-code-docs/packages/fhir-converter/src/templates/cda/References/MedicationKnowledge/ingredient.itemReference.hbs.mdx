### MedicationKnowledge Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource, focusing on the ingredient information. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and the ingredient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the ingredient item |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "MedicationKnowledge"
- id: The provided ID
- ingredient: An array containing a single object with:
  - itemReference: An object with a reference to the ingredient

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the resourceType to "MedicationKnowledge".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the resource id.
4. In the ingredient array, it creates an object with an itemReference.
5. The itemReference uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder to set the reference value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the ID and REF placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that valid values will be provided for the ID and REF placeholders. If these values are missing or invalid, it may result in an incomplete or invalid JSON structure.

## Notes
1. The template is wrapped in a copyright and license notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be part of a larger system for converting clinical document architecture (CDA) to FHIR format, as indicated by its location in the file structure.
3. The JSON structure is not complete on its own and is likely meant to be combined with other data or nested within a larger FHIR Bundle resource.
