### MedicationKnowledge Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource with a manufacturer reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and manufacturer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the MedicationKnowledge resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the manufacturer resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicationKnowledge",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "manufacturer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a fixed structure for the MedicationKnowledge resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to insert dynamic values for the resource ID and manufacturer reference.
3. The `resourceType` is set to "MedicationKnowledge" to conform to FHIR specifications.
4. The `manufacturer` field is populated with a reference object, which includes the provided reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR conversion processes.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that valid values will be provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders. Error handling would typically be managed by the system using this template.
