## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR Medication resources as part of a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion process. The templates focus on specific aspects of a Medication resource, namely the ingredient's item reference and the manufacturer information.

## What does it do?
These templates are used to convert clinical data from CDA format to FHIR format, specifically for creating Medication resources. They generate JSON structures that represent different parts of a Medication resource:

1. The ingredient template creates a structure for referencing an ingredient of a medication.
2. The manufacturer template creates a structure for referencing the manufacturer of a medication.

These templates are likely used as part of a larger conversion process, where they are combined with other templates to create complete FHIR Medication resources.

## Key Files

1. `ingredient.itemReference.hbs`: This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Medication resource, focusing on the ingredient's item reference. It creates an `ingredient` array with a single object containing an `itemReference` that points to another resource.

2. `manufacturer.hbs`: This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Medication resource, focusing on the manufacturer information. It creates a `manufacturer` object with a reference to the manufacturer of the medication.

Both templates follow a similar structure:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Medication",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    // Specific properties for each template
  }
}
```

The specific properties are:

For `ingredient.itemReference.hbs`:
```json
"ingredient": [
  {
    "itemReference": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
]
```

For `manufacturer.hbs`:
```json
"manufacturer": {
  "reference": "{{REF}}"
}
```

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) and generate the final JSON structures.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in these templates. They use Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to allow for dynamic insertion of values when the templates are rendered.

## Notes
1. Both templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the Microsoft portion is provided under a more permissive license.
3. These templates are designed to be part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
4. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of a Medication resource and does not include other potential properties. They are likely used in combination with other templates to create complete Medication resources.
5. The templates assume that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when rendered. There is no explicit error handling for missing values.
6. The ingredient template allows for only one ingredient to be specified. If multiple ingredients are needed, the template would need to be modified or used multiple times.

These templates play a crucial role in the CDA to FHIR conversion process, ensuring that medication data is accurately represented in the FHIR format. They provide a standardized way to structure medication information, which is essential for interoperability in healthcare systems.
