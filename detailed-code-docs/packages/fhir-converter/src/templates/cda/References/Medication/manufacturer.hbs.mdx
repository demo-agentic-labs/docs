### Medication Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object for a FHIR Medication resource, including the resourceType, id, and manufacturer information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Medication resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the manufacturer of the medication |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing a FHIR Medication resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Medication"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `manufacturer` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering the JSON structure with dynamic values.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to allow for dynamic insertion of values when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is specifically designed for the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure (`packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/Medication/`).
3. The generated JSON structure follows the FHIR specification for a Medication resource, focusing on the manufacturer information.
4. The template is designed to be part of a larger system, likely used in conjunction with other templates to generate complete FHIR resources.
