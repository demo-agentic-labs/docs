### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Medication resource. It specifically focuses on the ingredient's item reference, which is a key component in describing the composition of a medication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Medication resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to another resource that represents the ingredient |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Medication resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "Medication"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this Medication resource
  - `ingredient`: An array containing a single object with:
    - `itemReference`: An object with a `reference` property pointing to another resource

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Medication resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Medication".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` of the resource.
4. In the `ingredient` array, it creates an object with an `itemReference`.
5. The `itemReference` object contains a `reference` property, which is set using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the Microsoft portion is provided under a more permissive license.
3. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
4. This template focuses solely on the ingredient's item reference and does not include other potential properties of a Medication resource.
5. The structure allows for only one ingredient to be specified. If multiple ingredients are needed, the template would need to be modified or used multiple times.
