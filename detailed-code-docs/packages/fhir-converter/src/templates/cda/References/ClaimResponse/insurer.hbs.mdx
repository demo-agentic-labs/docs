### ClaimResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ClaimResponse resource with an emphasis on the insurer field. It's structured to be included in a larger FHIR resource compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ClaimResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurer |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ClaimResponse resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" as "ClaimResponse"
   - "id" using the provided {{ID}} input
   - "insurer" as an object with a "reference" field, populated by the {{REF}} input

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation, indicated by double curly braces ({{ }}).

## Error Handling
This template does not implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the necessary input variables (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No specific logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
