### ClaimResponse Template
#### Description
This template generates a FHIR ClaimResponse resource with an emphasis on the insurance section. It includes placeholders for an ID and a reference to another claim response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ClaimResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another claim response |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | Object | A FHIR-compliant ClaimResponse resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "ClaimResponse"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates an "insurance" array with a single object
5. Within the insurance object, creates a "claimResponse" object with a "reference" property
6. Sets the "reference" value to the provided REF input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering the JSON structure with dynamic values.

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation (e.g., `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`).
