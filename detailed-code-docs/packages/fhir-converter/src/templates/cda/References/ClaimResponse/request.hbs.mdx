### ClaimResponse Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR ClaimResponse resource. It specifically defines the `request` field, which is a reference to the claim that this response is addressing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for this ClaimResponse resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the related claim |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ClaimResponse resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ClaimResponse"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `request`: An object containing:
    - `reference`: A reference to the related claim

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. Error handling would typically be managed by the system rendering the template.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is focused solely on the `request` field of a ClaimResponse resource. It's likely part of a larger set of templates used to construct complete FHIR resources.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be combined with other partial structures to form a complete ClaimResponse resource.
