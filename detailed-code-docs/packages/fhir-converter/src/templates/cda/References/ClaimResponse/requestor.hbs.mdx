### ClaimResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR ClaimResponse resource. It specifically defines the "requestor" field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ClaimResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the requestor |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ClaimResponse resource with the following structure:
- A "resource" object containing:
  - "resourceType": Set to "ClaimResponse"
  - "id": Set to the provided ID
  - "requestor": An object with a "reference" field set to the provided REF

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided ID and REF values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion process.
