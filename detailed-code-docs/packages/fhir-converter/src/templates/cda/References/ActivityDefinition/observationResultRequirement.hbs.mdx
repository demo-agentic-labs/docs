### ActivityDefinition Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR ActivityDefinition resource. It includes placeholders for an ID and a reference to an observation result requirement.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ActivityDefinition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the observation result requirement |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing the ActivityDefinition resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" to "ActivityDefinition"
   - "id" to the provided {{ID}} value
   - "observationResultRequirement" as an array with one object containing a "reference" property set to the provided {{REF}} value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The values for ID and REF are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## TODOs
The template includes a comprehensive copyright and permission notice at the beginning, which covers both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation. This notice should be reviewed and maintained as necessary.
