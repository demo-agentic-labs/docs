## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource with a productReference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR document conversion process, specifically for handling product references within activity definitions.

### ActivityDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource structure with a focus on the productReference field. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and product reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the ActivityDefinition resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the product associated with this activity definition |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource with the following key elements:
- resourceType: Set to "ActivityDefinition"
- id: The unique identifier for the resource
- productReference: An object containing a reference to the associated product

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to insert the provided values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure. This allows for dynamic generation of the ActivityDefinition resource based on the input data.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in the FHIR Converter project for transforming various healthcare document formats into FHIR resources.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined within this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the Handlebars placeholders at runtime.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. Error management would typically be handled by the system using this template, such as validating input data before applying the template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The structure of the output JSON suggests that this template is likely used as part of a larger FHIR document, where multiple resources are combined to form a complete FHIR representation.
3. The template only defines a partial ActivityDefinition resource. In a full FHIR document, additional fields might be required or included depending on the specific use case and data availability.
