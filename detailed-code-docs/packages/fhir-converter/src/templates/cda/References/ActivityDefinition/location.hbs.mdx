### ActivityDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource structure with a location reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and location reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the ActivityDefinition resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the location associated with this ActivityDefinition |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ActivityDefinition"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `location`: An object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for an ActivityDefinition resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ActivityDefinition".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to insert the provided ID for the resource.
4. It creates a `location` object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder to insert the provided location reference.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with a Handlebars templating engine, which is used to process the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed for `ID` and `REF` when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR resource generation system, as it only defines a partial resource structure.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template uses strict JSON formatting, which is important for generating valid FHIR resources.
4. The `location` property in the ActivityDefinition resource is used to specify where the activity should occur, which could be a reference to a Location resource or another resource type that represents a location.
