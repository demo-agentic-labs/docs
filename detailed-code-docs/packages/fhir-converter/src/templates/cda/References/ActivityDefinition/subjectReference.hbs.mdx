### ActivityDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource structure with a `subjectReference` field. It's likely part of a larger template system for converting CDA to FHIR.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The identifier for the ActivityDefinition resource |
| REF  | String | The reference value for the subject |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a nested JSON structure with a `resource` object.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "ActivityDefinition".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `subjectReference` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the ActivityDefinition's ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the subject reference |
