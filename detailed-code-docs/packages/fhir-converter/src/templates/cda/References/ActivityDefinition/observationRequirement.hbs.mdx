## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource with an observationRequirement. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### ActivityDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource with an observationRequirement. It's structured as a JSON object representing the FHIR resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ActivityDefinition resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the observationRequirement |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ActivityDefinition resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the FHIR resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ActivityDefinition"
  - `id`: The identifier of the resource (from the `ID` input)
  - `observationRequirement`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` field (from the `REF` input)

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for an ActivityDefinition resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ActivityDefinition".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates an `observationRequirement` array with a single object.
5. The object in the `observationRequirement` array has a `reference` field set to the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of an ActivityDefinition resource. In a complete FHIR resource, there would likely be additional fields and possibly multiple observationRequirements.
3. The JSON structure is not complete (it's not a valid JSON object on its own) and is likely meant to be included as part of a larger JSON structure or template.
