## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR TestScript resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically focusing on creating TestScript resources with fixtures and profiles. The templates are designed to generate JSON structures that conform to the FHIR specification for TestScript resources.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory are used to create standardized JSON representations of FHIR TestScript resources. These resources are typically used in testing scenarios for FHIR implementations. The templates allow for the creation of:

1. TestScript resources with fixtures: These are used to define specific resources that will be used during the execution of a test script.
2. TestScript resources with profiles: These define the FHIR profiles that are relevant to the test script.

By using these templates, developers can easily generate consistent and valid FHIR TestScript resources, which can then be used in various FHIR-related testing and validation processes.

## Key Files

1. fixture.resource.hbs
   - Purpose: Generates a TestScript resource with a fixture element.
   - Key features:
     - Creates a JSON structure for a TestScript resource
     - Includes a single fixture with a reference to another resource
     - Uses placeholders for TestScript ID and fixture resource reference

2. profile.hbs
   - Purpose: Generates a TestScript resource with a profile reference.
   - Key features:
     - Creates a JSON structure for a TestScript resource
     - Includes a single profile reference
     - Uses placeholders for TestScript ID and profile reference

Both templates follow a similar structure, creating a JSON object with a "resource" property, setting the "resourceType" to "TestScript", and including specific elements (fixture or profile) based on their purpose.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. The Handlebars engine is not explicitly included in this directory but is a crucial dependency for rendering these templates.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the templates use placeholders that act as configuration points:

- {{ID}}: Used in both templates to set the TestScript resource ID
- {{REF}}: Used in fixture.resource.hbs to set the fixture resource reference
- {{REF}}: Used in profile.hbs to set the profile reference

These placeholders would be replaced with actual values when the templates are rendered, allowing for dynamic generation of TestScript resources.

## Notes
1. Both templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are based on work by Microsoft but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.

2. The JSON structures in the templates include trailing commas, which are not valid in standard JSON. This might be intentional if the templates are part of a larger structure or if the rendering engine removes trailing commas.

3. The templates use double quotes for JSON property names and values, which is the correct format for JSON.

4. There is no explicit error handling in these templates. They assume that the required placeholder values (ID and REF) will be provided when the templates are rendered.

5. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR resources. The TestScript resources generated by these templates would likely be used in testing and validation processes related to this conversion.

Example usage of fixture.resource.hbs:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "TestScript",
    "id": "example-fixture-id",
    "fixture": [
      {
        "resource": {
          "reference": "Patient/example-patient-id"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Example usage of profile.hbs:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "TestScript",
    "id": "example-profile-id",
    "profile": [
      {
        "reference": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

These examples demonstrate how the templates would be rendered with specific values for the ID and REF placeholders, resulting in valid FHIR TestScript resources.
