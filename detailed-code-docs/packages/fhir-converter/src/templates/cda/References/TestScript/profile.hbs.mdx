### TestScript Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR TestScript resource. It includes a resource type, an ID, and a profile reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the TestScript resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the profile |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR TestScript resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "TestScript"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `profile` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. The structure of the TestScript resource is fixed, with placeholders for dynamic values.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The JSON structure is not strictly valid as it includes trailing commas, which are not allowed in standard JSON. This might be intentional if the template is part of a larger structure or if the rendering engine removes trailing commas.
3. The template uses double quotes for JSON property names and values, which is the correct format for JSON.
