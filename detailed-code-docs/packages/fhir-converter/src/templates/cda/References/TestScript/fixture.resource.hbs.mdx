### Main Template
#### Description
The template defines a JSON structure for a TestScript resource with a single fixture. It uses two placeholders: `{{ID}}` for the TestScript's id and `{{REF}}` for the fixture's resource reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the TestScript resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource used in the fixture |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a TestScript resource with a fixture |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "TestScript"
3. Assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the "id" field
4. Creates a "fixture" array with a single object
5. Within the fixture object, creates a "resource" object with a "reference" property set to `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.
