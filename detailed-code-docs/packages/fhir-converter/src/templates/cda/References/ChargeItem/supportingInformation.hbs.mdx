### ChargeItem Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource with a focus on the `supportingInformation` field. It provides a structure for including supporting information references in a ChargeItem resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ChargeItem resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource with the `supportingInformation` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "ChargeItem".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. The `supportingInformation` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` property, which is set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is designed to work within the Handlebars templating system.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the CDA to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure (`packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/ChargeItem/`).
3. This template provides a partial resource structure and would typically be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR ChargeItem resource.
4. The `supportingInformation` array in this template only includes a single reference. In a full FHIR ChargeItem resource, this array could potentially contain multiple references to supporting information.
