## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) ChargeItem resource with a focus on the `productReference` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format, specifically for referencing a product associated with a charge item.

### ChargeItem Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource structure with a `productReference` field. It's intended to be used as part of a larger FHIR document or resource compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the ChargeItem resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the product associated with the charge item |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure for a FHIR resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ChargeItem".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the ChargeItem.
4. It creates a `productReference` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `ID` and `REF` values to be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
3. This template represents only a partial ChargeItem resource. In a complete FHIR document, additional fields and nested resources would likely be required to fully represent a ChargeItem.
4. The use of double curly braces (`{{}}`) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
