### ChargeItem Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource with a focus on the `performingOrganization` field. It sets up the basic structure of a ChargeItem resource and populates the `performingOrganization` with a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ChargeItem resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performing organization |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource with the `performingOrganization` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "ChargeItem".
3. It sets the `id` of the ChargeItem using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. It creates a `performingOrganization` object with a `reference` property, populated by the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`), which allow for dynamic content insertion when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of Metriport Inc.'s codebase.
2. The template is specifically for the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure.
3. This template represents only a partial ChargeItem resource. In a complete FHIR resource, there would likely be additional fields and nested structures.
4. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) suggests that this template is meant to be populated with data from a CDA document or some intermediate data structure during the conversion process.
