### ChargeItem Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR ChargeItem resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a context reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the ChargeItem resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the context of the ChargeItem |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON representation of a FHIR ChargeItem resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ChargeItem"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `context` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions as stated in the notice.
3. The template is part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR resources.
4. The generated JSON structure is nested within a `resource` object, suggesting it might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
