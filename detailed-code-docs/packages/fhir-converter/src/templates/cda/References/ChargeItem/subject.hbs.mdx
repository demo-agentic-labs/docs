### ChargeItem Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource with a focus on the `subject` field. It's structured to be included as part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource collection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ChargeItem resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the ChargeItem |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ChargeItem".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
- `{{ID}}`: Placeholder for the ChargeItem's unique identifier
- `{{REF}}`: Placeholder for the subject's reference

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. It only defines a partial ChargeItem resource, focusing on the `subject` field. Other fields of the ChargeItem resource are not included in this template.
3. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of the Metriport Inc. project under the AGPLv3 license.
