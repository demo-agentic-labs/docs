### ChargeItem Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ChargeItem resource with a costCenter reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the cost center reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the ChargeItem resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the cost center associated with this charge item |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON structure representing a FHIR ChargeItem resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR ChargeItem resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ChargeItem".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `costCenter` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder to set its value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to FHIR format.
3. The generated JSON structure is not a complete FHIR resource on its own; it's likely meant to be combined with other data to form a complete ChargeItem resource.
4. The template focuses solely on the `costCenter` element of a ChargeItem resource, suggesting that other aspects of the ChargeItem might be handled by separate templates or processes.
