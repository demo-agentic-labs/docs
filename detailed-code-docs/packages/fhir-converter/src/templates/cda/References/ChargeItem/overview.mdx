## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various components of FHIR ChargeItem resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect or field of a ChargeItem resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR ChargeItem resource. A ChargeItem in FHIR represents a billable item or service provided to a patient. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various references within a ChargeItem, such as:

1. The account associated with the charge
2. The context in which the charge was incurred
3. The cost center responsible for the charge
4. The person who entered the charge information
5. Other ChargeItems that this item is part of
6. The performer of the service
7. The organization performing the service
8. The product or service being charged for
9. The organization requesting the service
10. The subject (usually the patient) of the charge
11. Any supporting information for the charge

Each template generates a JSON structure for its specific part of the ChargeItem resource, which can then be combined to form a complete resource.

## Key Files
1. `account.hbs`: Creates a reference to the associated account
2. `context.hbs`: Defines the context of the charge
3. `costCenter.hbs`: References the cost center for the charge
4. `enterer.hbs`: Specifies the person who entered the charge information
5. `partOf.hbs`: Links to other ChargeItems that this item is part of
6. `performer.actor.hbs`: Identifies the performer of the service
7. `performingOrganization.hbs`: References the organization performing the service
8. `productReference.hbs`: Links to the product or service being charged
9. `requestingOrganization.hbs`: Specifies the organization requesting the service
10. `service.hbs`: Defines the service associated with the charge
11. `subject.hbs`: Identifies the subject of the charge (usually the patient)
12. `supportingInformation.hbs`: Includes references to supporting information for the charge

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource with a focus on its specific field. They all use Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation, typically expecting an `ID` for the resource and a `REF` for the specific reference being created.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated with other components that handle the overall conversion process from CDA to FHIR format.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`). These placeholders allow for dynamic content insertion when the templates are rendered, based on the input data from the CDA document or an intermediate data structure.

The templates are meant to be used as part of a larger conversion process, where the appropriate values for these placeholders would be provided by the conversion system based on the input CDA data.
