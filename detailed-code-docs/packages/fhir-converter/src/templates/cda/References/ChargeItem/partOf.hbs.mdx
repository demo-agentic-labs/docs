### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ChargeItem resource, specifically defining the `partOf` field. The `partOf` field is used to reference other ChargeItems that this ChargeItem is a part of.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the ChargeItem resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to another ChargeItem that this ChargeItem is a part of |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource with the `partOf` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "ChargeItem".
2. It sets the `id` of the ChargeItem using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `partOf` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc.
- The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `ID` and `REF` values to be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
- This template only defines a partial ChargeItem resource, focusing solely on the `partOf` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates to create a complete ChargeItem resource.
