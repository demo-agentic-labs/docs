### ChargeItem Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ChargeItem resource with a requestingOrganization reference. It's a partial template, likely to be used as part of a larger FHIR document construction process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ChargeItem resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the requesting organization |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ChargeItem resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "ChargeItem".
2. Sets the `id` of the ChargeItem to the provided `{{ID}}`.
3. Defines a `requestingOrganization` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Placeholder for the ChargeItem resource ID |
| REF | String | Placeholder for the requesting organization reference |

1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the ID and reference to be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
3. This template appears to be a partial representation of a ChargeItem resource, focusing specifically on the requestingOrganization field. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource or document.
