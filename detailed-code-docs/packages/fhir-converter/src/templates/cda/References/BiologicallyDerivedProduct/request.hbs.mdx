### BiologicallyDerivedProduct Resource Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource in FHIR format. It includes basic identification and a reference to a related request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated request |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "BiologicallyDerivedProduct"
- id: The provided ID
- request: An array containing a single object with a reference to the associated request

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided ID and REF values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders will be replaced with the actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering the JSON structure with the provided input values.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The structure of the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource is fixed, with only the ID and request reference being customizable through input variables.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template does not define an API but rather provides a structure for generating a FHIR BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource. The resulting JSON can be used as part of a FHIR API request or response.
