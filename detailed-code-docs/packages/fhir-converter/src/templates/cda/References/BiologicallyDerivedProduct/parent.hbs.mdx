### BiologicallyDerivedProduct Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource, which is part of the FHIR standard. It includes an ID and a parent reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the parent resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure with a `resource` object.
2. Within the `resource` object, it sets:
   - `resourceType` as "BiologicallyDerivedProduct"
   - `id` using the `{{ID}}` input
   - `parent` as an array with a single object containing a `reference` property set to `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.
