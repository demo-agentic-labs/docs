### BiologicallyDerivedProduct Template
#### Description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource in FHIR format. It specifically includes the collection and collector information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the collector of the biologically derived product |

#### Outputs
The template generates a JSON object representing a FHIR BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "BiologicallyDerivedProduct"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the resource's `id` field
3. Creates a `collection` object within the resource
4. Within the `collection` object, creates a `collector` object
5. Sets the `reference` of the `collector` to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the collector reference |
