## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) BiologicallyDerivedProduct resources. These templates focus on different aspects of a biologically derived product, such as collection information, processing details, parent relationships, and associated requests.

## What does it do?
These templates are used to transform data into FHIR-compliant JSON structures representing BiologicallyDerivedProduct resources. Each template addresses a specific aspect of the resource:

1. Collection information: 
   - Collector details (collection.collector.hbs)
   - Source information (collection.source.hbs)
2. Parent relationship (parent.hbs)
3. Processing details, specifically additives (processing.additive.hbs)
4. Associated requests (request.hbs)

When used in a FHIR conversion system, these templates help standardize and structure healthcare data related to biologically derived products, making it interoperable and consistent with FHIR specifications.

## Key Files
1. collection.collector.hbs: Generates a BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource with collector information.
2. collection.source.hbs: Creates a resource with collection source details.
3. parent.hbs: Produces a resource with a parent reference.
4. processing.additive.hbs: Generates a resource focusing on processing additives.
5. request.hbs: Creates a resource with an associated request reference.

Each file follows a similar structure:
```handlebars
{
  "resourceType": "BiologicallyDerivedProduct",
  "id": "{{ID}}",
  // Specific properties for each aspect (e.g., collection, processing, etc.)
}
```

The templates use Handlebars syntax to insert provided values (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structures. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to FHIR format.

## Configuration
The templates don't include specific configuration options. They use fixed structures for the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource, with customization primarily through the input variables (ID and REF).

Each template typically accepts two inputs:
1. ID: A string representing the unique identifier for the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource.
2. REF: A string containing a reference to the specific aspect being addressed (e.g., collector, source, parent, etc.).

For example, in the collection.collector.hbs template:
```handlebars
{
  "resourceType": "BiologicallyDerivedProduct",
  "id": "{{ID}}",
  "collection": {
    "collector": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
}
```

It's important to note that these templates generate partial representations of a BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource, each focusing on a specific aspect. They are likely intended to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other data to form a complete FHIR resource.

The generated JSON structures are designed to be FHIR-compliant and can be used as part of FHIR API requests or responses.
