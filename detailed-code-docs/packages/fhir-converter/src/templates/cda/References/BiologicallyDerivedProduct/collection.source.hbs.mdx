### BiologicallyDerivedProduct Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a BiologicallyDerivedProduct FHIR resource, focusing on the collection source information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the source of the collection |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a BiologicallyDerivedProduct FHIR resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a resource object with type "BiologicallyDerivedProduct"
2. Sets the resource ID using the provided `{{ID}}` input
3. Defines a collection object within the resource
4. Sets the collection source reference using the provided `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The template is designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to FHIR format.
- The generated JSON structure is not complete and would typically be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle.
