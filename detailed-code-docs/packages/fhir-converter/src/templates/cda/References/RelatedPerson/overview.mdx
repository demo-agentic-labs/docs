### RelatedPerson Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR RelatedPerson resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reference to a patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the RelatedPerson resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated patient |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR RelatedPerson resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "RelatedPerson",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "patient": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "RelatedPerson".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field.
3. It creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON object suggests that this template might be part of a larger FHIR resource creation process, as it's wrapped in a "resource" object.
3. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests that this might be part of a larger array or object in the full implementation.
