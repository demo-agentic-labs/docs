## High-level description

### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Claim resource with a focus on the `locationReference` within an `item` array.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location associated with the claim item |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR Claim resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Claim"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Claim
  - `item`: An array containing a single object with:
    - `locationReference`: An object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets up the basic structure of a FHIR Claim resource.
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the Claim resource.
3. Within the `item` array, it creates an object with a `locationReference` property.
4. The `locationReference` object contains a `reference` property, which is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be a partial representation of a FHIR Claim resource, focusing specifically on the `locationReference` within an `item`. It's likely meant to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other partial templates to create a complete Claim resource.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
3. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) suggests that this template is designed to be populated with data from a CDA document or another data source during the conversion process.
