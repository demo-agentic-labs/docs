### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Claim resource with an emphasis on the insurer field. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and the insurer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurer |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Claim resource with the insurer field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts with a "resource" object of type "Claim".
2. It sets the "id" field using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. It defines an "insurer" object with a "reference" field, populated by the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, where the `ID` and `REF` values would be provided dynamically.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. Error management would likely be handled by the system using this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather serves as a component in a larger FHIR resource generation system. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` values when the template is rendered.
