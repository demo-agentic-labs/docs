### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource. It includes a `related` array with a single entry containing a reference to another claim.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the related claim |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Claim resource with a related claim |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Claim"
2. Sets the `id` of the Claim resource using the `{{ID}}` input
3. Defines a `related` array with a single object
4. Within the related object, sets a `claim` object with a `reference` property using the `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses two input variables (ID and REF) that should be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the ID and reference to be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
3. The structure follows the FHIR Claim resource specification, specifically focusing on the `related` field to link to another claim.
4. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources, possibly from other healthcare data formats like CDA (Clinical Document Architecture), as suggested by the file path.
