### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a FHIR Claim resource, focusing on the procedure reference. It creates a JSON object with a nested structure for the Claim resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the procedure |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Claim resource with a procedure reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a "resource" object with "resourceType" set to "Claim".
2. Sets the "id" of the Claim resource using the provided `{{ID}}`.
3. Defines a "procedure" array with a single object.
4. Within the procedure object, creates a "procedureReference" object with a "reference" field set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID     | string | The identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF    | string | The reference to the procedure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy modification of the Claim resource structure if needed.
3. The current implementation only includes a single procedure reference, but the array structure allows for easy expansion to multiple procedures if required in the future.
