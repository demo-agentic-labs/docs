### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Claim resource with an `originalPrescription` field. The `originalPrescription` is a reference to another resource, likely representing the original prescription associated with this claim.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the original prescription resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Claim resource with the `originalPrescription` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "Claim".
3. It sets the `id` of the Claim using the `{{ID}}` input.
4. It creates an `originalPrescription` object with a `reference` property, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a FHIR converter, likely used to transform CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The file includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template creates only a partial Claim resource. In a complete FHIR Claim, there would typically be additional fields.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where Handlebars will insert dynamic values when the template is rendered.
