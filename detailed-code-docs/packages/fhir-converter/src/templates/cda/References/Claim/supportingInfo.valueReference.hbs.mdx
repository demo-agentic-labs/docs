### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This Handlebars template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource. It specifically populates the `supportingInfo` array with a single item containing a `valueReference` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to another resource that provides supporting information |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR Claim resource with the following key elements:
- `resourceType`: Set to "Claim"
- `id`: Set to the provided `ID` value
- `supportingInfo`: An array containing a single object with a `valueReference` field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Claim".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the Claim resource.
4. It creates a `supportingInfo` array with a single object.
5. Within this object, it sets a `valueReference` object with a `reference` field using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided and valid.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
- The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Claim resource, focusing specifically on the `supportingInfo` field. It may be intended to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other partial templates to create a complete Claim resource.
- The structure follows the FHIR specification for the Claim resource, particularly in how it represents supporting information with references to other resources.
