### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Claim resource with a `careTeam` array containing a single provider reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the provider in the careTeam |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Claim resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: Object
  - `resourceType`: "Claim"
  - `id`: String (from input `ID`)
  - `careTeam`: Array
    - Single object with `provider` property
      - `provider`: Object
        - `reference`: String (from input `REF`)

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Claim".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` of the Claim resource.
4. It creates a `careTeam` array with a single object.
5. Within the `careTeam` object, it sets a `provider` object with a `reference` property using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The structure provided is a partial Claim resource. In a complete FHIR Claim, there would typically be additional properties and potentially multiple `careTeam` entries.
4. The template uses minimal Handlebars syntax, primarily for variable substitution ({{ID}} and {{REF}}). It doesn't include any complex logic or control structures.
5. This template focuses solely on the `careTeam` and `provider` elements of a Claim resource, suggesting it's meant to be combined with other templates to form a complete Claim resource.
