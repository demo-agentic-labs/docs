### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource, specifically defining the `facility` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the facility associated with the claim |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Claim resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Claim".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. It creates a `facility` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, where the `ID` and `REF` values would be provided dynamically.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly by the calling context.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically tailored for the `facility` field of a Claim resource, suggesting it's part of a larger set of templates for creating complete FHIR resources.
3. The structure is partial, indicating it might be combined with other templates or data to form a complete Claim resource.
