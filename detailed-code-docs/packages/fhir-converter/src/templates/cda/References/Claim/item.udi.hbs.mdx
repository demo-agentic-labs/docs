### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource. It specifically populates the `item.udi` field with a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the UDI |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Claim resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the Claim resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Claim"
  - `id`: The identifier of the Claim
  - `item`: An array containing a single item object
    - `udi`: An array containing a single UDI object
      - `reference`: The reference value for the UDI

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets up the basic structure of a FHIR Claim resource.
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the Claim resource.
3. Within the `item` array, it creates a single item object.
4. Inside the item object, it creates a `udi` array with a single object.
5. The `reference` field of the UDI object is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `id` and UDI reference to be dynamically set when the template is rendered.
3. This template focuses solely on the `item.udi` field of a Claim resource. In a real-world scenario, a Claim resource would typically include additional fields and potentially multiple items.
4. The JSON structure uses trailing commas, which is not standard JSON but is often accepted by modern parsers and can make version control diffs cleaner.
