## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR Claim resource structure, specifically focusing on the referral field. It's designed to be used in a larger context for generating FHIR-compliant JSON representations of claims with referral information.

### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource, specifically including the `referral` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the referral |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A partial FHIR Claim resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Claim".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the Claim resource.
4. It creates a `referral` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. This template appears to be a partial representation of a Claim resource, focusing only on the `id` and `referral` fields. It's likely used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete Claim resource.
4. The JSON structure is not complete (it has trailing commas and is wrapped in extra braces), suggesting it's meant to be combined with other partial templates to form a complete FHIR resource.
