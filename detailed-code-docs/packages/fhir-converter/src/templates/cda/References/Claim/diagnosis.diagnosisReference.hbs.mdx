### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource, specifically focusing on the diagnosis reference part of the claim.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the diagnosis resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Claim resource with a diagnosis reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Claim".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the Claim resource's id.
4. It includes a `diagnosis` array with a single element.
5. Within the diagnosis element, it sets a `diagnosisReference` object with a `reference` field.
6. The `reference` field uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the actual reference value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Claim resource, focusing only on the diagnosis reference. It may be intended to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other data to form a complete Claim resource.
3. The JSON structure uses trailing commas, which is not standard JSON but is often accepted by modern parsers and may be intended for easier maintenance and merging of templates.
