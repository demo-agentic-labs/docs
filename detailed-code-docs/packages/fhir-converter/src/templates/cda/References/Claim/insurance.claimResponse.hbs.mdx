### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource. It specifically populates the `insurance` array with a single entry containing a `claimResponse` reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated ClaimResponse resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Claim resource with insurance claim response information |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "Claim" and assigns the provided `ID`.
3. It then creates an `insurance` array with a single object.
4. Within this object, it sets a `claimResponse` property with a `reference` to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of the Metriport Inc. project and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Claim resource, focusing specifically on the insurance claim response reference. It may be used as part of a larger template or combined with other data to create a complete Claim resource.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for the Claim resource, particularly the `insurance` and `claimResponse` elements.
