## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR Claim resources. These templates are designed to be used in a larger FHIR conversion system, likely for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect or field of a FHIR Claim resource.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create various parts of a FHIR Claim resource. They allow for flexible generation of different Claim components, such as:

1. Accident location references
2. Care team provider references
3. Diagnosis references
4. Enterer information
5. Facility references
6. Insurance coverage and claim response references
7. Insurer references
8. Item details (encounters, locations, UDIs)
9. Original prescription references
10. Patient references
11. Payee party references
12. Prescription references
13. Procedure references (including UDIs)
14. Provider references
15. Referral information
16. Related claim references
17. Supporting information references

Each template generates a JSON structure for a specific part of a Claim resource, using Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values. These partial structures can be combined to create complete FHIR Claim resources as needed.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory would likely be a higher-level template or script that combines these individual templates to create a complete FHIR Claim resource. Each template in this directory serves as a modular component that can be used as needed when constructing a Claim.

## Key Files
All files in this directory are important, as each represents a different aspect of a FHIR Claim resource. Some key files include:

1. `accident.locationReference.hbs`: Defines the accident location reference.
2. `careTeam.provider.hbs`: Specifies the care team provider reference.
3. `diagnosis.diagnosisReference.hbs`: Creates the diagnosis reference structure.
4. `insurance.coverage.hbs` and `insurance.claimResponse.hbs`: Handle insurance-related information.
5. `item.encounter.hbs`, `item.locationReference.hbs`, and `item.udi.hbs`: Define various item-related structures.
6. `procedure.procedureReference.hbs` and `procedure.udi.hbs`: Create procedure-related structures.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely dependent on other components for providing the necessary context and data for rendering.

## Configuration
Each template uses Handlebars placeholders (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to allow for dynamic insertion of values when rendered. The specific configuration for each template varies, but generally includes:

- `ID`: The unique identifier for the Claim resource or sub-component.
- `REF`: A reference to another resource or value specific to the template's purpose.

These templates are designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for easy integration into a larger FHIR resource generation process. The actual configuration and use of these templates would be determined by the higher-level system that incorporates them.
