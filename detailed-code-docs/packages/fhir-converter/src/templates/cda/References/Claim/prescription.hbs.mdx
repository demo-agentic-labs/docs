### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Claim resource with a prescription reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated prescription |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Claim resource with a prescription reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to inject dynamic values into the JSON.
3. The `resourceType` is set to "Claim".
4. The `id` field is populated with the provided `ID` value.
5. The `prescription` field contains a nested object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final JSON output.

## Configuration
This template doesn't define any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for `ID` and `REF`.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that valid values will be provided for `ID` and `REF`. If these values are not provided or are invalid, it may result in an incomplete or invalid JSON structure.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The generated JSON structure is not complete and would typically be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle.
3. The trailing commas in the JSON structure might need to be removed depending on how this template is used, as they are not valid in standard JSON.
