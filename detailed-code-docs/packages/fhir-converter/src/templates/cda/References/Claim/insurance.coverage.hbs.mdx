### Claim Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Claim resource with an emphasis on the insurance coverage reference. It sets up the basic structure of a Claim resource and includes an insurance array with a single coverage reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Claim resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the coverage resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Claim resource with the following structure:
- A resource object with:
  - resourceType: "Claim"
  - id: The provided ID
  - insurance: An array containing a single object with:
    - coverage: An object with a reference to the provided REF

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Claim resource.
2. It sets the resourceType to "Claim".
3. It assigns the provided ID to the id field.
4. It creates an insurance array with a single object.
5. Within the insurance object, it creates a coverage object with a reference field.
6. The reference field is set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used for generating HTML and, in this case, JSON structures.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The template relies on the input variables (ID and REF) to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. This template represents only a partial Claim resource. In a complete FHIR Claim resource, there would typically be additional fields and potentially multiple insurance entries.
4. The template uses double curly braces ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to indicate where variable substitution should occur when the template is rendered.
