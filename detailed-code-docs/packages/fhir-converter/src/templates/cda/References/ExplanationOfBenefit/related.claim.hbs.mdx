### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a "related" array with a single entry containing a claim reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the related claim |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the ExplanationOfBenefit details
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "ExplanationOfBenefit"
  - `id`: The provided ID
  - `related`: An array with one object
    - `claim`: An object with a `reference` field set to the provided REF value

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. It creates a `related` array with a single object.
4. Within the `related` object, it sets up a `claim` object with a `reference` field using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, as indicated by the `.hbs` file extension and the use of Handlebars syntax (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`).

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically tailored for the "related claim" part of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, suggesting it might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete ExplanationOfBenefit resource.
3. The structure follows the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for representing healthcare data.
