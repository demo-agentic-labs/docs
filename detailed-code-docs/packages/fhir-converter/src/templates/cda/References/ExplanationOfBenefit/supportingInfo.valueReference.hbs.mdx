## High-level description
This Handlebars template generates a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) ExplanationOfBenefit resource with a supportingInfo section containing a valueReference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, which is part of the FHIR standard. It includes a supportingInfo array with a single item containing a valueReference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the supportingInfo's valueReference |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing an ExplanationOfBenefit resource with supportingInfo |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an outer object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "supportingInfo" array with a single object.
5. Within the supportingInfo object, creates a "valueReference" object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
- The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of different ID and REF values when rendered.
- This template represents only a part of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource. In a complete FHIR resource, there would likely be additional properties and potentially more items in the supportingInfo array.
