### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing on the `payee.party` element. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the party reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the party associated with the payee |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following elements:
- `resourceType`: Set to "ExplanationOfBenefit"
- `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
- `payee.party.reference`: A reference to the party associated with the payee

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to insert the resource's unique identifier.
2. It creates a `payee` object with a nested `party` object.
3. Within the `party` object, it sets the `reference` field using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, which processes the `{{}}` syntax to insert dynamic values.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is used.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this template expects two inputs to be provided when rendered:

| Input | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| ID    | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF   | The reference to the party associated with the payee |

Note: This template is a partial representation and would typically be used as part of a larger template or system for generating complete FHIR resources.
