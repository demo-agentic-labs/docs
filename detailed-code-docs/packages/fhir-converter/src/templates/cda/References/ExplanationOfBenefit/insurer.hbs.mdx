### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, specifically defining the 'insurer' field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the insurer |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "insurer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's unique identifier.
3. The `insurer` field is populated with a `reference` object, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the actual reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, as indicated by the `.hbs` file extension and the use of Handlebars syntax (`{{...}}`).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the input variables `ID` and `REF` to be provided when the template is rendered.
