### ExplanationOfBenefit Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing on the provider field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the provider associated with this ExplanationOfBenefit |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ExplanationOfBenefit"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `provider`: An object with a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. The `provider` field is populated with an object containing a `reference` field, which is set to the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided and valid when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing only on the `id` and `provider` fields. It may be intended to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other partial templates to create a complete ExplanationOfBenefit resource.
3. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which might need to be handled or removed depending on how this template is used in the larger context of the application.
