### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource in FHIR format. It specifically includes the `originalPrescription` field, which is a reference to the original prescription related to this explanation of benefit.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the original prescription |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following fields:
- `resourceType`: Always set to "ExplanationOfBenefit"
- `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
- `originalPrescription`: A reference object containing the reference to the original prescription

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders in the template will be replaced with the actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion system.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it's designed to be used as part of a system that converts CDA data to FHIR format. The resulting JSON structure conforms to the FHIR specification for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource, specifically the `originalPrescription` field.
