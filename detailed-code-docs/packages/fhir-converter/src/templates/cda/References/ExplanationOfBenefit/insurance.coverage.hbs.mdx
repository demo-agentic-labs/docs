### ExplanationOfBenefit Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing on the insurance coverage reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the coverage resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the insurance coverage reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ExplanationOfBenefit resource structure.
2. Sets the resourceType to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the resource.
4. Creates an insurance array with a single object.
5. Within the insurance object, creates a coverage object with a reference field.
6. Assigns the provided REF value to the coverage reference.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, as indicated by the use of Handlebars syntax (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3.
2. The structure provided is a partial representation of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing only on the insurance coverage reference. It may be part of a larger template or system for generating complete FHIR resources.
3. The template uses a nested structure to represent the FHIR resource, which is consistent with the FHIR JSON format.
4. The insurance array contains only one element, suggesting this template is designed for scenarios where only one insurance coverage is being referenced.
