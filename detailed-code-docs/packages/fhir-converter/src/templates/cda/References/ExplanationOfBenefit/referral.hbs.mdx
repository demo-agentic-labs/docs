### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit FHIR resource. It specifically defines the `referral` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the referral |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit FHIR resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "referral": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's `id` field.
3. The `referral` field is populated with a `reference` subfield, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `ID` and `REF` values to be dynamically inserted during the conversion process.
4. This template represents only a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing solely on the `referral` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates to create a complete FHIR resource.
