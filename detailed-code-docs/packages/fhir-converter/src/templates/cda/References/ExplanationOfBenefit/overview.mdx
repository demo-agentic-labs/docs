## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource in FHIR format. These templates are designed to be used in a FHIR converter system, likely for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different sections of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, which is used in healthcare to provide detailed information about a claim for health insurance benefits. Each template focuses on a specific part of the ExplanationOfBenefit resource, such as the patient reference, provider information, claim details, and supporting information. When combined, these templates can generate a complete ExplanationOfBenefit resource that follows the FHIR standard.

## Key Files
1. `patient.hbs`: Generates the patient reference section of the ExplanationOfBenefit resource.
2. `provider.hbs`: Creates the provider information section.
3. `claim.hbs`: Produces the claim reference section.
4. `insurer.hbs`: Generates the insurer reference section.
5. `facility.hbs`: Creates the facility reference section.
6. `procedure.procedureReference.hbs`: Produces the procedure reference section.
7. `supportingInfo.valueReference.hbs`: Generates the supporting information section with value references.
8. `item.encounter.hbs`: Creates the item encounter reference section.
9. `diagnosis.diagnosisReference.hbs`: Produces the diagnosis reference section.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:
- They define a partial JSON structure for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource.
- They use Handlebars syntax (`{{}}`) for dynamic value insertion.
- They typically require an `ID` input for the resource identifier and a `REF` input for the specific reference value.

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine. They are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely depending on other components for processing and combining the generated partial structures into complete FHIR resources.

## Configuration
While individual templates don't have specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of input variables (typically `ID` and `REF`). The overall configuration of how these templates are used and combined would be managed by the broader FHIR converter system.

## Notes
1. Each template file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are part of a project by Metriport Inc. and incorporate work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The templates are designed to be modular, each focusing on a specific part of the ExplanationOfBenefit resource. This modular approach allows for flexibility in generating different parts of the resource as needed.
3. The generated structures follow the FHIR standard for representing healthcare data, ensuring interoperability with other FHIR-compliant systems.
4. While these templates provide the structure for various parts of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, the actual data population and combination of these parts into a complete resource would be handled by the broader FHIR converter system.
5. Error handling and validation of input data are not implemented within these templates. Such concerns would need to be addressed by the system using these templates.
