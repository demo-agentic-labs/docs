### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, which is a FHIR resource type used to provide explanation of benefit (EOB) information from a healthcare claim.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated claim |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "claim": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field.
3. It creates a `claim` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for generating FHIR-compliant JSON data. The generated JSON can be used as part of a larger FHIR API implementation.
