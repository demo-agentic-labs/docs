### ExplanationOfBenefit Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, specifically populating the `addItem.provider` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the provider associated with the addItem |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource in JSON format |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ExplanationOfBenefit resource structure.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates an `addItem` array with a single object.
5. Within the `addItem` object, creates a `provider` array with a single object.
6. Sets the `reference` field of the provider object to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing only on the `addItem.provider` field. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete ExplanationOfBenefit resource.
3. The structure of the JSON output suggests that this template is designed to be part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource, as it's wrapped in a `resource` object.
