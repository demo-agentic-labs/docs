### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource in FHIR format. It specifically populates the `accident.locationReference` field with a provided reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location of the accident |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "accident": {
            "locationReference": {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field of the resource.
3. Within the `accident` object, it creates a `locationReference` object.
4. The `reference` field of `locationReference` is set to the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in web applications and for generating dynamic content.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The template relies on the input variables `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input variables (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) will be provided and valid when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the FHIR ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing on the accident location reference.
3. This template appears to be a partial representation of the ExplanationOfBenefit resource, likely to be used in conjunction with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where dynamic content should be inserted when the template is rendered.
