### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing on the 'facility' field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the facility resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "facility": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's id.
3. The `facility` field is set with a nested `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided when the template is rendered.
