### ExplanationOfBenefit Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource with a focus on the diagnosis reference. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a diagnosis array with a single diagnosis reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the diagnosis resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing an ExplanationOfBenefit resource with a diagnosis reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "ExplanationOfBenefit"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "diagnosis" array with a single object
5. Within the diagnosis object, creates a "diagnosisReference" object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options. The structure is fixed, and the only customizable parts are the ID and REF values passed as inputs.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.
