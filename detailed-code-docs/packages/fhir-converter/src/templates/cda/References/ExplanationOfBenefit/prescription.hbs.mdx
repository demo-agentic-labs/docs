### ExplanationOfBenefit Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, including the resourceType, id, and prescription reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the prescription associated with this ExplanationOfBenefit |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "prescription": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's id.
3. It creates a `prescription` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the reference value.
