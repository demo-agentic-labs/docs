### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an item array with an encounter reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the FHIR resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ExplanationOfBenefit"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `item`: An array containing a single item
    - `encounter`: An array with a single encounter reference

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the resource's `id`.
3. Within the `item` array, it creates an `encounter` array with a single object.
4. The encounter object contains a `reference` field, which is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be a partial representation of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing specifically on the `item.encounter` field.
2. The structure suggests that this template might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete ExplanationOfBenefit resource.
