### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing on the 'enterer' field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the person who entered the information |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "enterer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `enterer` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).
