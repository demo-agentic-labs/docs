title: "addItem.locationReference.hbs"

## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) ExplanationOfBenefit resource structure. It specifically focuses on the `addItem.locationReference` field, which is used to reference a location associated with an additional item in an explanation of benefits.

### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource in FHIR format. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an `addItem` array with a `locationReference` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the associated location |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ExplanationOfBenefit"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `addItem`: An array containing additional items
    - `locationReference`: An object with a `reference` field pointing to the associated location

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the resource's `id`.
3. In the `addItem` array, it creates an object with a `locationReference` field.
4. The `locationReference` object contains a `reference` field, which is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, as indicated by the use of `{{}}` syntax for variable interpolation.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing specifically on the `addItem.locationReference` field. It may be intended to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource, particularly the `addItem` and `locationReference` fields.
4. The template uses a nested structure to clearly represent the JSON hierarchy of the FHIR resource.
