### ExplanationOfBenefit Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, which is part of the FHIR standard. It specifically includes the `claimResponse` field, which is a reference to a ClaimResponse resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the ExplanationOfBenefit resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the associated ClaimResponse resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial ExplanationOfBenefit resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "claimResponse": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "ExplanationOfBenefit".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's id.
3. It creates a `claimResponse` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of Metriport Inc.'s codebase.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions and disclaimers.
3. This template appears to be a partial representation of an ExplanationOfBenefit resource, focusing only on the `claimResponse` field. In a complete FHIR ExplanationOfBenefit resource, there would typically be many more fields.
4. The template is designed to be flexible, using placeholders for `ID` and `REF`, which would be filled in during the conversion process.
