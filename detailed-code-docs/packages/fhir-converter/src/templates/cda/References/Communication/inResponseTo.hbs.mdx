### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Communication resource. It specifically focuses on setting the `inResponseTo` field, which indicates that this communication is a response to another referenced resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for this Communication resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the resource that this communication is responding to |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Communication resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Communication",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "inResponseTo": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}",
            },
        ],
    },
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Communication".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
3. The `inResponseTo` field is an array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder to set the reference to the resource being responded to.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the ID and REF placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON suggests that this might be part of a larger FHIR bundle or a wrapper object, as the actual Communication resource is nested under a "resource" key.
3. The `inResponseTo` field is an array, suggesting that a Communication could potentially be in response to multiple resources, although this template only includes one.
4. The trailing commas in the JSON structure might cause issues with strict JSON parsers and may need to be removed in production use.
