### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Communication resource with a `partOf` field, which indicates that this communication is part of another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this Communication resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource that this communication is part of |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Communication resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Communication",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "partOf": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Communication".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field.
3. It creates a `partOf` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this template expects two inputs to be provided when rendered:

| Input | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| ID    | The unique identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF   | The reference to the resource that this communication is part of |
