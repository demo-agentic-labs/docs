### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Communication resource with a focus on the recipient field. It sets up the basic structure of the resource including the resourceType, id, and a single recipient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the recipient of the communication |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Communication resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resourceType to "Communication"
2. Assigns the provided ID to the resource's id field
3. Creates a recipient array with a single object containing a reference field
4. The reference field is populated with the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Communication resource. In a complete FHIR resource, there would likely be additional fields and potentially multiple recipients.
3. The use of double curly braces ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates where dynamic values should be inserted when the template is rendered.
4. The structure of the JSON suggests that this template might be used as part of a larger template or transformation process, as it's wrapped in additional curly braces that aren't closed within this file.
