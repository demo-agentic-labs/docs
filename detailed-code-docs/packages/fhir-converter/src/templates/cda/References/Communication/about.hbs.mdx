### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Communication resource. It specifically populates the "about" field with a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF  | String | The reference value for the "about" field |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Communication resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside "resource", it sets:
   - "resourceType" to "Communication"
   - "id" to the provided `{{ID}}`
   - "about" as an array with a single object containing a "reference" field set to `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template is configured to generate a specific structure for a FHIR Communication resource. The structure is fixed, with only the "id" and "about.reference" fields being dynamic.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## TODOs
The template includes a comprehensive copyright and permission notice at the beginning, which covers both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation. This notice should be retained in any use or modification of the file.
