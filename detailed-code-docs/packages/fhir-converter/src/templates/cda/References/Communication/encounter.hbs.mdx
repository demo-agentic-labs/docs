### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Communication resource with an embedded encounter reference. The Communication resource is used to record and request information about the conveyance of information between participants.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Communication resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Communication",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "encounter": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Communication".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field of the Communication resource.
3. It creates an `encounter` object within the resource, setting its `reference` to the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the input variables provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the incorporated Microsoft work is provided under a more permissive license.
3. This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format, specifically handling the creation of Communication resources with associated encounters.
4. The template uses minimal formatting and doesn't include any conditional logic, suggesting it's designed for straightforward, one-to-one mapping of encounter references to Communication resources.
