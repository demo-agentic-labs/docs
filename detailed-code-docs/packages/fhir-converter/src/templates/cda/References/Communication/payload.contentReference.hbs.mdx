## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Communication resource with a payload containing a content reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Communication resource with a specific structure, including an ID and a payload with a content reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the content reference in the payload |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Communication resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "Communication".
3. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the "id" field.
4. In the "payload" array, it creates an object with a "contentReference" property.
5. The "contentReference" contains a "reference" field, which is set to the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR specification | Defines the structure and requirements for the Communication resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The structure is fixed, with placeholders for dynamic values (ID and REF).

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions and disclaimers.
3. The template uses Handlebars syntax (`{{}}`) for inserting dynamic values.
4. The resulting JSON structure is nested, with the Communication resource being a property of an outer object. This suggests it might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or a specific wrapper structure used by the converter.
