## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Communication resource structure, specifically focusing on the `basedOn` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Communication resource with a `basedOn` field. The `basedOn` field is used to reference other resources that this communication is based on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource this communication is based on |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Communication resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Communication"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `basedOn`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Communication".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field.
3. In the `basedOn` array, it creates an object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The `basedOn` array in this template only includes a single reference. In a full FHIR Communication resource, this array could potentially contain multiple references.
3. This template appears to be a partial representation of a Communication resource, likely to be combined with other templates to form a complete FHIR resource.
