## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR Communication resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or aspect of the Communication resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR Communication resource. A Communication resource in FHIR is used to record and request information about the conveyance of information between participants in a healthcare context. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various components of this resource, such as:

1. Setting the subject of the communication
2. Specifying the sender and recipient
3. Indicating what the communication is about
4. Referencing the encounter associated with the communication
5. Specifying the reason for the communication
6. Indicating if the communication is in response to another communication
7. Specifying the payload content reference
8. Indicating if the communication is part of another resource

Each template generates a JSON structure that represents a part of the Communication resource. These parts can be combined to form a complete FHIR Communication resource during the conversion process from CDA to FHIR.

## Key Files
1. `about.hbs`: Creates the "about" field of the Communication resource, referencing what the communication is about.
2. `basedOn.hbs`: Generates the "basedOn" field, indicating other resources this communication is based on.
3. `encounter.hbs`: Sets the "encounter" field, linking the communication to a specific healthcare encounter.
4. `inResponseTo.hbs`: Creates the "inResponseTo" field, showing that this communication is a response to another referenced resource.
5. `partOf.hbs`: Generates the "partOf" field, indicating that this communication is part of another resource.
6. `payload.contentReference.hbs`: Creates the "payload" field with a content reference.
7. `reasonReference.hbs`: Sets the "reasonReference" field, providing a reason for the communication.
8. `recipient.hbs`: Creates the "recipient" field, specifying who receives the communication.
9. `sender.hbs`: Sets the "sender" field, indicating who sent the communication.
10. `subject.hbs`: Creates the "subject" field, specifying what the communication is about.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a partial JSON object that represents a specific part of the Communication resource. They all use Handlebars syntax for variable substitution, typically expecting an `ID` for the resource and a `REF` for the reference value specific to each field.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR converter system, which would provide the necessary context and data for rendering each template.

The templates adhere to the FHIR specification for the Communication resource, ensuring that the generated JSON structures are compliant with FHIR standards.

## Configuration
These templates don't include specific configuration options. Instead, they are designed to be flexible parts of a larger system. The behavior of each template is determined by the input values (typically `ID` and `REF`) provided when the template is rendered.
