### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Communication resource with a subject reference. The Communication resource is used to record and request information about the conveyance of information between participants.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the communication |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR Communication resource with the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resource | Object | The FHIR Communication resource |
| resource.resourceType | String | Always set to "Communication" |
| resource.id | String | The unique identifier for the resource |
| resource.subject | Object | The subject of the communication |
| resource.subject.reference | String | A reference to the subject |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "Communication".
3. It sets the "id" of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` variable.
4. It creates a "subject" object with a "reference" property, set to the provided `{{REF}}` variable.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the variables ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input variables provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't include explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF variables will be provided and valid when the template is used.
