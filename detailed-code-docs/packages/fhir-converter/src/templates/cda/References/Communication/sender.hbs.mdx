### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Communication resource structure with a sender field. It's designed to be integrated into a larger FHIR resource compilation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the sender of the communication |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Communication resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Communication",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "sender": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Communication".
2. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. It creates a `sender` object within the resource, with a `reference` field set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger templating system where `ID` and `REF` values are provided during the conversion process.

## Error Handling
The template doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly by the calling context.
