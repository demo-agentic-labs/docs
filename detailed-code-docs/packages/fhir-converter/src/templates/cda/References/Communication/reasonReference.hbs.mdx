### Communication Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Communication resource with a reasonReference field. The Communication resource is used to record and request information about the conveyance of information between participants.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Communication resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the reason for the communication |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Communication resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Communication",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "reasonReference": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}",
            },
        ],
    },
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Communication".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` of the resource.
3. The `reasonReference` field is an array with a single object containing a `reference` field, which is set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |
| FHIR specification | Defines the structure and content of the Communication resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it generates a part of a FHIR API response. The generated Communication resource adheres to the FHIR specification for the Communication resource type.
