## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR Coverage resources, specifically focusing on the beneficiary and payor fields. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter project, designed to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory create JSON structures representing FHIR Coverage resources. They handle two specific aspects of a Coverage resource:

1. The beneficiary (the person or patient who is covered)
2. The payor (the organization responsible for paying for the coverage)

These templates allow for flexible representation of these entities, including scenarios where the information might be unknown or uncertain. They generate standardized FHIR-compliant JSON structures that can be used in healthcare data exchange and interoperability scenarios.

## Key Files

1. `beneficiary.hbs`: This template generates a Coverage resource focusing on the beneficiary field. It creates a JSON structure that includes:
   - A unique identifier for the Coverage resource
   - A beneficiary reference
   - An optional "unknown" display value for cases where the beneficiary information is uncertain

2. `payor.hbs`: This template creates a Coverage resource emphasizing the payor information. It produces a JSON structure containing:
   - A unique identifier for the Coverage resource
   - A payor reference within an array
   - An optional "unknown" display value for situations where the payor information is uncertain

Both templates use a similar structure and logic, adapting to the specific needs of representing beneficiaries and payors in a FHIR Coverage resource.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing conditional statements and variable interpolation. They are designed to work within the larger context of the FHIR converter project, which likely provides the necessary runtime environment and data inputs.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have explicit configuration options, they do use a `canBeUnknown` flag to determine whether to include an "unknown" display value. This flag allows for flexibility in representing uncertain or missing information in the generated FHIR resources.

The templates expect the following inputs:
- `ID`: A unique identifier for the Coverage resource
- `REF`: A reference to either the beneficiary or payor, depending on the template
- `canBeUnknown`: A boolean flag indicating whether the entity (beneficiary or payor) can be marked as unknown

These inputs would typically be provided by the larger FHIR converter system when rendering the templates.

Example usage of the `beneficiary.hbs` template:

```handlebars
{{&gt; References/Coverage/beneficiary.hbs ID="coverage-123" REF="Patient/patient-456" canBeUnknown=true}}
```

This would generate a JSON structure like:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Coverage",
    "id": "coverage-123",
    "beneficiary": {
      "display": "unknown",
      "reference": "Patient/patient-456"
    }
  }
}
```

The templates are designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for consistent generation of FHIR Coverage resources across different parts of the CDA to FHIR conversion process.
