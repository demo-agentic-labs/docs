### Coverage Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Coverage resource, specifically populating the beneficiary field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Coverage resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the beneficiary |
| canBeUnknown | Boolean | Flag to indicate if the beneficiary can be unknown |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Coverage resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining a Coverage resource with the provided ID.
2. It then sets the beneficiary field:
   - If `canBeUnknown` is true, it adds a "display" field with the value "unknown".
   - It always includes a "reference" field with the value of `REF`.

## Side Effects
This template does not have any side effects as it's purely for generating a JSON structure based on the input variables.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the conditional statements and variable interpolation.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the necessary variables (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax, as evidenced by the use of `{{}}` for variable interpolation and `{{#if}}` for conditional rendering.
3. The `canBeUnknown` flag allows for flexibility in how the beneficiary is represented, potentially useful in scenarios where the beneficiary information is not available or uncertain.
