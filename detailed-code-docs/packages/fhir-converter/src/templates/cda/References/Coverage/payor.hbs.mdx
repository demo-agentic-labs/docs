### Coverage Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Coverage resource, specifically focusing on the payor information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Coverage resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the payor |
| canBeUnknown | Boolean | Flag to determine if the payor can be marked as unknown |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Coverage resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "Coverage" and assigns the provided "ID".
3. It then creates a "payor" array with a single object:
   - If `canBeUnknown` is true, it includes a "display" field with the value "unknown".
   - It always includes a "reference" field with the value from the "REF" input.

## Side Effects
This template does not have any side effects as it only generates a JSON structure based on the provided inputs.

## Dependencies
This template uses Handlebars.js for dynamic content generation.

## Configuration
The template uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| canBeUnknown | Boolean | undefined | Determines if the payor can be marked as unknown |

## Error Handling
This template does not implement specific error handling. It relies on Handlebars.js to handle any template rendering errors.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as mentioned in the header comments.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for the payor to be marked as unknown if necessary.
4. The structure follows the FHIR Coverage resource format, focusing specifically on the payor information.
