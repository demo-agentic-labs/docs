### GuidanceResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reference to output parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the output parameters |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON representation of a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "GuidanceResponse"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `outputParameters` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
3. The output is a partial JSON structure, suggesting it might be used as part of a larger JSON document or array.
