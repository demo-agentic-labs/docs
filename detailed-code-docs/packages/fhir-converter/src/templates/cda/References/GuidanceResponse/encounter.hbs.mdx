### GuidanceResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource with an encounter reference. The template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the encounter reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "GuidanceResponse"
- id: The provided ID
- encounter: An object containing a reference to the associated encounter

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to insert the provided values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger conversion process where the ID and REF values are provided dynamically.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the system using this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but is likely used as part of a larger FHIR conversion API or system.
