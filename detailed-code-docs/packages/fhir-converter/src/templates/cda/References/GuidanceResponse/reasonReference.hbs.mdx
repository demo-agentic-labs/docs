### GuidanceResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reasonReference array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "GuidanceResponse",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "reasonReference": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "GuidanceResponse".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. It creates a `reasonReference` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, populated with the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF inputs will be provided and valid.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The `reasonReference` field is an array, but this template only includes a single reference. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified.
3. The JSON structure includes extra commas at the end of some lines, which might need to be removed depending on the JSON parser being used.
