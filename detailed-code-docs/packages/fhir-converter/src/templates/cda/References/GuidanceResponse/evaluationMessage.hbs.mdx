## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource structure with an evaluationMessage field. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### GuidanceResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource. It includes an `id` field and an `evaluationMessage` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the evaluationMessage |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "GuidanceResponse",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "evaluationMessage": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "GuidanceResponse".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's `id`.
3. It creates an `evaluationMessage` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the values passed for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the system using this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but is likely used as part of a larger FHIR conversion system. The expected interface is:

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the evaluationMessage |

The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource.
