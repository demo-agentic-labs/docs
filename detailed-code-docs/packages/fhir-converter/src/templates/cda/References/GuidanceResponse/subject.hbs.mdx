### GuidanceResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource with a subject reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the GuidanceResponse |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "GuidanceResponse",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and subject reference.
3. The `resourceType` is set to "GuidanceResponse", which is a fixed value for this type of FHIR resource.
4. The `subject` field is populated with a reference object, containing a single `reference` property.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of |
