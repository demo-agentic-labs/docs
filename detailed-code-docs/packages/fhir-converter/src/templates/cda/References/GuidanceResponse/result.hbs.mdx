### GuidanceResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a result field with a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the result resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR GuidanceResponse resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "GuidanceResponse",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "result": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "GuidanceResponse".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's id.
3. The `result` field is populated with a `reference` object, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the reference value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It's assumed that the calling code will provide valid values for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from multiple parties (Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation).
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of different IDs and reference values.
3. This template focuses solely on the `result` field of a GuidanceResponse. Other fields that might be part of a complete GuidanceResponse resource are not included in this template.
