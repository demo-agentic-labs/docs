### GuidanceResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR GuidanceResponse resource with a focus on the `performer` field. It sets up the basic structure of the resource and includes placeholders for the resource ID and the performer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer of the guidance response |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR GuidanceResponse resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the `resource` object with the `resourceType` set to "GuidanceResponse".
2. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `performer` field is defined as an object with a `reference` property, which is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the GuidanceResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer |

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
- The template is designed to be a partial representation of a GuidanceResponse resource, focusing only on the `performer` field. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
- The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
