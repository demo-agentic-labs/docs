## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a pointer reference. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a MolecularSequence resource with minimal information, specifically an ID and a pointer reference.

### MolecularSequence Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MolecularSequence resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a pointer array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the MolecularSequence resource |
| REF | string | The reference value for the pointer |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR MolecularSequence resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "MolecularSequence"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `pointer` array with a single object containing a `reference` field
4. Populates the `reference` field with the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the MolecularSequence resource.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template generates a minimal MolecularSequence resource structure, focusing only on the ID and pointer reference. It may need to be expanded to include additional fields for a complete MolecularSequence representation according to the FHIR specification.
3. The generated JSON structure is not a complete valid JSON object on its own, as it's wrapped in additional curly braces. This suggests it might be intended to be part of a larger JSON structure or array.
