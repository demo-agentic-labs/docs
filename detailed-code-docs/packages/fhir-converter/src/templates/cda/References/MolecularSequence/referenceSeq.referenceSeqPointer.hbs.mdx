## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a reference sequence pointer. It's designed to generate a JSON structure representing a molecular sequence with a reference to another sequence.

### MolecularSequence Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MolecularSequence resource, focusing on the referenceSeq and referenceSeqPointer elements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the MolecularSequence resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to another sequence |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with the following structure:
- resource
  - resourceType: "MolecularSequence"
  - id: (from input)
  - referenceSeq
    - referenceSeqPointer
      - reference: (from input)

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resourceType to "MolecularSequence"
2. Assigns the provided ID to the resource's id field
3. Creates a referenceSeq object with a nested referenceSeqPointer
4. Sets the reference within referenceSeqPointer to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF variables will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for handling molecular sequence data in the context of Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) to FHIR conversion.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and might be intended to be part of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the trailing commas.
