## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR MolecularSequence resources with various references and pointers. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory create JSON structures representing different aspects of a FHIR MolecularSequence resource. Each template focuses on a specific reference or pointer within the MolecularSequence resource, such as device, patient, performer, specimen, and variant pointers. These templates allow for the dynamic generation of FHIR-compliant JSON objects by injecting values into predefined structures using Handlebars syntax.

## Key Files
1. `device.hbs`: Creates a MolecularSequence resource with a device reference.
2. `patient.hbs`: Generates a MolecularSequence resource with a patient reference.
3. `performer.hbs`: Produces a MolecularSequence resource with a performer reference.
4. `pointer.hbs`: Creates a MolecularSequence resource with a general pointer reference.
5. `referenceSeq.referenceSeqPointer.hbs`: Generates a MolecularSequence resource with a reference sequence pointer.
6. `specimen.hbs`: Creates a MolecularSequence resource with a specimen reference.
7. `variant.variantPointer.hbs`: Produces a MolecularSequence resource with a variant pointer.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, defining a partial FHIR MolecularSequence resource with focus on a specific attribute or reference.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely integrated with other components for full CDA to FHIR conversion.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include specific configuration options, they use Handlebars placeholders for dynamic value insertion. Common placeholders include:

- `{{ID}}`: For the unique identifier of the MolecularSequence resource
- `{{REF}}`: For the reference value specific to each template (e.g., device reference, patient reference, etc.)

These values are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered within the larger conversion system.

Here's an example of how these templates structure their output, using the `patient.hbs` template as an example:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MolecularSequence",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "patient": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

This structure is consistent across the templates, with variations in the specific attributes (e.g., "patient", "device", "performer") based on the template's purpose.

It's important to note that these templates generate partial resources, likely intended to be combined or nested within larger FHIR bundles or response structures. The consistent use of the "resource" wrapper suggests this integration into a broader FHIR document structure.

The templates in this directory play a crucial role in the CDA to FHIR conversion process, specifically for handling molecular sequence data. They provide a flexible and modular approach to generating different aspects of FHIR MolecularSequence resources, allowing for easy customization and extension of the conversion process as needed.
