### MolecularSequence Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MolecularSequence resource structure with a performer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MolecularSequence resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer of the molecular sequence |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MolecularSequence resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MolecularSequence",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "performer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "MolecularSequence"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `performer` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.
