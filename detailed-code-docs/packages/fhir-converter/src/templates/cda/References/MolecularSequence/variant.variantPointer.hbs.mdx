## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a variant pointer. It's part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### MolecularSequence Resource Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a FHIR MolecularSequence resource, focusing on the variant pointer aspect.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the MolecularSequence resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the variant pointer |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a variant pointer.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a MolecularSequence resource with the provided ID.
2. It includes a single variant in the `variant` array.
3. The variant contains a `variantPointer` object with a `reference` field set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the MolecularSequence resource |
| REF | string | The reference for the variant pointer |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be used within a FHIR converter system, specifically for handling CDA to FHIR conversions related to molecular sequences and variants.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for MolecularSequence resources, focusing on the variant pointer aspect.
4. This template appears to be a small part of a larger system for converting healthcare data between different formats (CDA and FHIR).
