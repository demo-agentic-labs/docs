## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a patient reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### MolecularSequence Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a patient reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MolecularSequence resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this molecular sequence |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MolecularSequence",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "patient": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "MolecularSequence".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. It creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The values for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in a directory structure suggesting it's used for CDA to FHIR conversion, specifically for MolecularSequence resources.
3. The structure of the output JSON suggests that this template might be used as part of a larger resource bundle, as it's wrapped in a "resource" object.
