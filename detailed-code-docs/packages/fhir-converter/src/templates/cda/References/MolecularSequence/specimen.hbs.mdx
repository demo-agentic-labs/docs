## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a specimen reference. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a molecular sequence linked to a specific specimen.

### MolecularSequence Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a specimen reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MolecularSequence resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated specimen |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MolecularSequence",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "specimen": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a MolecularSequence resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to inject dynamic values into the JSON.
3. The `resourceType` is set to "MolecularSequence".
4. The `id` field is populated with the provided `{{ID}}` value.
5. The `specimen` field contains a `reference` subfield, which is populated with the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with multiple contributors.
2. The template is designed to be used as part of a FHIR resource creation process, specifically for MolecularSequence resources.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for MolecularSequence resources, focusing on the specimen reference.
4. This template appears to be a part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources, possibly from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data, as suggested by the file path.
