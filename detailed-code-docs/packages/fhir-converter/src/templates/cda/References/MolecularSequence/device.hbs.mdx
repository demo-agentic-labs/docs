## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR MolecularSequence resource with a device reference. It's designed to generate a JSON structure representing a molecular sequence and its associated device.

### MolecularSequence Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MolecularSequence resource. It includes an ID and a device reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MolecularSequence resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR MolecularSequence resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "MolecularSequence"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `device` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for data insertion.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The generated JSON structure is nested within a `resource` object, which is itself within another object. This suggests it might be part of a larger FHIR bundle or response structure.
- The template is specifically designed for the MolecularSequence resource type in the FHIR standard, focusing on the device reference aspect of the resource.
