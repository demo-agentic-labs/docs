### ClinicalImpression Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource. It includes an ID and a reference to a previous clinical impression.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this ClinicalImpression resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the previous ClinicalImpression |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a 'resource' property.
2. Inside 'resource', it sets the 'resourceType' to "ClinicalImpression".
3. It sets the 'id' of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
4. It creates a 'previous' property with a nested 'reference' property, set to the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't include explicit error handling. It's assumed that the calling code will provide valid inputs for ID and REF.
