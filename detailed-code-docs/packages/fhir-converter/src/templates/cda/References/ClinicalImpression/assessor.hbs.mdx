### ClinicalImpression Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource with an assessor reference. The assessor is typically the healthcare provider who performed the clinical assessment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ClinicalImpression resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the assessor, typically a Practitioner or PractitionerRole resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ClinicalImpression",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "assessor": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ClinicalImpression"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `assessor` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and is likely called by other parts of the system to generate ClinicalImpression resources. The exact API for using this template would depend on the broader system's implementation.
