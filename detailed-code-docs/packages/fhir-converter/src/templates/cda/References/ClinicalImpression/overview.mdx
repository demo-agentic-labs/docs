## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR ClinicalImpression resources. These templates are part of a FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific part of the ClinicalImpression resource, such as assessor, encounter, findings, investigations, problems, prognosis, subject, and supporting information.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource. A ClinicalImpression in FHIR represents a clinician's assessment and plan for a patient. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various components of this resource, such as:

1. Identifying the healthcare provider who performed the assessment (assessor.hbs)
2. Linking the impression to a specific healthcare encounter (encounter.hbs)
3. Recording findings and references to other resources (finding.itemReference.hbs)
4. Documenting investigations performed as part of the assessment (investigation.item.hbs)
5. Referencing previous clinical impressions (previous.hbs)
6. Linking to problem statements (problem.hbs)
7. Including prognosis references (prognosisReference.hbs)
8. Identifying the subject (usually the patient) of the clinical impression (subject.hbs)
9. Adding references to supporting information (supportingInfo.hbs)

Each template generates a JSON structure that represents a part of the ClinicalImpression resource, which can then be combined to form a complete FHIR resource.

## Key Files
1. assessor.hbs: Creates a ClinicalImpression resource with an assessor reference.
2. encounter.hbs: Generates a ClinicalImpression resource with an encounter reference.
3. finding.itemReference.hbs: Produces a ClinicalImpression resource with a single finding that references another resource.
4. investigation.item.hbs: Creates a ClinicalImpression resource with an investigation item.
5. previous.hbs: Generates a ClinicalImpression resource with a reference to a previous clinical impression.
6. problem.hbs: Creates a ClinicalImpression resource with a problem reference.
7. prognosisReference.hbs: Produces a ClinicalImpression resource with a prognosis reference.
8. subject.hbs: Generates a ClinicalImpression resource with a subject reference.
9. supportingInfo.hbs: Creates a ClinicalImpression resource with supporting information reference.

Each of these files plays a crucial role in generating different aspects of a ClinicalImpression resource, allowing for flexible and modular creation of FHIR resources based on CDA data.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and variable substitution. They are designed to work within a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrating with other components that handle the overall conversion process, data mapping, and resource assembly.

## Configuration
The templates use a consistent pattern of configuration, typically requiring two main inputs:

1. ID: A unique identifier for the ClinicalImpression resource being created.
2. REF: A reference to another resource or piece of information relevant to the specific aspect of the ClinicalImpression being generated.

These inputs are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered, allowing for dynamic generation of resource components based on the specific data being converted.

It's important to note that these templates generate partial structures of a ClinicalImpression resource. The complete resource would likely be assembled by combining the outputs of multiple templates, along with additional data processing and mapping logic in the broader FHIR conversion system.
