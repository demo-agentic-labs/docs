### ClinicalImpression Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource with a single problem reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ClinicalImpression resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the problem associated with this clinical impression |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "ClinicalImpression"
- id: The provided ID
- problem: An array containing a single object with a reference to the associated problem

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resourceType to "ClinicalImpression"
2. Assigns the provided ID to the resource's id field
3. Creates a problem array with a single object containing the reference to the associated problem

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
This template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ClinicalImpression resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the problem associated with this clinical impression |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be used within a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
3. The output is a partial JSON structure, likely to be combined with other resources or wrapped in a larger JSON object.
4. The problem array is hardcoded to contain only one reference, which might limit its flexibility if multiple problems need to be associated with a single ClinicalImpression.
