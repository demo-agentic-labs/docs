## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a ClinicalImpression resource, focusing only on the subject reference. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
3. The output is structured as a nested JSON object, which suggests it might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or a more complex data structure.
