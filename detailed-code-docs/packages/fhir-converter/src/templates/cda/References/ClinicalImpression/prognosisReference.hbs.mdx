### ClinicalImpression Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource, focusing on the prognosisReference field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ClinicalImpression resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the prognosis resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the ClinicalImpression details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ClinicalImpression"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `prognosisReference`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "ClinicalImpression"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `prognosisReference` array with a single object
4. Sets the `reference` field of the prognosis object to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ClinicalImpression resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the prognosis resource |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The template generates a minimal ClinicalImpression resource structure, focusing only on the `id` and `prognosisReference` fields. Other fields that might be part of a complete ClinicalImpression resource are not included in this template.
