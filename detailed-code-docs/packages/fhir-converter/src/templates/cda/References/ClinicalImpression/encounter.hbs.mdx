### ClinicalImpression Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ClinicalImpression resource with an encounter reference. It's a partial template, likely to be used as part of a larger FHIR document or bundle.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ClinicalImpression resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR ClinicalImpression resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the ClinicalImpression details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "ClinicalImpression"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `encounter`: An object containing a reference to the associated encounter

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` placeholder is replaced with the actual ID value, and `{{REF}}` is replaced with the encounter reference.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR converters for transforming data from one format to another.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. Error management would typically be handled by the system using this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but rather a part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` values and outputs a JSON structure that conforms to the FHIR ClinicalImpression resource specification.
