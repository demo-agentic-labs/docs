### ClinicalImpression Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ClinicalImpression resource with `id` and `supportingInfo` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the ClinicalImpression resource |
| REF | String | The reference to supporting information |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR ClinicalImpression resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the resource type as "ClinicalImpression".
2. Sets the `id` field using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. Creates a `supportingInfo` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, populated with the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`).

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself but is likely used as part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It specifically handles the creation of a partial ClinicalImpression resource.
