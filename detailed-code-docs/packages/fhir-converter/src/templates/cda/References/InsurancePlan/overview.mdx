## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of the InsurancePlan resource in FHIR format. These templates are part of a FHIR converter, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific attribute or relationship of the InsurancePlan resource, such as administeredBy, coverage network, coverageArea, endpoint, network, ownedBy, and plan-specific details.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of different components of an InsurancePlan resource. They allow for the flexible construction of InsurancePlan resources by providing modular templates for various attributes. When used in combination, they can generate a complete InsurancePlan resource or specific parts of it as needed.

The templates handle different aspects of an insurance plan, such as:
1. Who administers the plan
2. The coverage network
3. The geographical area covered
4. Associated endpoints (e.g., for electronic communication)
5. The network of providers
6. The organization that owns the plan
7. Specific plan details including coverage areas and networks

Each template takes simple inputs (usually an ID and a reference) and outputs a JSON structure that represents a part of the InsurancePlan resource. This modular approach allows for easy customization and extension of the resource generation process.

## Key Files
1. `administeredBy.hbs`: Generates the "administeredBy" field, referencing the entity that administers the plan.
2. `coverage.network.hbs`: Creates the structure for the coverage network within the InsurancePlan.
3. `coverageArea.hbs`: Defines the geographical area covered by the insurance plan.
4. `endpoint.hbs`: Specifies the endpoint(s) associated with the InsurancePlan.
5. `network.hbs`: Represents the network of providers associated with the plan.
6. `ownedBy.hbs`: Indicates the organization that owns the insurance plan.
7. `plan.coverageArea.hbs`: Defines the coverage area specific to a particular plan within the InsurancePlan.
8. `plan.network.hbs`: Specifies the network associated with a particular plan within the InsurancePlan.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, creating a JSON object that represents a part of the InsurancePlan resource. They all use Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation, typically expecting an `ID` and a `REF` input.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering the JSON structures. The Handlebars engine is used to interpolate variables and generate the final JSON output.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible and modular. The main configuration comes from the input variables provided when rendering the templates:

1. `ID`: A unique identifier for the InsurancePlan resource or its components.
2. `REF`: A reference to associated entities or attributes, such as networks, coverage areas, or administering organizations.

These inputs allow for dynamic generation of the InsurancePlan resource components based on the specific data being converted.

In conclusion, this directory contains a set of modular templates that work together to generate various aspects of an InsurancePlan resource in FHIR format. They provide a flexible and extensible way to create InsurancePlan resources as part of a larger FHIR conversion process, likely transforming CDA data to FHIR format. The modular nature of these templates allows for easy customization and extension of the resource generation process to meet specific requirements or handle different data structures.
