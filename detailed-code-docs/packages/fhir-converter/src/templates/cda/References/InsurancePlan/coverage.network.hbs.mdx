### InsurancePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an InsurancePlan resource, with emphasis on the coverage network.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the InsurancePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to a network associated with the coverage |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an InsurancePlan resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the InsurancePlan resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "InsurancePlan"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `coverage`: An array containing coverage details
    - `network`: An array of network references

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets up the basic structure of an InsurancePlan resource.
2. It includes a single coverage item in the `coverage` array.
3. Within the coverage item, it defines a `network` array with a single reference.
4. The `ID` input is used to set the resource's `id` field.
5. The `REF` input is used to set the `reference` field of the network item.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`).

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
