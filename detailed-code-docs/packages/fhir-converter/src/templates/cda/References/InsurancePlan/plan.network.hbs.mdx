### InsurancePlan Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an InsurancePlan resource, including a single plan with a network reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the InsurancePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the network associated with the plan |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing an InsurancePlan resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an outer "resource" object
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "InsurancePlan"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "plan" array with a single object
5. Within the plan object, creates a "network" array with a single object
6. Sets the "reference" field of the network object to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used to generate the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the input variables (ID and REF) to populate the structure.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive ID and REF values and returns a JSON structure that can be incorporated into a full FHIR resource representation.

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Unique identifier for the InsurancePlan |
| REF | String | Reference to the associated network |

| Output | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | Partial InsurancePlan resource focusing on the network reference |

Note: This template is part of a larger system and may need to be combined with other templates or data to create a complete FHIR resource.
