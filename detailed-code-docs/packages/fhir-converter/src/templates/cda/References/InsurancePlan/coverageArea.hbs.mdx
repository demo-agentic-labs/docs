### InsurancePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR InsurancePlan resource with a coverageArea field. The coverageArea is represented as an array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the InsurancePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the coverageArea |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR InsurancePlan resource with the following structure:
- resource
  - resourceType: "InsurancePlan"
  - id: (value of ID input)
  - coverageArea: An array containing a single object with a reference field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the resourceType to "InsurancePlan".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the id of the resource.
3. It creates a coverageArea array with a single object.
4. Within the coverageArea object, it sets the reference field using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
