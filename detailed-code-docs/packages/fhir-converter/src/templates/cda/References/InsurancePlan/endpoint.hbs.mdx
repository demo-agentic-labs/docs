## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for an InsurancePlan resource in FHIR format. It specifically focuses on the endpoint attribute of the InsurancePlan resource, providing a basic structure for including endpoint references.

### InsurancePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an InsurancePlan resource with an endpoint reference. It's designed to be used within a FHIR context, likely as part of a larger data transformation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the InsurancePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the endpoint associated with the InsurancePlan |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial InsurancePlan resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "InsurancePlan",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "endpoint": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "InsurancePlan".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's id.
3. It creates an `endpoint` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the endpoint reference.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure suggests this is part of a larger FHIR resource generation system, likely used in a healthcare data integration context.
3. The template only defines a partial resource structure. In a complete FHIR InsurancePlan resource, there would typically be additional attributes beyond just the id and endpoint.
4. The endpoint array is structured to allow multiple endpoints, but this template only includes one. If multiple endpoints are needed, the template would need to be modified or iterated over a collection of endpoint references.
