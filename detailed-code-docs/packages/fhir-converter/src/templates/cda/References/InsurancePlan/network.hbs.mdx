### InsurancePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an InsurancePlan resource with a focus on the network attribute. It includes placeholders for the resource's ID and a reference to the network.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the InsurancePlan resource |
| REF | String | A reference to the network associated with the insurance plan |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing an InsurancePlan resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the InsurancePlan details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "InsurancePlan"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `network`: An array containing a single object with a reference to the network

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `network` attribute is represented as an array with a single object, allowing for potential expansion to multiple networks if needed.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering the JSON structure with dynamic values.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The structure is fixed, with only the `ID` and `REF` values being customizable.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the copyright of Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The JSON structure is minimal and focused solely on the network attribute of an InsurancePlan resource. It may need to be combined with other templates or extended to represent a complete InsurancePlan resource according to the FHIR specification.
4. The template uses a comma after the closing bracket of the `network` array, which might need to be removed if this is intended to be valid JSON. However, this could be intentional if the template is designed to be part of a larger structure.
