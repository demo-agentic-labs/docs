### RiskAssessment Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR RiskAssessment resource with a reasonReference field. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the reason for the risk assessment |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR RiskAssessment resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "RiskAssessment"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "reasonReference" array with a single object containing a "reference" field
5. Inserts the provided REF value into the "reference" field

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive ID and REF values when rendered, likely from a parent template or a data context.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the reason for the risk assessment |
