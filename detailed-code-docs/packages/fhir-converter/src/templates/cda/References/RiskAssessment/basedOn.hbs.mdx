### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object representing a FHIR RiskAssessment resource with a `basedOn` reference. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the resource on which this RiskAssessment is based |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR RiskAssessment resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "RiskAssessment".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `basedOn` object with a `reference` property, setting its value to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure with the provided input values.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax to insert values into predefined locations in the JSON structure.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.
