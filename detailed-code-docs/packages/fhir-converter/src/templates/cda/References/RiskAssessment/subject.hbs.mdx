### RiskAssessment Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR RiskAssessment resource. It specifically defines the `subject` field of the RiskAssessment, which is a reference to the subject of the risk assessment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the risk assessment |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR RiskAssessment resource with a subject reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "RiskAssessment".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't include explicit error handling. It's assumed that the calling context will provide valid values for ID and REF.
