### RiskAssessment Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR RiskAssessment resource with a condition reference. It's a partial template that would likely be used as part of a larger FHIR document conversion process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the condition associated with this risk assessment |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR RiskAssessment resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "RiskAssessment",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "condition": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a FHIR RiskAssessment resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "RiskAssessment".
3. It uses the provided `ID` to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `condition` object with a `reference` field, using the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a RiskAssessment resource. In a full FHIR document, there would likely be additional fields and possibly nested resources.
3. The use of double curly braces (`{{}}`) around `ID` and `REF` indicates that these are placeholder values to be replaced when the template is processed.
4. The structure of the output suggests that this template might be used as part of an array of resources in a larger FHIR document.
