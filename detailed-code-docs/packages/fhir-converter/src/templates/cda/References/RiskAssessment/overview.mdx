## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR RiskAssessment resources with various reference fields. These templates are part of a FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format.

## What does it do?
These templates create JSON structures representing different aspects of a FHIR RiskAssessment resource. Each template focuses on a specific reference field within the RiskAssessment resource, such as basedOn, basis, condition, encounter, parent, performer, reasonReference, and subject. When used together, these templates allow for the creation of comprehensive RiskAssessment resources with various reference types.

The templates use Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for resource IDs and references, making them flexible and reusable across different conversion scenarios. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion process, likely used in conjunction with other templates and helper functions to generate complete FHIR resources.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Creates a RiskAssessment resource with a `basedOn` reference, indicating the resource on which this assessment is based.
2. `basis.hbs`: Generates a RiskAssessment resource with a `basis` field, referencing the information on which the assessment is based.
3. `condition.hbs`: Produces a RiskAssessment resource with a `condition` reference, linking to the condition associated with the risk assessment.
4. `encounter.hbs`: Creates a RiskAssessment resource with an `encounter` reference, connecting the assessment to a specific healthcare encounter.
5. `parent.hbs`: Generates a RiskAssessment resource with a `parent` reference, indicating a parent risk assessment.
6. `performer.hbs`: Produces a RiskAssessment resource with a `performer` field, referencing the entity that performed the assessment.
7. `reasonReference.hbs`: Creates a RiskAssessment resource with a `reasonReference` field, providing a reference to the reason for the assessment.
8. `subject.hbs`: Generates a RiskAssessment resource with a `subject` reference, indicating the subject of the risk assessment.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "RiskAssessment",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "{{fieldName}}": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

Where `{{fieldName}}` is replaced by the specific reference field (e.g., basedOn, basis, condition, etc.), and `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are placeholders for the resource ID and reference value, respectively.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structures with the provided input values.

## Configuration
The templates don't include specific configuration options. They use Handlebars syntax to insert values into predefined locations in the JSON structure. The behavior of each template is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates are designed to be flexible, allowing the ID and reference values to be dynamically inserted when rendered.
3. These templates represent partial RiskAssessment resources. In a full FHIR document, there would likely be additional fields and possibly nested resources.
4. The templates assume that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided correctly when rendered. There is no explicit error handling implemented in the templates.
5. The generated JSON structures are nested within a `resource` object, suggesting they might be used as part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
