### RiskAssessment Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object for a FHIR RiskAssessment resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a parent reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the parent resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant RiskAssessment resource object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "RiskAssessment"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `parent` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to FHIR format.
3. The generated JSON structure is nested within a `resource` object, suggesting it might be used as part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
4. The template only defines the basic structure of a RiskAssessment resource with a parent reference. In a real-world scenario, a RiskAssessment resource would typically include additional fields such as subject, occurrence, condition, and prediction.
