### RiskAssessment Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR RiskAssessment resource with an encounter reference. It's a partial template that would likely be used as part of a larger FHIR document conversion process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR RiskAssessment resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "RiskAssessment",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "encounter": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure. The `resourceType` is hardcoded as "RiskAssessment", and the `encounter` field is populated with a reference object containing the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
