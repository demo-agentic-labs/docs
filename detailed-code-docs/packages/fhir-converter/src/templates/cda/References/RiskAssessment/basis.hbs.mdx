### RiskAssessment Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR RiskAssessment resource. It specifically defines the 'basis' field, which is used to reference the information on which the assessment is based.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the basis of the risk assessment |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR RiskAssessment resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "RiskAssessment",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "basis": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}",
            },
        ],
    },
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "RiskAssessment".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's unique identifier.
3. In the `basis` array, it includes a single object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure adheres to the FHIR standard for RiskAssessment resources, specifically focusing on the 'basis' field.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the ID and reference to be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
