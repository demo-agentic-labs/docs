### RiskAssessment Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR RiskAssessment resource with a focus on the `performer` field. It sets up the basic structure of the resource and includes placeholders for the resource ID and the performer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RiskAssessment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer of the risk assessment |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR RiskAssessment resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "RiskAssessment"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the resource's `id` field
3. Creates a `performer` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and helper functions to generate complete FHIR resources.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for dynamic content insertion:
- `{{ID}}`: Placeholder for the resource ID
- `{{REF}}`: Placeholder for the performer reference

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No specific logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
