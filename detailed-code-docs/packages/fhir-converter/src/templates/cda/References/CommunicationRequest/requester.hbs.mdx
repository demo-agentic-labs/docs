## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial structure for a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource, specifically focusing on the `requester` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### CommunicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource. It specifically defines the `requester` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the CommunicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the requester of the communication |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR CommunicationRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CommunicationRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "requester": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CommunicationRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's `id` field.
3. The `requester` field is set with a `reference` subfield, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a CommunicationRequest resource, likely to be combined with other templates to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that these values will be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and ends with trailing commas, suggesting it's meant to be part of a larger JSON object.
