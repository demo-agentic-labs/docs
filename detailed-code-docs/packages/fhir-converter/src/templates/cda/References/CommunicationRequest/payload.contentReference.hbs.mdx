### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource. The template focuses on creating the payload section of the resource with a content reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the CommunicationRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference value for the content reference in the payload |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "CommunicationRequest".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "payload" array with a single object.
5. Within the payload object, creates a "contentReference" object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the "payload.contentReference" part of a CommunicationRequest resource, suggesting it might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
3. The structure adheres to the FHIR standard for CommunicationRequest resources, focusing on the payload section with a content reference.
