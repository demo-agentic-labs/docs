### CommunicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CommunicationRequest resource structure with a 'subject' field. It's likely part of a larger template system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the CommunicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the communication request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR CommunicationRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a 'resource' object with 'resourceType' set to "CommunicationRequest"
2. Sets the 'id' of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input
3. Defines a 'subject' object within the resource, containing a 'reference' field set to the provided `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation, indicated by the `{{}}` syntax.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a CommunicationRequest resource, likely to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment, as indicated by the trailing commas. This suggests it's meant to be inserted into a larger JSON structure.
