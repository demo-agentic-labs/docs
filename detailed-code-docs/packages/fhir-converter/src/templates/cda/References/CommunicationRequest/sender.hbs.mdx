### CommunicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource. It specifically defines the `sender` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CommunicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the sender of the communication request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR CommunicationRequest resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CommunicationRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "sender": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CommunicationRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. The `sender` field is populated with a `reference` object, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial structure of a CommunicationRequest resource, focusing solely on the `sender` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
4. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that these values are expected to be provided dynamically when the template is rendered.
