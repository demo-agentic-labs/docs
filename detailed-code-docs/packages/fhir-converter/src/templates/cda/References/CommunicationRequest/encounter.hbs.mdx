1. The template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "CommunicationRequest".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates an `encounter` object within the resource, containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used to render this template |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
