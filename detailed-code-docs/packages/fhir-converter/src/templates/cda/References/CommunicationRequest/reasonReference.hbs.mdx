### CommunicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource with a reasonReference field. The reasonReference is an array containing a single reference object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CommunicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CommunicationRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "reasonReference": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a CommunicationRequest resource type.
2. It sets the `id` field using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. It creates a `reasonReference` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, populated with the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is designed to work within the Handlebars templating system.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The structure of the CommunicationRequest resource is fixed, with placeholders for the `id` and `reference` values.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the Microsoft portion is provided under a more permissive license.
3. This template is specifically for the `reasonReference` field of a CommunicationRequest resource, suggesting it's part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
4. The template uses minimal Handlebars syntax, only utilizing simple variable substitution with `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`.
