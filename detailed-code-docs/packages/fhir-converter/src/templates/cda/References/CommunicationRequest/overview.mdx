## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource. These templates are designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format, specifically for creating different aspects of a CommunicationRequest resource.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource. Each template focuses on a specific field or aspect of the CommunicationRequest, such as the subject, sender, requester, recipient, and various references. When used in combination, they can generate a complete CommunicationRequest resource that adheres to the FHIR specification.

The templates use placeholders (typically {{ID}} and {{REF}}) which are filled in with actual data during the conversion process. This allows for dynamic generation of FHIR resources based on the input CDA data.

## Key Files
1. about.hbs: Generates the "about" field of the CommunicationRequest, which links the request to other resources it pertains to.
2. basedOn.hbs: Creates the "basedOn" field, referencing another resource that this communication request is based on.
3. encounter.hbs: Adds an encounter reference to the CommunicationRequest.
4. payload.contentReference.hbs: Focuses on creating the payload section of the resource with a content reference.
5. reasonReference.hbs: Adds a reason for the communication request.
6. recipient.hbs: Defines the recipient of the communication request.
7. replaces.hbs: Indicates that this communication request is replacing a previous one.
8. requester.hbs: Specifies the requester of the communication.
9. sender.hbs: Defines the sender of the communication request.
10. subject.hbs: Specifies the subject of the communication request.

Each of these templates generates a partial JSON structure that represents a specific part of a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource. They are designed to be combined to form a complete resource.

## Dependencies
These templates are part of a larger FHIR conversion system and depend on:
1. Handlebars: The templating engine used to process these templates and generate the final JSON structures.
2. FHIR specification: The templates adhere to the FHIR standard for CommunicationRequest resources.

## Configuration
These templates don't include specific configuration options. They use a fixed structure for each part of the CommunicationRequest resource, with placeholders (typically {{ID}} and {{REF}}) for dynamic data insertion.

## Notes
1. Each template file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are part of a project maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license, and incorporate work originally from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The templates are designed to be partial representations of a CommunicationRequest resource, likely to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The JSON structures in most templates are not complete and often end with trailing commas, suggesting they're meant to be part of a larger JSON object.
4. While most fields in these templates allow for single values, in a full FHIR implementation, some fields (like recipients or reasonReferences) might support multiple values. The templates would need to be modified or used with additional logic to support such cases.
5. These templates focus solely on the structure of the CommunicationRequest resource and do not include any data validation or error handling. Such functionality would need to be implemented in the broader conversion system that uses these templates.
