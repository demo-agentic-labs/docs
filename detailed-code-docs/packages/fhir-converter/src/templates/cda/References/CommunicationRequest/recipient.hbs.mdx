### CommunicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CommunicationRequest resource with a focus on the recipient field. It sets up the basic structure of the resource and includes placeholders for the resource ID and recipient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CommunicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the recipient of the communication request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR CommunicationRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "CommunicationRequest"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the resource's `id` field
3. Creates a `recipient` array with a single object containing a `reference` field
4. Uses the provided `REF` value as the recipient's reference

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the CommunicationRequest resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the recipient reference |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a CommunicationRequest resource, likely to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for CommunicationRequest resources, specifically focusing on the recipient field.
4. The template only includes a single recipient in the array, but the FHIR specification allows for multiple recipients. If multiple recipients are needed, the template would need to be modified or used in conjunction with other logic to support this.
