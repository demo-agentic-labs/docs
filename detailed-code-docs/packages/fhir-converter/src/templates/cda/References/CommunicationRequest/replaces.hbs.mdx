### CommunicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource. It specifically focuses on the 'replaces' field, which indicates that this communication request is replacing a previous one.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this CommunicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the CommunicationRequest being replaced |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant CommunicationRequest resource JSON object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a 'resource' property
2. Sets the 'resourceType' to "CommunicationRequest"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the 'id' field
4. Creates a 'replaces' array with a single object containing a 'reference' field
5. Sets the 'reference' field to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the CommunicationRequest resource.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The 'replaces' field is an array, but this template only includes a single replacement reference. If multiple replacements are needed, the template would need to be modified.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and seems to be a part of a larger FHIR resource bundle, as indicated by the outer 'resource' object.
