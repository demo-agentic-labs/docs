### CommunicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource. It specifically populates the "about" field, which is used to link the communication request to other resources it pertains to.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the CommunicationRequest resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to another resource that this communication request is about |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR CommunicationRequest resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "CommunicationRequest".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. Creates an "about" array with a single object containing a "reference" property set to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template is configured to generate a specific structure for a CommunicationRequest resource. The structure is fixed, with only the "id" and the reference in the "about" array being variable.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions as stated in the notice.
3. The template focuses solely on the "about" field of the CommunicationRequest resource. Other fields that might be part of a complete CommunicationRequest are not included in this template.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment, as indicated by the trailing commas at the end of the object and array.
