### Slot Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Slot resource, which represents a specific time period on a Schedule when a service may be performed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Slot resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated Schedule resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resource | Object | A FHIR Slot resource object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a FHIR resource object with the resourceType "Slot".
2. It sets the `id` of the Slot resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. It creates a `schedule` property with a `reference` sub-property, setting its value to the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the FHIR resource |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and content of the Slot resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and Schedule references to be passed in for each use.
3. This template creates a minimal Slot resource. In a full FHIR implementation, additional properties might be needed depending on the use case.
