It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### AllergyIntolerance Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource with an `asserter` field. The `asserter` represents the person or organization that asserts the allergy or intolerance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the AllergyIntolerance resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the asserter (person or organization) |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource with the `asserter` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "AllergyIntolerance".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates an `asserter` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
