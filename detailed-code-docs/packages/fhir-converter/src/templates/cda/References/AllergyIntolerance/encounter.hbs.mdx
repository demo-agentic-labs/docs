## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for an AllergyIntolerance resource in FHIR format, specifically focusing on the encounter reference within the resource. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### AllergyIntolerance Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an AllergyIntolerance resource, including an encounter reference. It's part of a larger FHIR conversion process, likely used when transforming allergy information from CDA to FHIR format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the AllergyIntolerance resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial AllergyIntolerance resource in FHIR format, focusing on the encounter reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "AllergyIntolerance".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the resource's `id`.
4. It creates an `encounter` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger conversion process.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the system using this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but is likely used as part of a larger FHIR conversion API or process.
