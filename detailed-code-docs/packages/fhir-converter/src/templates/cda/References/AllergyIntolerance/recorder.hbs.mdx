## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) AllergyIntolerance resource structure, specifically focusing on the `recorder` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### AllergyIntolerance Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource with a focus on the `recorder` field. The `recorder` represents the individual who recorded the allergy or intolerance information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the AllergyIntolerance resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the recorder of the allergy or intolerance |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource with the `recorder` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure for the AllergyIntolerance resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "AllergyIntolerance".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `recorder` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
