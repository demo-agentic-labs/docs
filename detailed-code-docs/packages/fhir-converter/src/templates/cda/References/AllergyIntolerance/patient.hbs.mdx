## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating an AllergyIntolerance resource in FHIR format, specifically focusing on the patient reference within the resource. It's part of a FHIR converter system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format.

### AllergyIntolerance Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource structure, focusing on the patient reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template or system for converting health data to FHIR format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the AllergyIntolerance resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this allergy intolerance |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing part of a FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "AllergyIntolerance".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "patient" object with a "reference" field, populated by the REF input.

## Dependencies
This template likely depends on a Handlebars templating engine to process the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. Error management would likely be handled by the system using this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it contributes to creating a FHIR-compliant resource. The structure adheres to the FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource specification, specifically for the patient reference.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | String | Always set to "AllergyIntolerance" |
| id | String | Unique identifier for the AllergyIntolerance resource |
| patient.reference | String | Reference to the associated patient |

Note: This template appears to be a partial representation of an AllergyIntolerance resource, focusing only on the patient reference. In a complete FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource, additional fields would typically be present.
