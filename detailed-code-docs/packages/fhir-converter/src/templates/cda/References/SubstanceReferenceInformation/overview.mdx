## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) SubstanceReferenceInformation resources. The templates focus on different aspects of the SubstanceReferenceInformation resource, including classification, gene, geneElement, and target information.

## What does it do?
These templates are used to create structured JSON objects that represent SubstanceReferenceInformation resources in the FHIR standard. Each template focuses on a specific part of the resource:

1. Classification source: Creates a resource with classification information.
2. Gene source: Generates a resource with gene-related data.
3. Gene element source: Produces a resource with gene element details.
4. Target source: Builds a resource with target information.

These templates allow for the dynamic generation of FHIR-compliant SubstanceReferenceInformation resources, which can be used in healthcare information systems to represent various aspects of substance-related data.

## Key Files
1. `classification.source.hbs`: Template for creating a SubstanceReferenceInformation resource with classification source information.
2. `gene.source.hbs`: Template for generating a SubstanceReferenceInformation resource with gene source data.
3. `geneElement.source.hbs`: Template for producing a SubstanceReferenceInformation resource with gene element source details.
4. `target.source.hbs`: Template for building a SubstanceReferenceInformation resource with target source information.

Each of these files follows a similar structure but focuses on a different aspect of the SubstanceReferenceInformation resource. They all use the same basic inputs (ID and REF) to create their respective JSON structures.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering. No specific versions are mentioned in the provided summaries.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in these templates. They are designed to be flexible and can be easily modified or extended as needed.

Here's an example of how the `classification.source.hbs` template structures its output:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "SubstanceReferenceInformation",
  "id": "{{ID}}",
  "classification": [
    {
      "source": [
        {
          "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The other templates follow a similar structure, with variations in the specific fields they populate (e.g., "gene", "geneElement", or "target" instead of "classification").

These templates are part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporate work from Microsoft Corporation. They are licensed under AGPLv3, as indicated by the comprehensive copyright and license notices included at the beginning of each file.

The templates do not implement any explicit error handling. They assume that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided and valid when the templates are rendered. This design choice allows for flexibility in how these templates are used within a larger system but also requires careful management of inputs to ensure correct output.

In summary, this directory provides a set of templates for generating different aspects of FHIR SubstanceReferenceInformation resources, allowing for easy creation of standardized, interoperable healthcare data structures related to substance information.
