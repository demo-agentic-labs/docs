### Basic Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Basic resource with a subject reference. The Basic resource is a generic resource type in FHIR that can be used for information that doesn't fit into other resource types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Basic resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the Basic resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Basic resource with a subject reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Basic".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "subject" object with a "reference" property, using the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses two input variables:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ID | String | N/A | The unique identifier for the Basic resource |
| REF | String | N/A | The reference to the subject of the Basic resource |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be used within a larger system that can provide the necessary ID and REF values.
3. The output JSON structure is not complete and seems to be part of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the trailing commas.
4. This template follows the FHIR resource structure, specifically for a Basic resource type with a subject reference.
