## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Basic resources with specific references. The templates are designed to generate JSON structures representing Basic resources with either an author or a subject reference, which are commonly used in healthcare data exchange.

## What does it do?
These templates are used to create standardized JSON structures for FHIR Basic resources. They allow for the dynamic insertion of unique identifiers and references, which is crucial in healthcare data management. The Basic resource type in FHIR is a generic resource that can be used for information that doesn't fit into other more specific resource types.

The templates provide a way to:
1. Create a Basic resource with an author reference, which could be used to indicate who created or is responsible for the resource.
2. Create a Basic resource with a subject reference, which could be used to link the resource to a patient or other entity that the resource is about.

These templates serve as building blocks in a larger system for generating FHIR-compliant data structures, allowing for consistent and standardized representation of healthcare information.

## Key Files

1. `author.hbs`: This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Basic resource with an author reference. It takes an ID and a REF as inputs and outputs a JSON object representing the Basic resource with the author field populated.

2. `subject.hbs`: This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Basic resource with a subject reference. Similar to the author template, it takes an ID and a REF as inputs and outputs a JSON object representing the Basic resource with the subject field populated.

Both templates follow a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Basic",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "{{type}}": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
},
```

Where `{{type}}` is either "author" or "subject" depending on the template.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are designed to be used within a larger system that can provide the necessary ID and REF values.

## Configuration
The templates don't define any specific configuration options. They use two input variables:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID     | String | The unique identifier for the Basic resource |
| REF    | String | The reference to the author or subject of the resource |

## Notes
1. The templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they're part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The output JSON structures are not complete and seem to be part of larger JSON objects, as indicated by the trailing commas.
3. These templates follow the FHIR resource structure, specifically for Basic resource types with author or subject references.
4. The templates assume that the ID and REF placeholders will be properly populated when rendered, and do not implement explicit error handling.
5. These templates serve as essential components in a larger FHIR data conversion or generation system, providing standardized ways to create Basic resources with specific references.
