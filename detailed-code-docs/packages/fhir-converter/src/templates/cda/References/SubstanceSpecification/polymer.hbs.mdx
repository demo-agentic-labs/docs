### SubstanceSpecification Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource, including a polymer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The identifier for the SubstanceSpecification resource |
| REF  | String | The reference for the polymer |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "SubstanceSpecification".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "polymer" object with a "reference" field, populated by the REF input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF inputs will be provided correctly.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions as stated in the notice.
3. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
4. The resulting JSON structure is not complete and would likely be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle.
