## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for creating a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource with a focus on the `structure.source` element. It provides a basic skeleton for the resource, including the resource type, ID, and a single source reference within the structure.

### SubstanceSpecification Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource. It specifically populates the `structure.source` element with a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the SubstanceSpecification resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the source within the structure |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "SubstanceSpecification"
  - `id`: The identifier of the resource
  - `structure`: Contains information about the substance's structure
    - `source`: An array of source references
      - `reference`: The reference value for the source

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "SubstanceSpecification".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the resource's `id`.
3. Within the `structure` object, it creates a `source` array with a single object.
4. The `source` object contains a `reference` field, populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license as part of Metriport Inc.
2. The structure of the JSON is minimal and focused solely on the `structure.source` element of a SubstanceSpecification resource. It may need to be expanded to include other required or optional elements for a complete FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource.
3. The template uses comma-first notation for the JSON structure, which is an uncommon but valid style.
