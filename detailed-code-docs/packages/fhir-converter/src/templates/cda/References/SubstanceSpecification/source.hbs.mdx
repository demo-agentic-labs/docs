### SubstanceSpecification Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a source reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the SubstanceSpecification resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the source of the SubstanceSpecification |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "SubstanceSpecification"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `source` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, which is set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and seems to be a part of a larger object, as indicated by the comma at the end and the nested structure.
