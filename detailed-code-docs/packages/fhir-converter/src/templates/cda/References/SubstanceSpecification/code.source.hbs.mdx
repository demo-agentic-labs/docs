### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource. It includes placeholders for an ID and a reference source within the code array.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the SubstanceSpecification resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the source of the code |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "SubstanceSpecification".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `code` array with a single object.
5. Within the code object, creates a `source` array with a single object.
6. Sets the `reference` property of the source object to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The structure follows the FHIR specification for SubstanceSpecification resources, specifically focusing on the `code.source` element.
- This template is likely part of a larger system for generating FHIR resources from other data formats, possibly as part of a data conversion or interoperability solution.
