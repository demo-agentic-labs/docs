## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) SubstanceSpecification resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect or element of the SubstanceSpecification resource.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource. They allow for the dynamic generation of various elements within the resource, such as codes, names, nucleic acids, polymers, proteins, and relationships. By using placeholders for IDs and references, these templates can be populated with actual data during the conversion process from CDA to FHIR.

## Key Files
1. `code.source.hbs`: Generates the `code.source` element of a SubstanceSpecification.
2. `name.source.hbs`: Creates the `name.source` element.
3. `nucleicAcid.hbs`: Produces the `nucleicAcid` reference.
4. `polymer.hbs`: Generates the `polymer` reference.
5. `protein.hbs`: Creates the `protein` reference.
6. `referenceInformation.hbs`: Produces the `referenceInformation` element.
7. `relationship.source.hbs` and `relationship.substanceReference.hbs`: Generate different aspects of substance relationships.
8. `source.hbs`: Creates the main `source` element.
9. `sourceMaterial.hbs`: Generates the `sourceMaterial` reference.
10. `structure.source.hbs`: Produces the `structure.source` element.

Each of these templates focuses on a specific part of the SubstanceSpecification resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource creation.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated with other components that handle data input, processing, and output.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have explicit configuration options, they use placeholders (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) that need to be populated with actual data when the templates are rendered. The configuration of how these placeholders are filled would be handled by the broader FHIR conversion system.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they incorporate work from Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates generate partial JSON structures, often nested within a `resource` object. These would likely be combined or further processed to create complete FHIR resources.
3. Error handling is not implemented within the templates themselves. The system using these templates would need to ensure that the required data is provided and handle any potential errors in data population or structure generation.
4. The modular nature of these templates allows for flexible and extensible resource creation, as different elements can be included or excluded as needed for specific use cases.
5. The templates follow FHIR specifications for the SubstanceSpecification resource, ensuring that the generated structures are compliant with FHIR standards.
