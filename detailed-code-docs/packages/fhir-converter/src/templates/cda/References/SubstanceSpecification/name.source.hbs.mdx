### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource. It specifically populates the 'name' and 'source' fields of the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the SubstanceSpecification resource |
| REF  | String | The reference value for the source of the substance name |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a 'resource' object with 'resourceType' set to "SubstanceSpecification".
2. Sets the 'id' of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}`.
3. Creates a 'name' array with a single object.
4. Within the 'name' object, creates a 'source' array with a single object.
5. Sets the 'reference' of the source object to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON output adheres to the FHIR specification for SubstanceSpecification resources.
3. The template is minimal and focused, only populating specific fields (id, name, and source) of the SubstanceSpecification resource.
4. The use of nested arrays in the JSON structure (for 'name' and 'source') allows for potential expansion to include multiple names or sources, although this template only includes one of each.
