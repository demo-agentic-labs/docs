## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) SubstanceSpecification resource. The template specifically focuses on the `property.definingSubstanceReference` field of the SubstanceSpecification resource.

## Symbols

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource. It specifically populates the `property.definingSubstanceReference` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the SubstanceSpecification resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the defining substance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "SubstanceSpecification".
3. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. It creates a `property` array with a single object.
5. This object contains a `definingSubstanceReference` field, which in turn has a `reference` field set to the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` placeholders will be properly populated when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
3. The generated JSON structure is not complete and would likely be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle.
4. The template focuses solely on the `property.definingSubstanceReference` field, suggesting that other aspects of the SubstanceSpecification resource might be handled by other templates or parts of the system.
