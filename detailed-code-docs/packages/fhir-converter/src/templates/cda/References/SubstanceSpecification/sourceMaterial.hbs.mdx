#### Inputs

| REF | String | The reference to the source material |

#### Outputs

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "SubstanceSpecification"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "sourceMaterial" object with a "reference" property, using the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for dynamic content.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.
