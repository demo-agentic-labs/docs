### SubstanceSpecification Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource with a single relationship to another substance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this SubstanceSpecification resource |
| REF | String | The reference URL to the related substance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant SubstanceSpecification resource JSON object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a "resource" object with "resourceType" set to "SubstanceSpecification"
2. Sets the "id" of the resource to the provided `{{ID}}`
3. Defines a "relationship" array with a single object
4. Within the relationship object, creates a "substanceReference" object with a "reference" property set to the provided `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The structure is fixed, and the only customizable parts are the ID and reference URL.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather creates a data structure that could be used as part of a FHIR API response or request body.
