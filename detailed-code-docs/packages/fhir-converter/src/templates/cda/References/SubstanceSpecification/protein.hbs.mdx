### SubstanceSpecification Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object representing a FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource with a protein reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the SubstanceSpecification resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the protein associated with this substance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant SubstanceSpecification resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "SubstanceSpecification"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "protein" object with a "reference" property, using the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values are provided correctly.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
4. The resulting JSON structure is not complete and would likely be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle.
