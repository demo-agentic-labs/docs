## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource with a `derivedFrom` property. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a device use statement that is derived from another resource.

### DeviceUseStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource. It includes an `id` and a `derivedFrom` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DeviceUseStatement resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource from which this DeviceUseStatement is derived |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant DeviceUseStatement resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "DeviceUseStatement"
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input
3. Creates a `derivedFrom` array with a single object containing a `reference` property set to the provided `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The structure of the DeviceUseStatement resource is fixed, with placeholders for dynamic values.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a DeviceUseStatement resource, focusing specifically on the `derivedFrom` property. It may be intended to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other partial templates to create a complete FHIR resource.
3. The JSON structure is not complete (it's wrapped in extra curly braces), suggesting it might be meant to be included in a larger JSON structure.
