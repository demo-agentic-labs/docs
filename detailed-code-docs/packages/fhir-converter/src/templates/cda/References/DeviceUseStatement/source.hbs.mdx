## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource, specifically focusing on the source attribute. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a DeviceUseStatement with a source reference.

### DeviceUseStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a source reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the DeviceUseStatement |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the source of the DeviceUseStatement |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON representation of a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceUseStatement"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `source` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The generated JSON structure is nested within a "resource" object, which might be part of a larger FHIR bundle or response structure.
3. The template focuses solely on the `source` attribute of a DeviceUseStatement, suggesting it might be part of a larger set of templates for creating complete DeviceUseStatement resources.
4. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests this template might be designed to be part of a larger array or object in the final output.
