### DeviceUseStatement Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object for a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reference to a device.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DeviceUseStatement |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant DeviceUseStatement resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceUseStatement"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `device` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template produces a minimal DeviceUseStatement resource. In a real-world scenario, additional fields might be necessary to provide a complete and useful resource.
3. The output JSON structure is nested within a "resource" object, which suggests this template might be used as part of a larger FHIR bundle or transaction.
