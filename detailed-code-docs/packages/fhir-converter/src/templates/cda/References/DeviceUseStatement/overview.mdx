## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating various aspects of FHIR DeviceUseStatement resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter project, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific attribute or reference within a DeviceUseStatement resource.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to generate JSON representations of different parts of a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource. They allow for the creation of structured data that represents various aspects of how a device is used in a healthcare context. For example:

1. Linking the device use to other resources it's based on or derived from
2. Specifying the actual device being used
3. Providing reasons for the device use
4. Identifying the source of the information
5. Specifying the subject (usually a patient) associated with the device use

Each template takes in specific inputs (typically an ID and a reference) and outputs a JSON structure that conforms to the FHIR specification for DeviceUseStatement resources.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Creates a DeviceUseStatement with a `basedOn` property, linking it to other resources it's based on.
2. `derivedFrom.hbs`: Generates a DeviceUseStatement with a `derivedFrom` property, indicating resources from which this statement is derived.
3. `device.hbs`: Produces a DeviceUseStatement with a `device` property, referencing the actual device being used.
4. `reasonReference.hbs`: Creates a DeviceUseStatement with a `reasonReference` property, providing reasons for the device use.
5. `source.hbs`: Generates a DeviceUseStatement with a `source` property, identifying the origin of the information.
6. `subject.hbs`: Produces a DeviceUseStatement with a `subject` property, specifying the individual associated with the device use.

Each of these templates focuses on a specific aspect of the DeviceUseStatement resource, allowing for modular construction of the complete resource.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON output. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated with other components that handle the overall conversion process from CDA to FHIR format.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include explicit configuration options, they use Handlebars placeholders for dynamic content. The two main placeholders used across all templates are:

1. `{{ID}}`: For the unique identifier of the DeviceUseStatement resource
2. `{{REF}}`: For the reference value specific to each template (e.g., device reference, subject reference, etc.)

These placeholders would be populated by the larger conversion system when rendering the templates.

## Notes
1. All templates in this directory include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates produce partial DeviceUseStatement resources, each focusing on a specific attribute. In a real-world scenario, these would likely be combined to create a complete and valid FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource.
3. The JSON structures in these templates are nested within a "resource" object, suggesting they might be used as part of a larger FHIR bundle or transaction.
4. The templates assume that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided correctly when rendered. There's no explicit error handling for missing or invalid inputs.
5. These templates demonstrate a modular approach to constructing FHIR resources, allowing for flexibility in how DeviceUseStatement resources are created and composed.
