## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource with a `basedOn` property. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a device use statement that is based on another resource.

### DeviceUseStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource. It includes an `id` and a `basedOn` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DeviceUseStatement resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource this DeviceUseStatement is based on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant DeviceUseStatement resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "DeviceUseStatement"
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input
3. Creates a `basedOn` array with a single object containing a `reference` property set to `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license appears to be a combination of AGPL v3 (for Metriport's contributions) and a permissive license (for Microsoft's original work).
3. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a DeviceUseStatement and might be used as part of a larger FHIR resource construction process.
4. The JSON structure is not complete (it's wrapped in extra curly braces), suggesting it might be meant to be included in a larger JSON object.
