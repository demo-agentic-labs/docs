## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource with a reasonReference field. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### DeviceUseStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource with a specific structure, including an id and a reasonReference array.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DeviceUseStatement resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceUseStatement".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field.
4. It creates a `reasonReference` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, populated with the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, the structure of the output suggests it's designed to conform to FHIR specifications for DeviceUseStatement resources.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided correctly.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for a FHIR resource. The resulting JSON object would typically be used as part of a larger FHIR API or data exchange system.
