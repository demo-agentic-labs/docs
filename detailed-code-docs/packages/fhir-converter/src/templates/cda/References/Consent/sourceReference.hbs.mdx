### Consent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object structure for a FHIR Consent resource. It includes the resourceType, id, and sourceReference fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Consent resource |
| REF  | String | The reference value for the sourceReference |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing a FHIR Consent resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Consent"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `sourceReference` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR resources.
3. The generated JSON structure is nested within a "resource" object, suggesting it might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or a wrapper structure used in the conversion process.
4. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests that this might be part of a larger array or object in the final output.
