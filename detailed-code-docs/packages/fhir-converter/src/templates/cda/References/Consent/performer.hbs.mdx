### Consent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Consent resource with a focus on the `performer` field. It's structured to be included as part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Consent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer of the consent |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Consent resource with the `performer` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Consent".
2. It sets the `id` of the Consent resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `performer` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The file includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial Consent resource. In a complete FHIR representation, additional fields would likely be required.
4. The `performer` array is hardcoded to contain only one element. If multiple performers need to be supported, the template would need to be modified.
5. The comma after the `reference` object in the JSON structure might cause issues in strict JSON parsing and may need to be removed in the final output.
