### Consent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Consent resource with a verification element. The verification includes a `verifiedWith` property that references another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Consent resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the resource that verified the consent |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a FHIR Consent resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Consent",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "verification": [
            {
                "verifiedWith": {
                    "reference": "{{REF}}"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Consent".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field of the Consent resource.
3. Within the `verification` array, it creates an object with a `verifiedWith` property.
4. The `verifiedWith` property contains a `reference` field, which is set to the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the output JSON suggests that this template is meant to be part of a larger FHIR resource construction process, as it's wrapped in a "resource" object.
3. The template only populates the `id` and `verification` fields of the Consent resource. Other fields that might be part of a complete Consent resource are not included in this template.
