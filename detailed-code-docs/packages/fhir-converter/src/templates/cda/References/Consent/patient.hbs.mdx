### Consent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Consent resource with a patient reference. It's structured as a JSON object that can be used to generate a FHIR-compliant Consent resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Consent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this consent |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Consent resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Consent",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "patient": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Consent".
2. It sets the `id` of the Consent resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. It includes a `patient` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and requirements for the Consent resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in a path suggesting it's used for CDA to FHIR conversion related to patient consent.
3. The structure adheres to the FHIR Consent resource specifications, focusing on the patient reference aspect of the consent.
4. This template appears to be a partial representation of a Consent resource, as it only includes the `id` and `patient` fields. In a full FHIR Consent resource, additional fields would typically be present.
