### Consent Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Consent resource with an organization reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the organization's reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Consent resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated organization |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR Consent resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the Consent resource
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "Consent"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this Consent resource
  - `organization`: An array containing a single object with a reference to the associated organization

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Consent resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the organization's reference.
3. The `organization` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` property, allowing for linking to the relevant organization resource.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and requirements for the Consent resource |
