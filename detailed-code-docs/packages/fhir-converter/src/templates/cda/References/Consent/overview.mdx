## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR Consent resources with various references. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a different aspect of the Consent resource, such as organization, patient, performer, source reference, and verification.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR Consent resource. They allow for the dynamic generation of JSON structures that represent various aspects of patient consent in a healthcare context. For example:

1. The `organization.hbs` template creates a Consent resource with a reference to an organization.
2. The `patient.hbs` template generates a Consent resource linked to a specific patient.
3. The `performer.hbs` template adds information about who performed or executed the consent.
4. The `sourceReference.hbs` template includes a reference to the source of the consent information.
5. The `verification.verifiedWith.hbs` template adds verification details to the Consent resource.

These templates can be used individually or combined to create a complete FHIR Consent resource, depending on the available data and the specific requirements of the conversion process.

## Key Files
1. `organization.hbs`: Creates a Consent resource with an organization reference.
2. `patient.hbs`: Generates a Consent resource with a patient reference.
3. `performer.hbs`: Adds a performer reference to the Consent resource.
4. `sourceReference.hbs`: Includes a source reference in the Consent resource.
5. `verification.verifiedWith.hbs`: Adds verification details to the Consent resource.

Each of these files follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Consent",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        // Specific fields for each template
    }
}
```

The specific fields vary depending on the purpose of each template. For example:

- `organization.hbs` includes:
  ```handlebars
  "organization": [
      {
          "reference": "{{REF}}"
      }
  ]
  ```

- `patient.hbs` includes:
  ```handlebars
  "patient": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
  }
  ```

## Dependencies
These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system and depend on:

1. Handlebars: The templating engine used to process the templates and insert dynamic values.
2. FHIR Specification: The templates adhere to the FHIR Consent resource structure as defined in the FHIR specification.

## Configuration
While these templates don't have explicit configuration options, they use placeholders that are expected to be filled when the templates are rendered:

- `{{ID}}`: The unique identifier for the Consent resource.
- `{{REF}}`: A reference to another resource (e.g., organization, patient, performer) related to the consent.

These values would typically be provided by the FHIR converter system when processing CDA documents and generating FHIR resources.

## Notes
1. These templates are partial representations of a FHIR Consent resource. In a complete implementation, additional fields and more complex structures might be necessary.
2. The templates are designed to be flexible, allowing for the creation of different aspects of a Consent resource as needed during the conversion process.
3. The use of separate templates for different parts of the Consent resource suggests a modular approach to resource creation, which can enhance maintainability and flexibility in the conversion process.
4. All files include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation, licensed under AGPLv3.
5. The templates are specifically located in a path related to CDA conversions, confirming their role in transforming CDA documents to FHIR format.
