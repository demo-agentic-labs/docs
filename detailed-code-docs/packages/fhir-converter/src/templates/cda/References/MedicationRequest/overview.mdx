## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of FHIR MedicationRequest resources. These templates are designed to be used in a system that converts Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format, specifically focusing on medication-related information.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different components of a FHIR MedicationRequest resource. Each template focuses on a specific field or set of fields within the MedicationRequest structure. When used in combination, they can generate a complete MedicationRequest resource that includes information such as:

- The medication being requested
- The patient for whom the medication is intended
- The healthcare provider requesting the medication
- The reason for the medication request
- Any supporting information or prior prescriptions
- Details about dispensing the medication
- Insurance information related to the medication request

The templates use placeholders (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) that are filled in with actual data when the conversion process runs, allowing for dynamic generation of FHIR resources based on the input CDA data.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Defines the `basedOn` field, which references another request that this medication request is based on.
2. `detectedIssue.hbs`: Specifies any issues detected related to the medication request.
3. `dispenseRequest.performer.hbs`: Defines the performer of the dispense request within the medication request.
4. `encounter.hbs`: Links the medication request to a specific healthcare encounter.
5. `eventHistory.hbs`: Provides a history of events related to the medication request.
6. `insurance.hbs`: Specifies insurance information related to the medication request.
7. `medicationReference.hbs`: References the specific medication being requested.
8. `performer.hbs`: Identifies the person or organization that will fulfill the medication request.
9. `priorPrescription.hbs`: References any prior prescriptions related to this medication request.
10. `reasonReference.hbs`: Provides a reference to the reason for the medication request.
11. `recorder.hbs`: Identifies who recorded the medication request in the system.
12. `reportedReference.hbs`: Specifies who reported the need for the medication.
13. `requester.hbs`: Identifies who is requesting the medication.
14. `subject.hbs`: Specifies the patient for whom the medication is being requested.
15. `supportingInformation.hbs`: Provides references to any supporting information for the medication request.

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to work within a Handlebars templating system, which is commonly used for generating HTML or, in this case, JSON structures. They are part of a larger FHIR conversion framework, likely the fhir-converter package.

## Configuration
While the individual templates don't have specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of input variables (typically `ID` and `REF`). The behavior of each template is determined by the values passed to these variables when the template is rendered.

The templates are meant to be used as part of a larger conversion process, where the appropriate data is fed into each template to build a complete FHIR MedicationRequest resource.

## Notes
1. These templates are part of a copyright-protected work, with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The templates are licensed under AGPLv3, which is important to note for anyone using or modifying this code.
3. Each template generates only a partial MedicationRequest resource, focusing on specific fields. They are designed to be combined to create a complete resource.
4. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that these values are expected to be provided dynamically when the templates are rendered.
5. The templates are structured to allow for easy integration into larger FHIR conversion processes.
