### MedicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with a focus on the `requester` field. It sets up the basic structure of the resource and includes placeholders for the resource ID and the requester's reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the requester of the medication |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the resource type as "MedicationRequest".
2. It sets the resource ID using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `requester` field is populated with a `reference` sub-field, which uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It relies on the correct input of `ID` and `REF` values when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc., licensed under AGPLv3.
3. The template only defines a partial MedicationRequest resource. In a complete FHIR document, this would likely be combined with other templates to form a full resource.
4. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that these values are expected to be provided dynamically when the template is rendered.
