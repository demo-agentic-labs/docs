### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource. The template focuses on the `dispenseRequest.performer` element of the MedicationRequest.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the performer of the dispense request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure representing a FHIR MedicationRequest resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationRequest".
3. The `id` field is populated with the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. Within the `dispenseRequest` object, it defines a `performer` object with a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It relies on the correct usage of the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` placeholders will be properly populated when the template is used.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it generates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource that conforms to the FHIR specification. The relevant part of the FHIR MedicationRequest resource structure it represents is:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "MedicationRequest",
  "id": "&lt;id&gt;",
  "dispenseRequest": {
    "performer": {
      "reference": "&lt;reference&gt;"
    }
  }
}
```

Where `&lt;id&gt;` and `&lt;reference&gt;` would be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.
