### MedicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource structure with an encounter reference. It's likely used as a building block in a larger FHIR document conversion process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with an encounter reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MedicationRequest".
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}`.
3. Includes an `encounter` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger Handlebars-based FHIR conversion system. It depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The structure is fixed, with placeholders for dynamic values.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the ID and encounter reference to be dynamically inserted.
3. This template represents only a partial MedicationRequest resource. In a complete FHIR document, additional fields would likely be required.
4. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which might need to be handled or removed in the final output depending on the JSON parser used.
