## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with a focus on the `performer` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR resource construction process, specifically for mapping CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### MedicationRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource structure with a `performer` field. The `performer` is represented as a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the performer resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the MedicationRequest details
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "MedicationRequest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `performer`: An object containing a reference to the performer

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. The `performer` field is set as an object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work within a Handlebars templating system, which is commonly used for generating HTML or, in this case, JSON structures.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template generates only a partial MedicationRequest resource. In a complete FHIR resource, there would typically be additional fields such as `status`, `intent`, `subject`, and `medicationCodeableConcept` or `medicationReference`.
4. The `performer` in a MedicationRequest typically represents the person or organization that is intended to fulfill the request.

This template serves as a building block in a larger FHIR resource construction process, focusing specifically on setting the performer for a MedicationRequest.
