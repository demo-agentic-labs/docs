## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource structure, specifically focusing on the `detectedIssue` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### MedicationRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationRequest resource, specifically including the `detectedIssue` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the detected issue |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial MedicationRequest resource with the `detectedIssue` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationRequest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
4. The `detectedIssue` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` property.
5. The `reference` property is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`), which allow for dynamic content insertion when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the system that uses this template to render the final JSON output.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure that could be part of a larger API response or data transformation process.
