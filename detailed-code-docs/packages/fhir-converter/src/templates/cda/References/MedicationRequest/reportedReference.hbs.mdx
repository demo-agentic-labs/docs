### MedicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource structure with a `reportedReference` field. The `reportedReference` is used to indicate who reported the medication request, which could be a patient, practitioner, or related person.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the entity who reported the medication request |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicationRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "reportedReference": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's `id` field.
3. The `reportedReference` object is created with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and helper functions to convert CDA documents to FHIR resources.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It's assumed that error handling and validation of input values are managed by the system using this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself but is part of a larger system for converting CDA to FHIR. It expects to be called with appropriate context variables (`ID` and `REF`) set.
