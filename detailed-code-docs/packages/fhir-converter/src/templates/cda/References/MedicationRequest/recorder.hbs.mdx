### MedicationRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource structure with the `recorder` field populated. The `recorder` field typically represents the person who entered the medication request into the system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the recorder of the medication request |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "MedicationRequest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `recorder`: An object containing:
    - `reference`: A reference to the recorder of the medication request

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. The `recorder` field is populated with an object containing a `reference` field, which is set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system and likely depends on:
- Handlebars templating engine
- A FHIR conversion framework (possibly part of the fhir-converter package)

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- This template is part of a copyright-protected work, with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
- The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy integration into larger FHIR conversion processes.
- It only defines a partial MedicationRequest resource, focusing specifically on the `recorder` field. Other parts of the MedicationRequest resource would need to be defined elsewhere for a complete representation.
