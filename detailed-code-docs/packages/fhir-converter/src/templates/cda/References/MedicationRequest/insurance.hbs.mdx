## High-level description

It's designed to be used as part of a larger template system for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### MedicationRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationRequest resource, specifically populating the `id` and `insurance` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurance resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | Object | A partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MedicationRequest".
2. Sets the `id` field using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. Creates an `insurance` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger Handlebars-based templating system used for FHIR conversion.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the larger templating system using this partial.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself but is likely used as part of a larger FHIR conversion API or system.
