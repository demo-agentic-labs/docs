### MedicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource, focusing specifically on the `subject` field. The subject typically refers to the patient for whom the medication is being requested.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject (usually a patient) of the medication request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial MedicationRequest resource with the `subject` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationRequest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` of the resource.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It likely depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a file that includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template only defines a partial resource structure, focusing on the `subject` field. It's likely used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete MedicationRequest resource.
3. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where dynamic values should be inserted when the template is rendered.
