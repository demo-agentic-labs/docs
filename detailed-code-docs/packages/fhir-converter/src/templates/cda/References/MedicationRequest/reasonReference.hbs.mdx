### MedicationRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with a focus on the `reasonReference` field. It provides a structure for linking a medication request to a reason for the prescription, such as a condition or observation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the reason for the medication request |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with the `reasonReference` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure for a FHIR resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationRequest".
3. It uses the provided `ID` to set the resource's `id` field.
4. It creates a `reasonReference` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field is populated with the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of input variables (`ID` and `REF`).

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure suggests this template is meant to be part of a larger conversion process, likely used in conjunction with other templates to build complete FHIR resources.
3. The `reasonReference` is structured as an array, allowing for potential expansion to multiple reasons, although this template only includes one.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be merged with other parts of a MedicationRequest resource during the conversion process.
