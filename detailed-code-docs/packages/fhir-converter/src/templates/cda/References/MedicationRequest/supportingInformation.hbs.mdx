### MedicationRequest Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource with a focus on the `supportingInformation` field. It provides a structure for including references to supporting information for a medication request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR MedicationRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MedicationRequest".
2. It sets the `id` of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. The `supportingInformation` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field is populated with the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is specifically designed for CDA to FHIR conversions. It relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation, indicated by the `{{}}` delimiters.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a MedicationRequest resource, focusing only on the `supportingInformation` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The structure allows for only one supporting information reference. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified or used multiple times.
4. The comma after the `reference` object suggests that this template might be part of a larger structure where additional fields could be added.
