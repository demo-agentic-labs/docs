### VerificationResult Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR VerificationResult resource structure with a primary source. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the VerificationResult resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the primary source entity |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR VerificationResult resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "VerificationResult"
- id: The provided ID
- primarySource: An array containing one object with a "who" field, which includes a reference to the primary source entity

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the resourceType to "VerificationResult".
3. It sets the id using the provided `{{ID}}` value.
4. It creates a primarySource array with one object.
5. Within this object, it sets the "who" field with a reference using the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic values (ID and REF).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON object follows the FHIR VerificationResult resource specifications, focusing specifically on the primarySource element.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of the resource ID and the reference to the primary source entity.
