### VerificationResult Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object for a FHIR VerificationResult resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a target reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the VerificationResult resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the target of the verification |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR VerificationResult resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "VerificationResult"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `target` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure is nested within a `resource` object, which might be part of a larger FHIR bundle or message structure.
3. The `target` field is an array, but this template only includes a single target reference. If multiple targets are needed, the template would need to be modified.
4. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which might need to be removed depending on the JSON parser being used, as some parsers don't allow trailing commas.
