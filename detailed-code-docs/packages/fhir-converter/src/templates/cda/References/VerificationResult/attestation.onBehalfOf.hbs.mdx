## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR VerificationResult resource with an attestation onBehalfOf reference. It's designed to be used in the FHIR Converter project for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### VerificationResult Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a FHIR VerificationResult resource with a focus on the attestation's onBehalfOf property.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the VerificationResult resource |
| REF  | String | The reference value for the onBehalfOf property |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR VerificationResult resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the VerificationResult resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "VerificationResult"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `attestation`: Contains the attestation information
    - `onBehalfOf`: Specifies on whose behalf the attestation is made
      - `reference`: The reference to the entity on whose behalf the attestation is made

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values:
   - `{{ID}}` is used to set the `id` of the VerificationResult resource
   - `{{REF}}` is used to set the `reference` value in the `onBehalfOf` object

2. The structure follows the FHIR VerificationResult resource specification, focusing on the attestation's onBehalfOf property.

3. The template is designed to be part of a larger transformation process, likely used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in the FHIR Converter project for transforming CDA to FHIR.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for `ID` and `REF` when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. Error management would typically be handled by the system using this template, such as checking for the presence of required input values before rendering.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself but is part of the interface used by the FHIR Converter to transform CDA data to FHIR format. It expects to receive values for `ID` and `REF` when rendered.
