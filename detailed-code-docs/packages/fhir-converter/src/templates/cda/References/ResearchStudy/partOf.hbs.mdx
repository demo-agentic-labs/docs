### ResearchStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchStudy resource. It specifically focuses on the 'partOf' relationship, which indicates that this study is part of a larger study or project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this ResearchStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the parent study or project |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR ResearchStudy resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the ResearchStudy details
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "ResearchStudy"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `partOf`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` to the parent study

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a ResearchStudy resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ResearchStudy".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `partOf` array with a single object inside.
5. This object contains a `reference` field, which is set to the `REF` input value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions and disclaimers.
3. The template is part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR format.
4. The 'partOf' relationship in FHIR is used to represent hierarchical or nested relationships between research studies.
