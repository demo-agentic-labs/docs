### ResearchStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchStudy resource, focusing on the site information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the study site |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR ResearchStudy resource with site information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "ResearchStudy"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "site" array with a single object containing a "reference" field
5. The "reference" field is populated with the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the ResearchStudy resource.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and might be part of a larger FHIR resource bundle or message.
4. The site array is hardcoded to contain only one element, which might limit its flexibility if multiple sites need to be represented.
