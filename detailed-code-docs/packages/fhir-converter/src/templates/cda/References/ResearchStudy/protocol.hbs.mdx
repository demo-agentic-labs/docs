### ResearchStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchStudy resource, focusing on the protocol reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the protocol associated with the research study |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR ResearchStudy resource with protocol information |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure with a "resource" object.
2. Within the resource object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" as "ResearchStudy"
   - "id" using the provided {{ID}} input
   - "protocol" as an array containing a single object with a "reference" property set to the provided {{REF}} input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The generated JSON structure follows the FHIR standard for representing a ResearchStudy resource.
3. The protocol is represented as an array, allowing for potential expansion to multiple protocol references if needed in the future.
