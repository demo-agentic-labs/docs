### ResearchStudy Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR ResearchStudy resource with a focus on the sponsor field. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and sponsor reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the sponsor of the research study |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR ResearchStudy resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ResearchStudy",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "sponsor": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR ResearchStudy resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to allow dynamic insertion of values for the resource ID and sponsor reference.
3. The `resourceType` is hardcoded as "ResearchStudy".
4. The `sponsor` field is populated with a reference object containing the provided reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in the FHIR Converter project for transforming different healthcare data formats into FHIR resources.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial ResearchStudy resource, focusing on the sponsor field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to create a complete FHIR ResearchStudy resource.
4. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that this template is designed to be populated with dynamic data during the conversion process.
