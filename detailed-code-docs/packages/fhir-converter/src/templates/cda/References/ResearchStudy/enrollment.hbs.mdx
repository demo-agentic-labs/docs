### ResearchStudy Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ResearchStudy resource with an enrollment reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and enrollment reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the enrollment resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | Object | A FHIR-compliant ResearchStudy resource with enrollment information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FHIR ResearchStudy resource structure
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "ResearchStudy"
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the resource's `id` field
4. Creates an `enrollment` array with a single object containing a `reference` field
5. Inserts the provided `REF` value into the `reference` field of the enrollment object

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) which should be replaced with actual values when the template is processed.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the Microsoft portion is provided under a more permissive license.
3. The template is specifically designed for the CDA to FHIR conversion process, focusing on the ResearchStudy resource type.
4. The structure of the output JSON is nested, with the actual ResearchStudy resource contained within a "resource" object. This nesting might be required by the larger conversion system this template is part of.
