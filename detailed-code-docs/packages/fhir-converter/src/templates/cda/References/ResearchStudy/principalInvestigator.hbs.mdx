### ResearchStudy Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR ResearchStudy resource with a principalInvestigator reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the principal investigator's reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ResearchStudy resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the principal investigator |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR ResearchStudy resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ResearchStudy",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "principalInvestigator": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a FHIR ResearchStudy resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "ResearchStudy".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the resource's `id`.
4. It creates a `principalInvestigator` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and conversion logic. It depends on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The values for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it generates a part of a FHIR API response. The generated JSON structure conforms to the FHIR ResearchStudy resource specification, specifically focusing on the `principalInvestigator` field.
