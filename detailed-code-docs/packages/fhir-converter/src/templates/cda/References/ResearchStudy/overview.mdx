## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR ResearchStudy resources with various references. These templates are part of the FHIR Converter project, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of a ResearchStudy resource, such as enrollment, principal investigator, protocol, site, and sponsor.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR ResearchStudy resource. They allow for the dynamic generation of JSON structures that represent various aspects of a research study, including:

1. Enrollment information
2. Part-of relationships (indicating if a study is part of a larger study)
3. Principal investigator details
4. Study protocol references
5. Study site information
6. Sponsor details

When used in the conversion process, these templates take input data (typically from CDA documents) and transform it into FHIR-compliant JSON structures. This enables interoperability between different healthcare systems and facilitates the exchange of research study information in a standardized format.

## Key Files
1. `enrollment.hbs`: Creates a ResearchStudy resource with an enrollment reference.
2. `partOf.hbs`: Generates a ResearchStudy resource indicating it's part of a larger study.
3. `principalInvestigator.hbs`: Produces a ResearchStudy resource with a principal investigator reference.
4. `protocol.hbs`: Creates a ResearchStudy resource with a protocol reference.
5. `site.hbs`: Generates a ResearchStudy resource with a site reference.
6. `sponsor.hbs`: Produces a ResearchStudy resource with a sponsor reference.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ResearchStudy",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "specificField": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

Where `specificField` is replaced by the relevant field (e.g., enrollment, partOf, principalInvestigator, etc.) and `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are placeholders for dynamic values.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to work within the larger FHIR Converter project, which likely provides the necessary context and data for rendering these templates.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders. The main configurable elements are:

1. `{{ID}}`: The unique identifier for the ResearchStudy resource.
2. `{{REF}}`: The reference to the specific entity (e.g., enrollment, principal investigator, protocol) associated with the study.

These values are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered as part of the CDA to FHIR conversion process.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates generate partial FHIR ResearchStudy resources, each focusing on a specific aspect. They are likely meant to be combined or used selectively to create complete FHIR ResearchStudy resources based on the available CDA data.
3. The use of a consistent structure across all templates suggests a modular approach to building FHIR resources, allowing for easy maintenance and extension of the conversion process.
4. While these templates provide a foundation for creating ResearchStudy resources, additional logic may be required in the broader conversion system to handle data validation, error checking, and combining these partial resources into complete FHIR documents.
