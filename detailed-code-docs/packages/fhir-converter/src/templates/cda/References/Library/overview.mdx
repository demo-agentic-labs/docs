### Library Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Library resource. It includes a resource type, an ID, and a subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Library resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject of the Library |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Library resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Library"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `subjectReference` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the Library resource |
| REF | string | The reference for the subject of the Library |

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from multiple parties.
- The output is a JSON structure, which could be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle.
- The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and subject references to be passed in for each use.
