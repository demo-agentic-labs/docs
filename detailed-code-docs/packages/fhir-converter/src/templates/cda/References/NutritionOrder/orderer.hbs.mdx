## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR NutritionOrder resource structure, specifically focusing on the `orderer` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR NutritionOrder resource, with emphasis on the `orderer` field. The template uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the NutritionOrder resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the orderer of the nutrition order |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR NutritionOrder resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "NutritionOrder",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "orderer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR NutritionOrder resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "NutritionOrder".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates an `orderer` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It likely depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the `orderer` field of a NutritionOrder resource, suggesting it's part of a modular approach to building FHIR resources.
3. The JSON structure is partial, indicated by the comma at the end of the `resource` object, implying that this template might be combined with other templates to form a complete FHIR resource.
