### NutritionOrder Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR NutritionOrder resource with an encounter reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the NutritionOrder resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR NutritionOrder resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "NutritionOrder"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates an "encounter" object with a "reference" property, using the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses standard Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a NutritionOrder resource, focusing specifically on the encounter reference. It may be used as part of a larger template or system for generating complete FHIR resources.
3. The JSON structure is not closed, suggesting that this template might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a more complete NutritionOrder resource or a larger FHIR bundle.
