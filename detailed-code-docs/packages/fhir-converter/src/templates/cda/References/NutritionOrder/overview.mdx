## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR NutritionOrder resources. These templates focus on specific aspects of a NutritionOrder, such as allergyIntolerance, encounter, orderer, and patient references. They are designed to be used as part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR NutritionOrder resource. Each template focuses on a specific reference within the NutritionOrder:

1. allergyIntolerance.hbs: Creates a reference to an AllergyIntolerance resource.
2. encounter.hbs: Establishes a link to an associated Encounter resource.
3. orderer.hbs: Specifies the healthcare provider who ordered the nutrition plan.
4. patient.hbs: Links the NutritionOrder to a specific patient.

When used in combination, these templates can generate a complete NutritionOrder resource that includes all necessary references. This modular approach allows for flexibility in creating FHIR resources based on the available CDA data.

## Key Files
1. allergyIntolerance.hbs:
   - Creates a NutritionOrder resource with an allergyIntolerance reference.
   - Inputs: ID (resource identifier) and REF (reference to AllergyIntolerance).
   - Output: JSON object with resourceType, id, and allergyIntolerance array.

2. encounter.hbs:
   - Generates a NutritionOrder resource with an encounter reference.
   - Inputs: ID (resource identifier) and REF (reference to Encounter).
   - Output: JSON object with resourceType, id, and encounter object.

3. orderer.hbs:
   - Produces a NutritionOrder resource with an orderer reference.
   - Inputs: ID (resource identifier) and REF (reference to orderer).
   - Output: JSON object with resourceType, id, and orderer object.

4. patient.hbs:
   - Creates a NutritionOrder resource with a patient reference.
   - Inputs: ID (resource identifier) and REF (reference to Patient).
   - Output: JSON object with resourceType, id, and patient object.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are part of the FHIR Converter project, which is likely responsible for providing the necessary context and data for rendering these templates.

## Configuration
These templates don't include specific configuration options. They use standard Handlebars syntax for variable substitution, with placeholders for ID and REF values. The behavior of each template is determined by the values passed to these placeholders when rendered.

Example usage:
```handlebars
{{&gt; NutritionOrder/patient ID="12345" REF="Patient/67890"}}
```

This would generate:
```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "NutritionOrder",
    "id": "12345",
    "patient": {
      "reference": "Patient/67890"
    }
  }
}
```

It's important to note that these templates generate partial JSON structures, which are likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to create complete FHIR resources or bundles.

The modular nature of these templates allows for easy maintenance and updates to specific parts of the NutritionOrder resource without affecting the entire structure. This approach also provides flexibility in generating FHIR resources based on the available CDA data, as different combinations of these templates can be used depending on the information present in the source document.
