### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is the main (and only) template in the file. It creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR NutritionOrder resource, with emphasis on the patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the NutritionOrder resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this NutritionOrder |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | Object | A partial FHIR NutritionOrder resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" as "NutritionOrder"
   - "id" using the provided `{{ID}}` input
   - "patient" object with a "reference" property set to the provided `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template generates only a partial FHIR NutritionOrder resource, focusing solely on the patient reference. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates to create a complete NutritionOrder resource.
3. The structure uses double curly braces `{{}}` for Handlebars variable interpolation.
4. The output is not a complete JSON object, suggesting it's meant to be embedded within a larger JSON structure.
