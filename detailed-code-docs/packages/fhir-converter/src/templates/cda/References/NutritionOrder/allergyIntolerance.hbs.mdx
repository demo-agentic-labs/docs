### NutritionOrder Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR NutritionOrder resource with an allergyIntolerance reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the NutritionOrder resource |
| REF | String | The reference to an AllergyIntolerance resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant NutritionOrder resource with allergyIntolerance reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a "resource" object with "resourceType" set to "NutritionOrder"
2. Sets the "id" of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input
3. Creates an "allergyIntolerance" array with a single object containing a "reference" field
4. Sets the "reference" field using the provided `{{REF}}` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The structure is fixed, and the only customizable parts are the ID and reference values.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather creates a data structure that could be used as part of a FHIR API response or request body.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resource.resourceType | String | Always set to "NutritionOrder" |
| resource.id | String | Unique identifier for the NutritionOrder |
| resource.allergyIntolerance[0].reference | String | Reference to an AllergyIntolerance resource |
