### EffectEvidenceSynthesis Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource, with a focus on the `resultsByExposure` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "EffectEvidenceSynthesis".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field.
4. In the `resultsByExposure` array, it creates an object with a `riskEvidenceSynthesis` property.
5. The `riskEvidenceSynthesis` object contains a `reference` field, which is set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license appears to be a combination of AGPL v3 (for Metriport's contributions) and a permissive license (for Microsoft's contributions).
3. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR format.
4. The structure follows the FHIR specification for EffectEvidenceSynthesis resources, focusing on the `resultsByExposure` element.
5. The template only populates a minimal set of fields. In a real-world scenario, there might be additional fields that could be included in the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource.
