## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource with an exposureAlternative reference. The template is designed to create a JSON structure representing this resource.

### EffectEvidenceSynthesis Template
#### Description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource in FHIR format. It specifically focuses on the exposureAlternative field of the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the exposureAlternative |

#### Outputs
The template generates a JSON object representing an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "EffectEvidenceSynthesis",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "exposureAlternative": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "EffectEvidenceSynthesis".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's id.
4. It creates an `exposureAlternative` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template does not define an API. It is meant to be used as part of a larger system that handles FHIR resource generation.
