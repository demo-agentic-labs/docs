### EffectEvidenceSynthesis Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object for an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource, focusing on the exposure field. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and exposure reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the exposure field |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing part of an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "EffectEvidenceSynthesis".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field.
4. It creates an `exposure` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR resource generation system.
