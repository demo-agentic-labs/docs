## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various components of an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory work together to create different parts of an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource, which is used in FHIR to represent a synthesis of evidence about the effects of exposures on outcomes. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource:

1. The exposure template defines the exposure being studied.
2. The exposureAlternative template specifies an alternative exposure for comparison.
3. The outcome template describes the outcome being measured.
4. The population template defines the population involved in the study.
5. The resultsByExposure template links to a RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource that contains the results of the study.

When used in combination, these templates allow for the creation of a comprehensive EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource that can be used in healthcare systems to represent synthesized evidence about the effects of various exposures on health outcomes.

## Key Files
1. `exposure.hbs`: Generates the exposure field of the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource.
2. `exposureAlternative.hbs`: Creates the exposureAlternative field of the resource.
3. `outcome.hbs`: Produces the outcome field of the resource.
4. `population.hbs`: Generates the population field of the resource.
5. `resultsByExposure.riskEvidenceSynthesis.hbs`: Creates the resultsByExposure field, linking to a RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, creating a JSON object that represents a part of the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource. They all use Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and specific references.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output. They are designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR resource generation system, likely within a FHIR converter framework.

## Configuration
While these templates don't include specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible. Each template expects certain inputs (typically an ID and a reference) that should be provided when the template is rendered. This allows for dynamic generation of FHIR resources based on the input data.

In summary, this directory contains a set of templates that work together to generate different components of an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource in FHIR format. These templates are part of a larger system designed to convert CDA documents to FHIR format, providing a flexible and modular approach to FHIR resource generation.
