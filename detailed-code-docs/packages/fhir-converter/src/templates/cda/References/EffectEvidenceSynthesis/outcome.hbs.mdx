### EffectEvidenceSynthesis Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object for an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource, focusing on the outcome reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and outcome reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the outcome resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing part of an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "EffectEvidenceSynthesis".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the resource's `id`.
4. It creates an `outcome` object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for generating part of a FHIR EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource. It expects to be used within a larger system that can provide the necessary context and input values.
