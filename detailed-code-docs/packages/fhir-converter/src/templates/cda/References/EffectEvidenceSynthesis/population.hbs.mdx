## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for creating an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource in FHIR format. It specifically focuses on the population reference within the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource.

### EffectEvidenceSynthesis Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource, which is part of the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. The template specifically defines the population reference for the EffectEvidenceSynthesis.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the population resource |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "EffectEvidenceSynthesis",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "population": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "EffectEvidenceSynthesis".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
3. The `population` field is defined with a `reference` subfield, which uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses two placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) that should be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR format.
2. The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice that covers both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation, indicating shared or derived work.
3. The template focuses solely on the population reference of an EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource. Other properties of the EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource are not included in this template.
4. The JSON structure is not complete (note the trailing commas), suggesting that this template might be combined with others to form a complete FHIR resource.
