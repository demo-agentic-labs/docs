## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a FHIR Schedule resource with an actor reference. It's designed to generate a JSON structure representing a Schedule resource in the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard.

### Schedule Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Schedule resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an actor reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Schedule resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the actor associated with this schedule |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Schedule resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Schedule"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `actor` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the Schedule resource.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template generates a partial FHIR resource structure. It may be part of a larger system that combines multiple such partial resources to create complete FHIR documents.
3. The JSON structure is not complete (it has trailing commas and is wrapped in extra curly braces), suggesting it might be meant to be embedded within a larger JSON structure.
