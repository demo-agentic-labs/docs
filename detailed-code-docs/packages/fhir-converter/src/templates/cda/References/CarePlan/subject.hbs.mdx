### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CarePlan resource with a subject reference. The CarePlan is a key resource in FHIR that describes the intention of how one or more practitioners intend to deliver care for a particular patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject (typically a patient) of the care plan |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CarePlan",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CarePlan".
2. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the CarePlan resource.
3. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and content of the CarePlan resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API itself, this template contributes to creating a FHIR-compliant CarePlan resource. The resulting JSON should conform to the FHIR CarePlan resource specification.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | String | Always "CarePlan" for this resource |
| id | String | Unique identifier for this CarePlan instance |
| subject.reference | String | Reference to the subject (usually a patient) of the care plan |

Note: This template appears to be a partial representation of a CarePlan resource, focusing specifically on the `id` and `subject` fields. A complete CarePlan resource would typically include additional fields such as `status`, `intent`, `category`, and others as defined in the FHIR specification.
