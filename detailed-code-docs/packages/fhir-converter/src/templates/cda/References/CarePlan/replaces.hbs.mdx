### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR CarePlan resource. It specifically focuses on the 'replaces' field, which indicates that this CarePlan replaces another plan.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for this CarePlan resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the CarePlan that this plan replaces |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CarePlan",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "replaces": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CarePlan".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the CarePlan.
3. In the `replaces` array, it adds an object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions as stated in the notice.
3. The structure of the JSON suggests that this template might be part of a larger system for generating FHIR resources, possibly used in a healthcare information exchange context.
