### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CarePlan resource with an encounter reference. It's a partial template that would likely be included in a larger FHIR bundle or resource structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR CarePlan resource with an encounter reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "CarePlan".
2. It sets the `id` of the CarePlan using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. It includes an `encounter` object with a `reference` field set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON output |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and content of the CarePlan resource |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in a directory structure suggesting it's used for CDA to FHIR conversion, specifically for CarePlan resources.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and would likely be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle.
4. The template uses Handlebars syntax (`{{}}`) for variable interpolation.

This template serves as a building block in a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically handling the encounter reference within a CarePlan resource. It would be used in conjunction with other templates and logic to build complete FHIR resources from CDA documents.
