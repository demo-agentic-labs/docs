### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CarePlan resource with a `basedOn` property, which indicates that this care plan is derived from or based on another plan or protocol.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for this CarePlan resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the plan or protocol this CarePlan is based on |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CarePlan",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "basedOn": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a CarePlan resource with a fixed `resourceType` of "CarePlan".
2. It sets the `id` of the CarePlan using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. It includes a `basedOn` array with a single element, containing a `reference` to the plan or protocol this CarePlan is based on, using the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that valid values will be provided for ID and REF. If these values are not provided or are invalid, it may result in an invalid or incomplete FHIR resource.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it generates a part of a FHIR CarePlan resource, which adheres to the FHIR specification. The generated JSON can be used as part of a FHIR API request or response.
