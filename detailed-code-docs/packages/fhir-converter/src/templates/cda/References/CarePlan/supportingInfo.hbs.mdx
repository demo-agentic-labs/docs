## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR CarePlan resource structure, specifically focusing on the `supportingInfo` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CarePlan resource with a focus on the `supportingInfo` field. It provides a structure for including references to supporting information for a care plan.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR CarePlan resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "CarePlan".
2. It sets the `id` of the CarePlan using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. The `supportingInfo` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field is populated with the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars variables (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`).

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.
2. The structure is a partial representation of a CarePlan resource, focusing only on the `supportingInfo` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete CarePlan resource.
3. The template allows for only one supporting information reference. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified or used multiple times.
4. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which might need to be handled or removed depending on how the template is processed or used.
