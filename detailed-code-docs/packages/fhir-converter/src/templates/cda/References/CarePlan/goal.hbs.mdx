### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CarePlan resource with a single goal reference. The CarePlan is a minimal representation, containing only the resourceType, id, and a goal reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the goal associated with this CarePlan |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the CarePlan details
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "CarePlan"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the CarePlan
  - `goal`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CarePlan".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the CarePlan.
3. It creates a `goal` array with a single object containing a `reference` property, which is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR converters for transforming different healthcare data formats into FHIR resources.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is minimal and focused solely on creating a CarePlan resource with a goal reference. It doesn't include other potential properties of a CarePlan resource, suggesting it might be used in conjunction with other templates or as part of a larger conversion process.
3. The use of Handlebars placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that this template is meant to be populated with data during the conversion process.
