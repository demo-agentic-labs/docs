## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR CarePlan resource with a 'partOf' reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR resource construction process, specifically for creating a CarePlan that is part of another CarePlan.

### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CarePlan resource with a 'partOf' reference. It's structured to be included in a larger FHIR resource bundle.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for this CarePlan resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the parent CarePlan |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR CarePlan resource with the 'partOf' field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a 'resource' key.
2. Inside the 'resource' object, it sets:
   - 'resourceType' to "CarePlan"
   - 'id' to the provided {{ID}}
   - 'partOf' as an array with a single object containing a 'reference' to the provided {{REF}}

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required variables (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now part of the Metriport Inc. project.
2. The template is designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for easy integration into larger FHIR resource construction processes.
3. The 'partOf' field is an array, suggesting that a CarePlan could potentially be part of multiple other CarePlans, although this template only includes one reference.
4. The comma after the reference object in the 'partOf' array and after the 'partOf' field itself might cause issues in strict JSON parsing and should be removed for valid JSON.
