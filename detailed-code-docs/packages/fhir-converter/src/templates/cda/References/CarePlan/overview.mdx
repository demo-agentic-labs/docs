## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR CarePlan resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR CarePlan resource. A CarePlan in FHIR represents a healthcare plan for a patient, including details about activities, goals, and the care team involved. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various components of a CarePlan, such as:

1. Activities and their outcomes
2. References to other resources the CarePlan is based on or addresses
3. Authors and contributors of the CarePlan
4. Associated care teams and encounters
5. Goals of the CarePlan
6. Relationships to other CarePlans (e.g., being part of or replacing another plan)
7. The subject of the CarePlan (typically a patient)
8. Supporting information for the CarePlan

Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the CarePlan, allowing for flexible and modular construction of the resource.

## Key Files
1. `activity.outcomeReference.hbs`: Creates a CarePlan with an activity outcome reference.
2. `activity.reference.hbs`: Generates a CarePlan with an activity reference.
3. `addresses.hbs`: Produces a CarePlan that addresses a specific condition or problem.
4. `author.hbs`: Creates a CarePlan with an author reference.
5. `basedOn.hbs`: Generates a CarePlan based on another plan or protocol.
6. `careTeam.hbs`: Produces a CarePlan with a reference to a care team.
7. `contributor.hbs`: Creates a CarePlan with a contributor reference.
8. `encounter.hbs`: Generates a CarePlan associated with a specific encounter.
9. `goal.hbs`: Produces a CarePlan with a goal reference.
10. `partOf.hbs`: Creates a CarePlan that is part of another CarePlan.
11. `replaces.hbs`: Generates a CarePlan that replaces another plan.
12. `subject.hbs`: Produces a CarePlan with a subject reference.
13. `supportingInfo.hbs`: Creates a CarePlan with supporting information references.

Each of these templates generates a partial JSON structure representing a specific aspect of a FHIR CarePlan resource. They are designed to be used together to build complete CarePlan resources as part of the CDA to FHIR conversion process.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are part of a larger FHIR conversion system and adhere to the FHIR specification for CarePlan resources.

## Configuration
The templates use Handlebars placeholders (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) for dynamic content insertion. These placeholders are expected to be populated with appropriate values when the templates are rendered as part of the conversion process.

While there are no explicit configuration files, the behavior of these templates can be customized by providing different values for the placeholders when rendering.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates are designed to be modular and flexible, allowing for the creation of various CarePlan structures depending on the needs of the conversion process.
3. Some templates may produce JSON structures with trailing commas, which might need to be handled in the final output processing to ensure valid JSON.
4. These templates represent partial CarePlan resources and are likely meant to be combined with other data or templates to form complete FHIR resources.
5. The modular nature of these templates allows for easy maintenance and updates to specific aspects of CarePlan resource generation without affecting the entire conversion process.
