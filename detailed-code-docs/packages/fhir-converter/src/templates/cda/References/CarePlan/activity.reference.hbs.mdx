### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CarePlan resource with an activity reference. It's structured to include the resource type, an ID, and an activity array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the activity associated with this CarePlan |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the CarePlan resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "CarePlan"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this CarePlan
  - `activity`: An array containing a single object with a reference
    - `reference`: An object containing the reference to the associated activity

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CarePlan".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the CarePlan.
3. In the `activity` array, it creates a single object with a `reference` property.
4. The `reference` property uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder to set the reference to the associated activity.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
