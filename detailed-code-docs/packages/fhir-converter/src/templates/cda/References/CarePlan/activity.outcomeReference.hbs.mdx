### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CarePlan resource with a specific structure for the `activity.outcomeReference` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the outcome reference |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "CarePlan"
  - `id`: Set to the provided `{{ID}}`
  - `activity`: An array with a single object containing:
    - `outcomeReference`: An array with a single object containing:
      - `reference`: Set to the provided `{{REF}}`

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets up the basic structure of a FHIR CarePlan resource.
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the unique identifier for the CarePlan.
3. Within the `activity` array, it defines a single activity object.
4. Inside the activity object, it creates an `outcomeReference` array with a single reference object.
5. The `reference` field of the outcome reference is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that valid values will be provided for the `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders. If these values are not provided or are invalid, it may result in an improperly formatted or incomplete JSON output.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, as indicated by the copyright notice at the top of the file.
2. The template is specifically designed for the CarePlan resource and focuses on the `activity.outcomeReference` field, which is used to reference the outcome of a care plan activity.
3. The structure allows for only one activity and one outcome reference. If multiple activities or outcome references are needed, the template would need to be modified or used in conjunction with other templates.
