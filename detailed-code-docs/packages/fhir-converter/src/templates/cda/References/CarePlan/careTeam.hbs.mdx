### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR CarePlan resource with a careTeam reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the careTeam reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the careTeam associated with this CarePlan |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the CarePlan resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "CarePlan"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this CarePlan
  - `careTeam`: An array containing a single object with a reference to the associated careTeam

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR CarePlan resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "CarePlan".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to insert the provided ID for the resource.
4. It creates a `careTeam` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. The `{{REF}}` placeholder is used to insert the provided reference to the careTeam.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR conversion processes.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The structure of the output JSON suggests that this template is meant to be part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource collection, as it's wrapped in a `resource` object.
- The careTeam array is hardcoded to contain only one reference, which might limit its flexibility if multiple care team references are needed.
