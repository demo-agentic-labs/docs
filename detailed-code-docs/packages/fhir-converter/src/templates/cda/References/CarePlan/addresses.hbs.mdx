### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR CarePlan resource. It includes an "addresses" field that references another resource, likely a condition or problem that the care plan is intended to address.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the resource being addressed by this CarePlan |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CarePlan",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "addresses": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CarePlan".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the CarePlan's unique identifier.
3. In the `addresses` array, it includes a single object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID     | String | The identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF    | String | The reference to the addressed resource |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a FHIR converter, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The `addresses` field in a CarePlan typically refers to the health issues, conditions, or problems that the care plan is designed to address.
4. This template creates a minimal CarePlan resource structure. In a full FHIR CarePlan, there would likely be additional fields such as `status`, `intent`, `subject`, and others.
