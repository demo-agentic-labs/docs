### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR CarePlan resource, focusing on the contributor field. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and contributor reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the contributor of the CarePlan |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR CarePlan resource with the following fields:
- resourceType: Always set to "CarePlan"
- id: The unique identifier for the CarePlan
- contributor: An array containing a single object with a reference to the contributor

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the resourceType to "CarePlan".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the id of the CarePlan.
4. In the contributor array, it creates an object with a "reference" field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure with the provided variables.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed for the ID and REF placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The JSON structure is not complete and seems to be a part of a larger FHIR resource representation. It only includes the contributor field of a CarePlan resource.
3. The template allows for only one contributor to be added. If multiple contributors are needed, the template would need to be modified.
4. The trailing commas in the JSON structure might cause issues with strict JSON parsers. They should be removed in the final rendered output if strict JSON compliance is required.
