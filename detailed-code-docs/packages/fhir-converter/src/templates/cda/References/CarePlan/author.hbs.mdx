### CarePlan Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CarePlan resource with an `author` field. The CarePlan resource is used in FHIR to represent a healthcare plan for a patient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the CarePlan resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the author of the CarePlan |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR CarePlan resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CarePlan",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "author": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CarePlan".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the CarePlan.
3. The `author` field is populated with a `reference` object, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template focuses only on the `author` field of a CarePlan resource, suggesting it's meant to be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete CarePlan resource.
