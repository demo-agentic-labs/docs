### SupplyRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR SupplyRequest resource with an itemReference. The SupplyRequest is a request for supply of a particular item, such as a medication or a device.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the SupplyRequest resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the item being requested |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR SupplyRequest resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the SupplyRequest details
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "SupplyRequest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this SupplyRequest
  - `itemReference`: An object containing a reference to the requested item
    - `reference`: The actual reference string to the item

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders in the template will be replaced with the actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in JavaScript applications for generating HTML or other text-based formats.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The template expects the `ID` and `REF` values to be provided when it's rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It's assumed that the calling code will provide valid `ID` and `REF` values.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for use in a FHIR converter, likely as part of a system that transforms CDA documents into FHIR resources.
3. The structure of the output JSON aligns with the FHIR SupplyRequest resource specification, focusing specifically on the `itemReference` element.
4. This template appears to be a small part of a larger system, likely used in conjunction with other templates and processing logic to convert complex medical documents into FHIR-compliant resources.
