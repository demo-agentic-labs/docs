### SupplyRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR SupplyRequest resource. It includes an ID and a supplier reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the SupplyRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supplier |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SupplyRequest resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "SupplyRequest"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "supplier" array with a single object containing a "reference" field
5. Sets the "reference" field to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for ID and REF.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.
