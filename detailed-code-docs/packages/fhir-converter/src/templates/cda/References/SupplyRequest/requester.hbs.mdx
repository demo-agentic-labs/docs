## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR SupplyRequest resource structure, specifically focusing on the `requester` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### SupplyRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR SupplyRequest resource with a focus on the `requester` field. It sets up the basic structure of a SupplyRequest resource and populates the `id` and `requester` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the SupplyRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the requester of the supply |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR SupplyRequest resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "SupplyRequest".
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. Defines a `requester` object within the resource.
4. Sets the `reference` of the requester using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the provided input variables (ID and REF) to populate the resource fields.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `id` and `requester.reference` to be dynamically set based on the input data.
3. This template represents only a partial SupplyRequest resource. In a complete FHIR resource, additional fields would likely be required.
4. The use of Handlebars (indicated by the `{{}}` syntax) suggests that this template is meant to be processed by a Handlebars template engine, likely as part of a larger data transformation pipeline.
