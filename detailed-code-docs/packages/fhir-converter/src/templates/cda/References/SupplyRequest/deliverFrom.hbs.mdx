### SupplyRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR SupplyRequest resource JSON structure. It specifically populates the `deliverFrom` field, which indicates the origin of the supply delivery.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the SupplyRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location or organization from which the supply should be delivered |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR SupplyRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "SupplyRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "deliverFrom": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "SupplyRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the SupplyRequest.
3. The `deliverFrom` field is populated with a `reference` sub-field, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license appears to be a combination of AGPL v3 (for Metriport's contributions) and a permissive license (for Microsoft's original work).
3. The template is specifically designed for the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure.
