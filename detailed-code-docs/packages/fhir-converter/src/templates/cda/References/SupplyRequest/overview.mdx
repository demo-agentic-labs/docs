## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR SupplyRequest resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or component of a SupplyRequest resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR SupplyRequest resource. A SupplyRequest is used in healthcare systems to request supplies, such as medications or medical devices. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various components of a SupplyRequest, including:

1. The delivery origin (deliverFrom)
2. The delivery destination (deliverTo)
3. The item being requested (itemReference)
4. The reason for the request (reasonReference)
5. The person or entity making the request (requester)
6. The supplier of the requested item (supplier)

By using these templates, developers can generate JSON structures that conform to the FHIR SupplyRequest resource specification. This enables the conversion of CDA documents into FHIR-compliant data, facilitating interoperability between different healthcare systems.

## Key Files
1. `deliverFrom.hbs`: Generates the `deliverFrom` field of a SupplyRequest, indicating the origin of the supply delivery.
2. `deliverTo.hbs`: Creates the `deliverTo` field, specifying the destination for the supply delivery.
3. `itemReference.hbs`: Produces the `itemReference` field, referencing the item being requested.
4. `reasonReference.hbs`: Generates the `reasonReference` field, providing a reason for the supply request.
5. `requester.hbs`: Creates the `requester` field, identifying who is making the supply request.
6. `supplier.hbs`: Produces the `supplier` field, referencing the entity supplying the requested item.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "SupplyRequest",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "specificField": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
}
```

Where `specificField` is replaced by the relevant field name (e.g., `deliverFrom`, `deliverTo`, etc.), and `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are placeholders for dynamic values to be inserted when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, likely alongside other templates and processing logic.

## Configuration
The templates themselves do not include specific configuration options. They expect two main inputs:

1. `ID`: A unique identifier for the SupplyRequest resource.
2. `REF`: A reference value specific to each template's purpose (e.g., a reference to the delivery location, requested item, or requester).

These inputs are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered as part of the conversion process.

In conclusion, this directory contains a set of modular templates that work together to create different components of FHIR SupplyRequest resources. These templates play a crucial role in converting CDA documents to FHIR format, enabling better interoperability in healthcare information systems.
