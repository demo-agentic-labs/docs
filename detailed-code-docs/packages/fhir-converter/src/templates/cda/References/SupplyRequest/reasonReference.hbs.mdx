### SupplyRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR SupplyRequest resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a reasonReference array with a single reference object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the SupplyRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the reasonReference |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SupplyRequest resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resourceType to "SupplyRequest"
2. Assigns the provided ID to the resource
3. Creates a reasonReference array with a single object containing a reference field
4. The reference field is populated with the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the SupplyRequest resource.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template is designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format to FHIR.
3. The reasonReference is structured as an array, allowing for potential expansion to multiple references, although this template only includes one.
4. The JSON structure includes nested "resource" and "reasonReference" objects, suggesting it might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
