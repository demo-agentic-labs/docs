### MedicinalProductIndication Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicinalProductIndication resource, focusing on the undesirableEffect field. It provides a basic skeleton for the resource with placeholders for ID and reference values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the MedicinalProductIndication resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the undesirableEffect |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicinalProductIndication resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "MedicinalProductIndication".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's "id" field.
4. The "undesirableEffect" field is an array containing a single object with a "reference" field.
5. The `{{REF}}` placeholder is used for the "reference" value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The structure is fixed, with placeholders for variable data.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from multiple parties (Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation).
2. The template is designed to be minimal, providing only the basic structure for a MedicinalProductIndication resource with an undesirableEffect reference.
3. The generated JSON structure is not complete and would likely need additional fields and data to be a fully valid FHIR resource in most use cases.
4. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for Handlebars placeholders, indicating where dynamic values should be inserted.

This template serves as a starting point for generating MedicinalProductIndication resources with undesirable effects in a FHIR-compliant format, but would need to be expanded with more fields and logic for most practical applications.
