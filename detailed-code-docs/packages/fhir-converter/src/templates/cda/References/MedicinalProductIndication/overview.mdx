## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicinalProductIndication resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. The templates focus on specific aspects of the MedicinalProductIndication resource, including other therapy, subject, and undesirable effects.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a MedicinalProductIndication resource in FHIR format. They allow for the conversion of clinical data related to medicinal product indications into a standardized FHIR format. This standardization enables better interoperability and data exchange between different healthcare systems and applications.

Each template generates a specific part of the MedicinalProductIndication resource:
1. The otherTherapy template creates a structure for referencing medications used as other therapies.
2. The subject template generates a reference to the subject (patient or group) for whom the indication applies.
3. The undesirableEffect template creates a structure for referencing undesirable effects associated with the medicinal product indication.

These templates can be used individually or combined to create a complete MedicinalProductIndication resource, depending on the available data and specific use case.

## Key Files

1. `otherTherapy.medicationReference.hbs`:
   This template generates the structure for the `otherTherapy` field in the MedicinalProductIndication resource. It specifically creates a medication reference within the `otherTherapy` array.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "MedicinalProductIndication",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "otherTherapy": [
         {
           "medicationReference": {
             "reference": "{{REF}}"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. `subject.hbs`:
   This template creates the structure for the `subject` field in the MedicinalProductIndication resource. It generates an array of subject references, typically linking the indication to a specific patient or group.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "MedicinalProductIndication",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "subject": [
         {
           "reference": "{{REF}}"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. `undesirableEffect.hbs`:
   This template generates the structure for the `undesirableEffect` field in the MedicinalProductIndication resource. It creates an array of references to undesirable effects associated with the medicinal product indication.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "MedicinalProductIndication",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "undesirableEffect": [
         {
           "reference": "{{REF}}"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are designed to work within the context of a larger FHIR converter system, which would provide the necessary input data and handle the template rendering process.

The templates adhere to the FHIR specification, which defines the structure and content of the MedicinalProductIndication resource. Therefore, the FHIR specification itself can be considered a key dependency for the correct interpretation and use of these templates.

## Configuration
These templates do not have specific configuration options defined within them. They use simple placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) which are expected to be populated with appropriate values when the templates are rendered.

The configuration and use of these templates would typically be managed by the larger FHIR converter system in which they are implemented. This system would be responsible for:

1. Selecting the appropriate template based on the input data and desired output.
2. Providing the correct values for the ID and REF placeholders.
3. Combining the outputs of multiple templates if a more complete MedicinalProductIndication resource is required.
4. Validating the generated FHIR resources against the FHIR specification.

It's important to note that these templates provide a basic structure and would likely need to be expanded or combined with additional data to create fully valid and comprehensive FHIR resources in most practical applications.
