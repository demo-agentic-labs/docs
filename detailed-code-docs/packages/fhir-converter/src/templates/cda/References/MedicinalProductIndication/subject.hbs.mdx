## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicinalProductIndication resource with a subject reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### MedicinalProductIndication Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProductIndication resource in FHIR format. It includes a subject reference, which is typically used to link the indication to a specific patient or group.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProductIndication resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the subject (e.g., a patient or group) |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicinalProductIndication resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicinalProductIndication",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "MedicinalProductIndication".
2. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the `id` field.
3. It creates a `subject` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, which is set to the provided `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and content of the MedicinalProductIndication resource |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The `subject` field is an array, suggesting that multiple subjects could be added if needed, although this template only includes one.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and references to be passed in, making it reusable for various MedicinalProductIndication resources.
