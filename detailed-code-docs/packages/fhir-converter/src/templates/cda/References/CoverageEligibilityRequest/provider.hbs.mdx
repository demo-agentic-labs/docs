## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with a focus on the provider field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource structure with a provider reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the provider associated with this request |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "CoverageEligibilityRequest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `provider`: An object with a `reference` field pointing to the associated provider

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "CoverageEligibilityRequest"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `provider` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be properly populated when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and likely meant to be combined with other partial templates to form a complete FHIR resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where Handlebars will interpolate values when rendering the template.
