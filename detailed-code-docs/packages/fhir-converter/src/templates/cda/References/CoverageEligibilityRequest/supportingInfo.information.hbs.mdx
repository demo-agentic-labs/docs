### Template
#### Description
This Handlebars template generates a JSON structure for a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with a focus on the `supportingInfo` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A partial JSON structure for a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "CoverageEligibilityRequest".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `supportingInfo` array with a single object.
5. Within the `supportingInfo` object, creates an `information` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure is partial and likely meant to be combined with other parts of a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource.
3. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for variable interpolation, which is standard Handlebars syntax.
4. The structure adheres to the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource type.
