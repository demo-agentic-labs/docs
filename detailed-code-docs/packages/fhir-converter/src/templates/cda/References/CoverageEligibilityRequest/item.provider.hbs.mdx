## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) CoverageEligibilityRequest resource. Specifically, it focuses on the `item.provider` element of the resource, which is used to specify the healthcare provider associated with a particular item in the eligibility request.

### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource in FHIR format. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an array of items, each containing a provider reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the provider associated with the item |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the CoverageEligibilityRequest details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "CoverageEligibilityRequest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `item`: An array containing a single item object
    - `provider`: An object with a `reference` property pointing to the associated provider

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure.
2. The `item` array contains a single object with a `provider` property, which in turn has a `reference` property.
3. The structure is nested to conform to the FHIR resource format for CoverageEligibilityRequest.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it is part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, focusing specifically on the `item.provider` element. It may be intended to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The use of Handlebars templating allows for dynamic insertion of the `ID` and `REF` values, making this template reusable for different CoverageEligibilityRequest instances.
