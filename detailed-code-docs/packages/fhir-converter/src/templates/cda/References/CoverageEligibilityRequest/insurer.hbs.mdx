## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource structure, specifically focusing on the `insurer` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with an `insurer` field. The `insurer` is represented as a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurer resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CoverageEligibilityRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "insurer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CoverageEligibilityRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's `id` field.
3. The `insurer` field is set as an object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. It's designed to be modular, focusing only on the `insurer` field of a CoverageEligibilityRequest.
3. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
4. The use of placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) suggests that this template is meant to be populated with actual data during the conversion process.
