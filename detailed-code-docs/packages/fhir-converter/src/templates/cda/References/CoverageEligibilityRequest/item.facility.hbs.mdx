### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, specifically focusing on the `item.facility` element. It creates a JSON object with nested properties for the resource type, id, and item array.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the facility associated with the item |

#### Outputs
The template generates a JSON structure representing a partial CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CoverageEligibilityRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "item": [
            {
                "facility": {
                    "reference": "{{REF}}"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the resource type as "CoverageEligibilityRequest".
2. It sets the resource id using the provided `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. An `item` array is created with a single object.
4. Within the item object, a `facility` object is defined with a `reference` property set to the provided `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering the final output.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the facility associated with the item |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from one format (possibly CDA) to FHIR.
2. The template only defines a partial CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, focusing specifically on the `item.facility` element. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete resource.
