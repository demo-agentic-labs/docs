## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resources. These templates are part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, such as the enterer, facility, insurance coverage, insurer, item details, patient, provider, and supporting information.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create various parts of a FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource. When combined, they form a complete representation of a request to determine the eligibility and benefits of a patient's health insurance coverage. The templates allow for dynamic insertion of data, making them flexible and reusable for different CoverageEligibilityRequest instances.

For example:
1. The `patient.hbs` template creates the patient reference section.
2. The `insurance.coverage.hbs` template generates the insurance coverage information.
3. The `provider.hbs` template adds the healthcare provider details.
4. The `item.facility.hbs` and `item.provider.hbs` templates create references to facilities and providers for specific items in the request.

These partial resources can be combined to create a complete CoverageEligibilityRequest resource that adheres to the FHIR standard.

## Key Files
1. `enterer.hbs`: Defines the person who entered the request.
2. `facility.hbs`: Specifies the facility associated with the request.
3. `insurance.coverage.hbs`: Represents the insurance coverage information.
4. `insurer.hbs`: Identifies the insurer for the request.
5. `item.detail.hbs`: Provides detailed item references.
6. `item.facility.hbs`: Associates facilities with specific items.
7. `item.provider.hbs`: Links providers to specific items.
8. `patient.hbs`: References the patient for whom the request is made.
9. `provider.hbs`: Specifies the provider making the request.
10. `supportingInfo.information.hbs`: Includes references to supporting information.

Each of these files generates a partial JSON structure that corresponds to a specific section of the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource. They use Handlebars syntax to allow for dynamic data insertion.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering the final output. They are part of the FHIR Converter project, which likely includes additional dependencies for the overall conversion process from CDA to FHIR.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include explicit configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders. Common placeholders include:

- `{{ID}}`: For the unique identifier of the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource.
- `{{REF}}`: For references to other resources (e.g., patient, provider, facility).

These placeholders allow for easy customization when the templates are rendered with actual data.

## Copyright and License
All files in this directory include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating:

In conclusion, these templates form a crucial part of a FHIR conversion system, enabling the transformation of CDA data into FHIR-compliant CoverageEligibilityRequest resources. They provide a modular and flexible approach to building these resources, allowing for easy maintenance and updates as FHIR standards evolve.
