### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource structure with an 'enterer' field. The 'enterer' field represents the person who entered the request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the person who entered the request |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CoverageEligibilityRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "enterer": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "CoverageEligibilityRequest".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's `id` field.
3. The `enterer` field is populated with a `reference` sub-field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

Note: The actual dependencies might vary based on the larger context of the FHIR Converter project.
