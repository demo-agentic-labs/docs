### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, specifically defining the `facility` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the facility associated with the request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "CoverageEligibilityRequest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "facility": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "CoverageEligibilityRequest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's id.
4. It creates a `facility` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. It includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `ID` and `REF` values to be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
4. This template only defines a partial resource structure and would typically be used in conjunction with other templates to create a complete FHIR resource.
