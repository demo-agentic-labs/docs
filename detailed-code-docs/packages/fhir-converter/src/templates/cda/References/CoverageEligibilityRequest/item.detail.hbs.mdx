### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, with a focus on the `item.detail` array. It allows for the inclusion of a reference within the detail of an item in the request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value to be included in the item detail |

#### Outputs
The template generates a JSON structure representing a partial CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, focusing on the `item.detail` section.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Within the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "CoverageEligibilityRequest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
4. The `item` array is created with a single object.
5. Within the item object, a `detail` array is created with a single object.
6. The detail object includes a `reference` property, which is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing the placeholders and generating the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

3. The structure allows for easy expansion to include multiple items or details if needed in the future.
