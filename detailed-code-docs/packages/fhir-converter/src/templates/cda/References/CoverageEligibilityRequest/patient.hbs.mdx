## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource structure, specifically focusing on the patient reference within the resource. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, with emphasis on the patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource in JSON format |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "CoverageEligibilityRequest".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. It creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`).

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
While this template doesn't define an API itself, it contributes to creating a FHIR-compliant resource structure. The resulting JSON, when complete, would conform to the FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource specifications.
