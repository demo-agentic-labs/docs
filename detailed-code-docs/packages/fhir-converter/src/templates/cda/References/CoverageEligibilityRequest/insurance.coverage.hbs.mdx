### CoverageEligibilityRequest Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource, specifically focusing on the insurance coverage information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityRequest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the associated Coverage resource |

#### Outputs
The template generates a JSON object representing a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityRequest resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "CoverageEligibilityRequest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `insurance`: An array containing a single object with coverage information
    - `coverage`: An object with a reference to the associated Coverage resource

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `insurance` array contains a single object, which in turn contains a `coverage` object with a `reference` field.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options. It uses two input variables (`ID` and `REF`) that should be provided when rendering the template.

1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it is part of the Metriport Inc. project and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template generates a partial FHIR resource, focusing only on the `insurance` array of the CoverageEligibilityRequest. It may be intended to be used as part of a larger template or combined with other partial resources to create a complete FHIR resource.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for CoverageEligibilityRequest resources, specifically the `insurance` element which is used to specify the insurance coverage for which the request is being made.
