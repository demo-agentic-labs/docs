## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR MeasureReport resource structure, specifically focusing on the "reporter" field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### MeasureReport Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MeasureReport resource, specifically defining the "reporter" field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MeasureReport resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the reporter of the measure report |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MeasureReport resource with the following structure:
- A "resource" object containing:
  - "resourceType": Always set to "MeasureReport"
  - "id": Set to the provided ID
  - "reporter": An object with a "reference" field set to the provided REF

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided ID and REF values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders in the template will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template only defines a partial MeasureReport resource. In a complete FHIR MeasureReport, there would typically be additional fields and nested structures.
4. The "reporter" field in a FHIR MeasureReport typically represents the organization or individual responsible for reporting the results of the measure.
