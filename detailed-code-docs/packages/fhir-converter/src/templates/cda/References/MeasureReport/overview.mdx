## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR MeasureReport resources. These templates are part of a larger system designed to convert Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field within the MeasureReport resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR MeasureReport resource. They provide a structured way to convert CDA data into FHIR format, specifically for MeasureReports. Each template generates a JSON snippet that represents a portion of the MeasureReport, such as the evaluated resource, the reporter, or the subject. When combined, these snippets can form a complete MeasureReport resource.

The process works like this:
1. CDA data is processed and relevant information is extracted.
2. This information is passed to the appropriate template(s) as variables.
3. The templates use this data to generate JSON structures that conform to the FHIR MeasureReport resource specification.
4. These JSON structures can then be combined to create a complete MeasureReport resource.

This modular approach allows for flexibility in resource creation and makes it easier to maintain and update individual components of the MeasureReport.

## Key Files

1. `evaluatedResource.hbs`:
   This template generates the `evaluatedResource` field of a MeasureReport. It creates an array containing references to resources that were evaluated as part of the measure.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "MeasureReport",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "evaluatedResource": [
         {
           "reference": "{{REF}}"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. `reporter.hbs`:
   This template creates the `reporter` field of a MeasureReport. It specifies the organization or individual responsible for reporting the results of the measure.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "MeasureReport",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "reporter": {
         "reference": "{{REF}}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. `subject.hbs`:
   This template generates the `subject` field of a MeasureReport. It identifies the individual, group, or other entity that is the subject of the measure report.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "MeasureReport",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "subject": {
         "reference": "{{REF}}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Each of these templates contributes to different aspects of the MeasureReport resource, allowing for a modular approach to resource construction.

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in JavaScript environments for generating text-based formats like HTML or, in this case, JSON. The templates are likely part of a larger Node.js-based conversion system.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have explicit configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of variables. The main configurable elements are:

1. `ID`: Used to set the unique identifier for the MeasureReport resource.
2. `REF`: Used to set references to other resources (e.g., the evaluated resource, the reporter, or the subject).

These variables would be populated with appropriate values when the templates are rendered as part of the CDA to FHIR conversion process.

## Notes
1. These templates are part of a larger FHIR Converter project, which appears to be maintained by Metriport Inc. and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The templates focus on specific fields of the MeasureReport resource, indicating that they are meant to be used as part of a larger template system for creating complete MeasureReport resources.
3. The modular nature of these templates allows for easy maintenance and updates to specific parts of the MeasureReport resource without affecting the entire structure.
4. While these templates provide the basic structure for key fields in a MeasureReport, a complete FHIR MeasureReport would typically include additional fields and nested structures. The conversion process would likely involve combining these templates with others to produce a fully-formed MeasureReport resource.
5. The templates use a consistent structure and naming convention, which suggests a well-organized approach to the overall conversion system.
