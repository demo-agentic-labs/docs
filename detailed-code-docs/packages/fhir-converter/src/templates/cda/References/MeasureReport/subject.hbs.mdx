## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR MeasureReport resource structure, specifically focusing on the `subject` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### MeasureReport Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MeasureReport resource, specifically defining the `subject` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the MeasureReport resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject of the MeasureReport |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MeasureReport resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MeasureReport",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MeasureReport".
2. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `subject` field is defined as an object with a `reference` property, which is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't define any specific configuration options. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. It only defines a partial MeasureReport resource, focusing on the `subject` field. Other parts of the MeasureReport would likely be defined in separate templates or through additional processing.
3. The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
4. The template uses a specific formatting style with comma-separated closing brackets, which might be part of a larger JSON structure when combined with other templates.
