## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial structure for a FHIR MeasureReport resource, specifically focusing on the `evaluatedResource` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### MeasureReport Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MeasureReport resource. It specifically defines the `evaluatedResource` array within the MeasureReport, which is used to reference resources that were evaluated as part of the measure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the MeasureReport resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the evaluated resource |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial MeasureReport resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "MeasureReport"
  - `id`: Set to the provided `ID`
  - `evaluatedResource`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF`

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `evaluatedResource` is defined as an array with a single object, allowing for easy extension if multiple evaluated resources need to be added in the future.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in JavaScript environments for generating HTML or other text-based formats.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The structure is fixed, with placeholders for `ID` and `REF` to be filled in when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is focused solely on the `evaluatedResource` field of a MeasureReport, suggesting it's meant to be used as part of a larger template system for creating complete MeasureReport resources.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and would likely be combined with other partial templates to form a full MeasureReport resource.
4. The use of Handlebars suggests this template is part of a JavaScript-based conversion system, likely used in a Node.js environment.
