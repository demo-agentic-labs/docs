### DeviceDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceDefinition resource with a parentDevice reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the DeviceDefinition resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the parent device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A FHIR-compliant DeviceDefinition resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "DeviceDefinition"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "parentDevice" object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders (\{\{ID\}\} and \{\{REF\}\}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (\{\{ID\}\} and \{\{REF\}\}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The resulting JSON structure is not complete and appears to be part of a larger object, as indicated by the trailing commas.
