### DeviceDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR DeviceDefinition resource with an owner reference. It's a partial template, likely to be used as part of a larger FHIR document or bundle.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the DeviceDefinition resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the owner of the device |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR DeviceDefinition resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "DeviceDefinition",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "owner": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "DeviceDefinition".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` of the resource.
3. It creates an `owner` object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and owner references to be passed in when used.
3. This template appears to be a partial representation of a DeviceDefinition resource, focusing specifically on the owner property. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource or bundle.
4. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests this might be part of a larger array or object in the final output.
