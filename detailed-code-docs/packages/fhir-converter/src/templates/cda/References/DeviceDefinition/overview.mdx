## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating FHIR DeviceDefinition resources. These templates are part of a FHIR converter system, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the DeviceDefinition resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource creation.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to generate JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR DeviceDefinition resource. They allow for the creation of device definitions with various properties such as manufacturer references, owners, and parent devices. When used in combination, they can produce complete FHIR-compliant DeviceDefinition resources.

The workflow typically involves:
1. Selecting the appropriate template based on the required DeviceDefinition property.
2. Providing necessary inputs (such as IDs and references) to the template.
3. Rendering the template to generate a JSON structure.
4. Combining the outputs of multiple templates to create a complete DeviceDefinition resource or incorporating it into a larger FHIR document or bundle.

## Key Files
1. manufacturerReference.hbs: Creates a DeviceDefinition resource with a manufacturer reference.
2. owner.hbs: Generates a DeviceDefinition resource with an owner property.
3. parentDevice.hbs: Produces a DeviceDefinition resource with a parent device reference.

Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the DeviceDefinition resource:

- manufacturerReference.hbs: This template is used when you need to specify the manufacturer of a device. It creates a JSON structure with a "manufacturerReference" object, which includes a reference to the manufacturer.

- owner.hbs: Use this template when you need to indicate the owner of a device. It generates a JSON structure with an "owner" object, containing a reference to the owner.

- parentDevice.hbs: This template is useful when defining a device that is part of or related to another device. It creates a JSON structure with a "parentDevice" object, which includes a reference to the parent device.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structures. Handlebars is used to insert dynamic values (such as IDs and references) into the predefined JSON structures.

## Configuration
These templates don't include specific configuration options. Instead, they use variables (such as ID and REF) that should be provided when the templates are rendered. This allows for flexibility in use, as the same template can be used to create multiple different DeviceDefinition resources by changing the input values.

For example, to use the manufacturerReference.hbs template, you would need to provide:
- ID: A unique identifier for the DeviceDefinition resource
- REF: A reference to the manufacturer

The same pattern applies to the other templates, with each requiring specific inputs to generate the desired JSON structure.

It's important to note that these templates appear to be partial representations of a DeviceDefinition resource, focusing on specific properties. They are likely designed to be used in conjunction with other templates to build complete FHIR resources or bundles.
