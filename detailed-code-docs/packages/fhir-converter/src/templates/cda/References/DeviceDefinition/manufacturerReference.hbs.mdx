### DeviceDefinition Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR DeviceDefinition resource with a manufacturerReference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and manufacturer reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DeviceDefinition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the manufacturer |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant DeviceDefinition resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "DeviceDefinition".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "manufacturerReference" object with a "reference" property, set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses two variables (ID and REF) that should be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.
