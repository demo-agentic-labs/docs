### MedicationStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationStatement resource. It includes an `id` and a `derivedFrom` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the resource from which this MedicationStatement is derived |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A FHIR-compliant MedicationStatement resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationStatement"
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
4. Creates a `derivedFrom` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is used.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
