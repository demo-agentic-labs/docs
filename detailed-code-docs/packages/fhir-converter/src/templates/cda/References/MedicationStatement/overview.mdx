## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of FHIR MedicationStatement resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or aspect of a MedicationStatement resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different components of a FHIR MedicationStatement resource. They allow for the dynamic insertion of data into predefined FHIR-compliant structures. For example:

1. The `basedOn.hbs` template creates a structure for a MedicationStatement that is based on another resource.
2. The `context.hbs` template defines the context (encounter or episode of care) for a medication statement.
3. The `derivedFrom.hbs` template specifies a resource from which the MedicationStatement is derived.
4. The `informationSource.hbs` template identifies the source of information for the medication statement.
5. The `medicationReference.hbs` template creates a reference to the medication itself.
6. The `partOf.hbs` template links the MedicationStatement to a parent resource.
7. The `reasonReference.hbs` template provides a reference to the reason for the medication.
8. The `subject.hbs` template specifies the subject (typically a patient) of the medication statement.

These templates can be used individually or combined to build complete FHIR MedicationStatement resources, allowing for flexible and modular data transformation from CDA to FHIR format.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Creates a MedicationStatement with a `basedOn` property, linking it to another resource.
2. `context.hbs`: Defines the `context` field, referencing an encounter or episode of care.
3. `derivedFrom.hbs`: Specifies the `derivedFrom` field, indicating the source of the MedicationStatement.
4. `informationSource.hbs`: Sets the `informationSource` field, referencing the origin of the information.
5. `medicationReference.hbs`: Creates the `medicationReference` field, linking to the actual medication resource.
6. `partOf.hbs`: Defines the `partOf` field, connecting the MedicationStatement to a parent resource.
7. `reasonReference.hbs`: Specifies the `reasonReference` field, providing a reason for the medication.
8. `subject.hbs`: Sets the `subject` field, typically referencing the patient.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicationStatement",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "specificField": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

Where `specificField` is replaced by the relevant field name (e.g., `basedOn`, `context`, etc.), and `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are placeholders for dynamic values.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely involving other components for parsing CDA data and assembling complete FHIR resources.

The templates adhere to the FHIR specification, which defines the structure and content of MedicationStatement resources. Therefore, the FHIR standard itself can be considered a key dependency for the correct interpretation and use of these templates.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include explicit configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of placeholders:

- `{{ID}}`: Used to set the unique identifier for the MedicationStatement resource.
- `{{REF}}`: Used to specify references to other resources or values for specific fields.

These placeholders allow for dynamic configuration when the templates are rendered as part of the FHIR conversion process.

In conclusion, this directory contains a set of modular Handlebars templates that work together to facilitate the conversion of CDA data into FHIR MedicationStatement resources. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the MedicationStatement, allowing for flexible and precise resource construction as part of a larger FHIR conversion system.
