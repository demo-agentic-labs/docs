## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicationStatement resource structure. It specifically focuses on the `partOf` field, which is used to reference another resource that this MedicationStatement is a part of.

### MedicationStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationStatement resource, specifically defining the `partOf` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another resource that this MedicationStatement is a part of |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationStatement resource with the `partOf` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationStatement".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `partOf` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field is populated with the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The `partOf` field in a FHIR MedicationStatement is used to link this statement to a parent resource, typically another MedicationStatement or a MedicationAdministration.
3. The template only defines a partial resource structure. In a complete FHIR MedicationStatement, there would be additional required and optional fields.
4. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which are not standard in JSON. These may need to be removed or handled by the system processing this template output.
