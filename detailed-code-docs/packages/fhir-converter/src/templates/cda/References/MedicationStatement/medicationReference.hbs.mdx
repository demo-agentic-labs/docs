### MedicationStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationStatement resource with a medicationReference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the medication reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the medication |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON representation of a FHIR MedicationStatement resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "MedicationStatement".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "medicationReference" object with a "reference" property, populated by the REF input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.
