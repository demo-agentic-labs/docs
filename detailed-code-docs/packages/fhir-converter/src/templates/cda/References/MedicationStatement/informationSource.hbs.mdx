### MedicationStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationStatement resource, specifically defining the `informationSource` field. The template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's `id` and the `reference` within the `informationSource` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the informationSource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationStatement resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicationStatement",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "informationSource": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationStatement resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationStatement".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
4. It creates an `informationSource` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the values passed for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the informationSource field of a MedicationStatement, suggesting it's part of a modular system for constructing FHIR resources.
3. The output is a partial resource, likely to be combined with other parts to form a complete MedicationStatement resource.
