### MedicationStatement Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MedicationStatement resource with a reasonReference field. The reasonReference field is used to link the medication statement to a reason for the medication, such as a condition or observation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the reason for the medication |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationStatement resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicationStatement",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "reasonReference": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}",
            },
        ],
    },
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a MedicationStatement resource type.
2. It sets the resource ID using the provided `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. It includes a reasonReference array with a single element.
4. The reference within reasonReference is set using the provided `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and content of the MedicationStatement resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the ID and reference to be dynamically inserted when used.
3. This template focuses solely on the reasonReference field of a MedicationStatement. In a complete FHIR MedicationStatement, there would typically be additional fields such as status, medicationCodeableConcept, subject, etc.
4. The structure allows for easy extension if multiple reason references need to be included in the future, as reasonReference is defined as an array.
