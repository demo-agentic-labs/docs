### MedicationStatement Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationStatement resource. It includes an `id` and a `basedOn` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the resource this MedicationStatement is based on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A FHIR-compliant MedicationStatement resource structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MedicationStatement".
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. Creates a `basedOn` array with a single object containing a `reference` property set to `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
- The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and references to be passed in for each use.
- The structure follows the FHIR standard for MedicationStatement resources, specifically focusing on the `basedOn` property which is used to link this statement to other resources that it's based on.
- The JSON structure is not complete and might be part of a larger template or system that combines multiple such structures.
