### MedicationStatement Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationStatement resource. It specifically defines the `context` field, which is used to provide a reference to the encounter or episode of care related to this medication statement.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this MedicationStatement resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the related encounter or episode of care |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial MedicationStatement resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicationStatement",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "context": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationStatement".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. The `context` field is populated with a `reference` sub-field, which is set to the `{{REF}}` input value.
