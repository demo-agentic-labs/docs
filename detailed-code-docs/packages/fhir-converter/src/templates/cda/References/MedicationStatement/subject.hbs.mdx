## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for the `subject` field of a FHIR MedicationStatement resource. It's designed to create a JSON object that represents a reference to the subject (typically a patient) associated with a medication statement.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationStatement resource, specifically focusing on the `subject` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject (typically a patient) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A structured JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationStatement resource with a subject reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationStatement".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration variables:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ID | string | None | The unique identifier for the MedicationStatement resource |
| REF | string | None | The reference to the subject of the medication statement |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger FHIR resource representation, as indicated by the trailing commas.
4. This template is specifically designed for the `subject` field of a MedicationStatement and would likely be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
