## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Media resource with a 'partOf' reference. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a Media resource that is part of another resource, typically used in healthcare data interoperability scenarios.

### Media Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Media resource. The resource includes an 'id' field and a 'partOf' array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Media resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource that this Media is part of |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Media resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a 'resource' property.
2. Inside 'resource', it sets:
   - 'resourceType' to "Media"
   - 'id' to the provided {{ID}}
   - 'partOf' as an array with a single object containing a 'reference' property set to {{REF}}

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The structure is fixed, with only the ID and REF values being variable.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions and disclaimers.
3. The 'partOf' array is structured to allow for multiple references, although this template only includes one. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified.
4. The JSON structure uses trailing commas, which is not standard JSON but is often accepted by modern parsers and can make version control diffs cleaner.
