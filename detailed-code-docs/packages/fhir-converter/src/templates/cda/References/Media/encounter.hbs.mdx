### Media Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Media resource with an encounter reference. The Media resource is used to represent media content like images, videos, or audio associated with a patient or other resources in healthcare contexts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Media resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Media resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Media",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "encounter": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Media".
2. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the Media resource.
3. It creates an `encounter` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses two input variables (`ID` and `REF`) that should be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.
