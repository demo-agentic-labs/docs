### Media Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Media resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a `basedOn` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Media resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource this Media is based on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Media resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Media"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `basedOn` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The structure of the Media resource is fixed, with placeholders for dynamic values.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
- The template uses FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for structuring healthcare data.
- The `basedOn` property in a FHIR Media resource typically refers to a request or order that led to the creation of this Media resource.
