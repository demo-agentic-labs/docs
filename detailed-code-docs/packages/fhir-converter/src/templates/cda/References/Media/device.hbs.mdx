## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Media resource with a device reference. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a Media resource in the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard, specifically focusing on the device associated with the media.

### Media Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Media resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a device reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Media resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON structure representing a FHIR Media resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Media"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `device` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
3. The resulting JSON structure is nested within a "resource" object, suggesting it might be used as part of a larger FHIR bundle or transaction.
4. The template only populates the minimal required fields for a Media resource with a device reference. Depending on the use case, additional fields might need to be added to create a fully compliant and useful FHIR Media resource.
