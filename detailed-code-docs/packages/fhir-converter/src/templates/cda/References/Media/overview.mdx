## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating FHIR Media resources with various references. These templates are part of a FHIR converter, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a different aspect of the Media resource, such as basedOn, device, encounter, operator, partOf, and subject references.

## What does it do?
These templates generate JSON structures representing FHIR Media resources. A Media resource in FHIR is used to represent various forms of multimedia content in healthcare contexts, such as images, videos, or audio files. Each template in this directory creates a Media resource with a specific reference type:

1. basedOn: Creates a Media resource based on another resource.
2. device: Associates the Media resource with a specific device.
3. encounter: Links the Media resource to a particular healthcare encounter.
4. operator: Specifies the operator responsible for the media content.
5. partOf: Indicates that the Media resource is part of another resource.
6. subject: Identifies the subject (usually a patient) of the media content.

These templates allow for flexible creation of Media resources with different relationships and contexts within a healthcare information system.

## Key Files
1. basedOn.hbs: Creates a Media resource with a basedOn reference.
2. device.hbs: Creates a Media resource with a device reference.
3. encounter.hbs: Creates a Media resource with an encounter reference.
4. operator.hbs: Creates a Media resource with an operator reference.
5. partOf.hbs: Creates a Media resource that is part of another resource.
6. subject.hbs: Creates a Media resource with a subject reference.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, creating a JSON object representing a FHIR Media resource with the specific reference type. They all use two input parameters: ID (for the resource identifier) and REF (for the reference value).

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically for converting CDA data to FHIR format.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in these templates. They use a fixed structure with placeholders for ID and REF values, which are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered.

Example usage (pseudocode):
```javascript
const template = Handlebars.compile(templateContent);
const result = template({ ID: "123", REF: "Patient/456" });
```

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating they are part of a project by Metriport Inc. and incorporate work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The templates are licensed under AGPLv3 with additional permissions.
3. The JSON structures use trailing commas, which is not standard JSON but is often accepted by modern parsers.
4. These templates provide a minimal structure for Media resources. Depending on the use case, additional fields might need to be added to create fully compliant and useful FHIR Media resources.
5. Error handling is not implemented within the templates. It's assumed that input validation and error handling would be managed by the system using these templates.
