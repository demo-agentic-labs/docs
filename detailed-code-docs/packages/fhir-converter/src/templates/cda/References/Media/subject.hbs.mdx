### Media Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Media resource with a subject reference. The Media resource is used to represent various forms of multimedia content in healthcare contexts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Media resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the Media resource |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR Media resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Media",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Media".
2. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the Media resource.
3. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used to render the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the correct provision of `ID` and `REF` values when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself but is likely used as part of a larger FHIR conversion API. The structure it produces conforms to the FHIR Media resource specification.
