## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for creating a FHIR Media resource with an operator reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Media Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Media resource with an operator reference. The Media resource is used to represent media content such as images, videos, or audio associated with a patient or other resources in healthcare data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Media resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the operator of the media |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR Media resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the Media resource details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Media"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `operator`: An object containing a reference to the operator

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the Media resource structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders in the template will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR converters for transforming data from one format to another.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The structure is fixed, and the values are expected to be provided when the template is used.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It's assumed that error handling and validation of input values would be managed by the system using this template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in the path `packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/Media/`, suggesting it's part of a FHIR converter package and is used for handling media references in CDA to FHIR conversions.
3. The structure of the output JSON is designed to conform to the FHIR specification for Media resources, focusing specifically on the operator reference.
