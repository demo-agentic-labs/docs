## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicinalProductInteraction resource structure. It specifically focuses on the `interactant` field, which contains a reference to another resource.

## Symbols

### MedicinalProductInteraction Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProductInteraction resource, which is used to represent interactions between medicinal products.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for this MedicinalProductInteraction resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to another resource that this interaction is related to |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing a MedicinalProductInteraction resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicinalProductInteraction".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates an `interactant` array with a single object.
5. Within the interactant object, it sets an `itemReference` object with a `reference` field, using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the MedicinalProductInteraction resource.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. If the `ID` or `REF` inputs are not provided, the corresponding fields in the JSON structure will be empty.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license appears to be a combination of AGPL v3 (for Metriport's contributions) and a permissive license (for Microsoft's original work).
3. This template is likely part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources, possibly from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data, as suggested by the file path.
4. The structure adheres to the FHIR specification for MedicinalProductInteraction resources, focusing specifically on the interactant's item reference.
