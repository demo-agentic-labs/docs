### Device Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Device resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a location reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Device resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location of the device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Device resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Device"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `location` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the input variables and generate the output JSON structure.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Device resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location of the device |

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to be called with the following context:
| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| ID | The identifier for the Device resource |
| REF | The reference to the location of the device |

Note: This template is designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion process, likely within a system that transforms CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
