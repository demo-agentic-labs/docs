## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR Device resources with various references. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the Device resource, such as its definition, location, owner, parent, or associated patient.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different aspects of a FHIR Device resource. They allow for the flexible creation of Device resources with various references, which is crucial in healthcare data management. For example:

1. The `definition.hbs` template creates a Device resource with a reference to its definition.
2. The `location.hbs` template generates a Device resource with a location reference.
3. The `owner.hbs` template produces a Device resource with an owner reference.
4. The `parent.hbs` template creates a Device resource with a parent device reference.
5. The `patient.hbs` template generates a Device resource associated with a specific patient.

These templates enable the conversion system to accurately represent medical devices and their relationships within a FHIR-compliant structure, facilitating interoperability in healthcare systems.

## Key Files
1. `definition.hbs`: Creates a Device resource with a definition reference.
2. `location.hbs`: Generates a Device resource with a location reference.
3. `owner.hbs`: Produces a Device resource with an owner reference.
4. `parent.hbs`: Creates a Device resource with a parent device reference.
5. `patient.hbs`: Generates a Device resource associated with a specific patient.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, using Handlebars syntax to create a JSON object representing a FHIR Device resource with specific references. They all require an `ID` input for the Device resource's identifier and a `REF` input for the specific reference (definition, location, owner, parent, or patient).

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the output JSON structures. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated into a framework that handles the actual template rendering and data population.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have specific configuration options, they expect two input variables to be provided when rendered:

1. `ID`: The unique identifier for the Device resource
2. `REF`: The reference to the specific aspect (definition, location, owner, parent, or patient)

These variables should be provided by the system using these templates during the conversion process.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they're based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The resulting JSON structures are not complete FHIR resources; they're nested within a "resource" object, suggesting they might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
3. These templates focus solely on specific aspects of the Device resource, omitting other potential properties. This modular approach allows for flexible composition of Device resources based on the available data and specific use cases.
4. The templates do not implement explicit error handling, assuming that the required input values will be provided correctly when rendered.
5. The modular nature of these templates allows for easy maintenance and updates to specific aspects of the Device resource representation without affecting the entire structure.
