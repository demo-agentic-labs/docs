## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Device resource with a parent reference. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a Device resource with a specific ID and a parent reference.

### Device Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Device resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a parent reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Device resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the parent Device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Device resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Device"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `parent` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders (\{\{ID\}\} and \{\{REF\}\}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (\{\{...\}\}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The resulting JSON structure is not a complete FHIR resource; it's nested within a "resource" object, which might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction.
4. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests that this might be part of an array of resources or a larger object.

This template provides a simple way to generate a Device resource with a parent reference, which could be useful in scenarios where medical devices have hierarchical relationships or when representing complex medical equipment setups.
