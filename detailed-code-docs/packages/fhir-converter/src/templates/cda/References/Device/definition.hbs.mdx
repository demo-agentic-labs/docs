### Device Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object representing a FHIR Device resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a definition reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Device resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the device's definition |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A FHIR-compliant Device resource representation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Device"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `definition` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
3. The resulting JSON structure is not complete and appears to be part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource collection, as indicated by the surrounding curly braces and commas.
4. The template focuses solely on the Device resource's core attributes and its definition reference, omitting other potential Device resource properties.
