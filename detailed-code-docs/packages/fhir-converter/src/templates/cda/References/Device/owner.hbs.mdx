### Device Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Device resource with an owner reference. The Device resource is used to record information about a medical device.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Device resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the owner of the device |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR Device resource with the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resource | Object | Contains the Device resource |
| resource.resourceType | String | Always set to "Device" |
| resource.id | String | The unique identifier for the Device resource |
| resource.owner | Object | Contains the reference to the owner of the device |
| resource.owner.reference | String | The actual reference to the owner |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the Device resource. The `resourceType` is hardcoded as "Device", and the `owner` field is populated with the provided reference.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON output |

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options for this template. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different types of owners to be referenced for the device.
3. The output is structured as a nested JSON object, which is likely part of a larger FHIR Bundle or response structure.
4. This template focuses solely on the owner reference of a Device resource. Other properties of the Device resource are not included in this template.
