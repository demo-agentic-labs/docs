### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure representing a FHIR List resource with a subject reference. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values for the resource's ID and subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the List resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject of the List resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A JSON structure representing a FHIR List resource with a subject reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a nested "resource" object.
2. The "resource" object is defined as a FHIR List resource type.
3. The "id" field of the resource is populated with the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. The "subject" field is an object containing a "reference" field, which is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. Error handling would typically be managed by the system using this template.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for use in the CDA to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure (packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/List/).
3. The generated JSON structure is not complete and would likely be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle in the actual conversion process.
4. The template uses minimal Handlebars syntax, only utilizing simple variable substitution for the ID and reference fields.
