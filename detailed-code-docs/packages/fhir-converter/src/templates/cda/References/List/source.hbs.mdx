## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR List resource with a source reference. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a List resource with minimal information, specifically focusing on the source of the list.

### List Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR List resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a source reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the List resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the source of the List |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR List resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "List",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "source": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "List".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the List resource.
3. It creates a `source` object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It depends on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the incorporated Microsoft work is provided under a more permissive license.
3. The template is specifically located in a directory structure suggesting it's part of a CDA to FHIR conversion system: `packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/List/`.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the trailing commas.

This template provides a basic structure for creating a List resource in FHIR format, focusing specifically on the source of the list. It's likely used as part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format, where additional templates or logic would be used to populate other parts of the FHIR resources.
