### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is the main (and only) template in the file. It generates a JSON structure for a FHIR List resource with an encounter reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the List resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR List resource with an encounter reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" of the resource to "List".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field of the List resource.
4. Creates an "encounter" object within the resource, containing a "reference" field with the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial or component of a larger FHIR resource generation system, as evidenced by the comma at the end of the JSON structure.
3. The structure adheres to the FHIR standard for List resources, including the required "resourceType" field and the optional "encounter" field.
4. The template is minimal and focused, dealing only with the List resource type and its association with an encounter. It doesn't include other potential properties of a List resource such as status, mode, or entries.
