## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR List resources with various references. These templates are part of a larger FHIR Converter project, specifically designed for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR format. The templates focus on creating different aspects of a FHIR List resource, including encounter references, entry items, source references, and subject references.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR List resource. They allow for the dynamic generation of List resources with specific references, which is crucial in the process of converting CDA documents to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a particular aspect of the List resource:

1. The encounter template creates a List resource associated with a specific healthcare encounter.
2. The entry item template generates a List resource with a single entry referencing another resource.
3. The source template creates a List resource with a reference to its source.
4. The subject template produces a List resource with a reference to its subject (typically a patient).

These templates can be used individually or combined to create complete FHIR List resources as part of the CDA to FHIR conversion process.

## Key Files
1. `encounter.hbs`: Creates a List resource with an encounter reference.
2. `entry.item.hbs`: Generates a List resource with a single entry item reference.
3. `source.hbs`: Produces a List resource with a source reference.
4. `subject.hbs`: Creates a List resource with a subject reference.

Each of these files contains a Handlebars template that generates a specific part of a FHIR List resource in JSON format. They all follow a similar structure, using placeholders for dynamic values such as IDs and references.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to be part of the FHIR Converter project, which likely provides the necessary context and data for rendering these templates.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration options within these templates, they are designed to be flexible through the use of placeholders. The behavior of each template is determined by the values passed for the ID and REF placeholders when the template is rendered.

Here's an example of how the `subject.hbs` template might be used:

```handlebars
{{&gt; References/List/subject ID="list123" REF="Patient/patient456"}}
```

This would generate a JSON structure like:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "List",
    "id": "list123",
    "subject": {
      "reference": "Patient/patient456"
    }
  }
}
```

The same pattern applies to the other templates in this directory, with slight variations in the structure depending on the specific reference type (encounter, entry item, or source).

These templates provide a foundation for creating FHIR List resources with various references, which can be combined and extended as needed in the larger CDA to FHIR conversion process.
