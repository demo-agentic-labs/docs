## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for an EvidenceVariable resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It specifically focuses on the characteristic.definitionReference field of the EvidenceVariable resource.

### EvidenceVariable Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EvidenceVariable resource with a single characteristic defined by a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EvidenceVariable resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the characteristic's definition |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing an EvidenceVariable resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "EvidenceVariable".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "characteristic" array with a single object.
5. Within the characteristic object, sets a "definitionReference" object with a "reference" property.
6. Assigns the provided REF value to the "reference" property.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the EvidenceVariable resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the characteristic's definition |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from multiple parties.
2. The structure follows the FHIR specification for EvidenceVariable resources, focusing on the characteristic.definitionReference field.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and references to be passed in for each use.
