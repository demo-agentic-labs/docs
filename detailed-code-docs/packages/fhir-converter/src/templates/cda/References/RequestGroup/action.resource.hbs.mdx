### RequestGroup Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR RequestGroup resource with a single action. The action contains a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RequestGroup resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another resource that is associated with the action |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR RequestGroup resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a RequestGroup resource with the specified `ID`.
2. Within the RequestGroup, an `action` array is created with a single element.
3. The action element contains a `resource` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license by Metriport Inc.
2. The structure of the JSON output follows the FHIR specification for a RequestGroup resource.
3. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources, specifically within the context of CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion.
