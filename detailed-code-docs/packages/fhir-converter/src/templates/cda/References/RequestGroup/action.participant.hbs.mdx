## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR RequestGroup resource with a single action containing a participant. It's designed to be used in the context of a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion process, specifically for handling references to participants within an action of a RequestGroup.

### RequestGroup Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR RequestGroup resource with a nested structure containing an action and a participant within that action.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RequestGroup resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the participant |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR RequestGroup resource with the following structure:
- A resource object of type "RequestGroup"
- An "id" field with the provided ID
- An "action" array with a single object containing:
  - A "participant" array with a single object containing:
    - A "reference" field with the provided REF value

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided ID and REF values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The structure is fixed, with only these two values being dynamically inserted.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and inserting the dynamic values.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the Microsoft portion is provided under a more permissive license that allows use, modification, and distribution with proper attribution.
3. The template is specifically designed for use in a CDA to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure (packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/RequestGroup/).
4. The structure of the RequestGroup resource follows the FHIR specification, but only includes the minimal necessary fields for defining an action with a participant.
5. This template appears to be a partial template, likely to be used as part of a larger RequestGroup resource construction process, as it only defines a single action with a single participant.
