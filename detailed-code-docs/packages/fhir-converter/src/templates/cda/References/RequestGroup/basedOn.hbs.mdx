## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a FHIR RequestGroup resource with a `basedOn` property. It's designed to generate a JSON structure representing a RequestGroup that is based on another resource.

### RequestGroup Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR RequestGroup resource with an `id` and a `basedOn` reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the RequestGroup resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource this RequestGroup is based on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR RequestGroup resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "RequestGroup".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `basedOn` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy modification or extension of the RequestGroup resource structure if needed.
3. The `basedOn` array is structured to allow for multiple references, although this template only includes one. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified to accept and include additional references.
