## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR RequestGroup resources. These templates are part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific part of the RequestGroup resource, allowing for modular and flexible construction of FHIR resources.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR RequestGroup resource. A RequestGroup is used in healthcare to group related requests for actions or services. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various components of a RequestGroup, such as:

1. Actions and their participants
2. References to other resources
3. Author information
4. Encounter references
5. Reasons for the request
6. Replacement information
7. Subject references

When used in a conversion process, these templates would be populated with data from a CDA document, resulting in a structured FHIR RequestGroup resource that maintains the original clinical information in a standardized format.

## Key Files
1. `action.participant.hbs`: Creates an action within the RequestGroup with a participant reference.
2. `action.resource.hbs`: Defines an action with a reference to another resource.
3. `author.hbs`: Adds author information to the RequestGroup.
4. `basedOn.hbs`: Specifies resources that this RequestGroup is based on.
5. `encounter.hbs`: Links the RequestGroup to a specific encounter.
6. `reasonReference.hbs`: Provides reasons for the request by referencing other resources.
7. `replaces.hbs`: Indicates that this RequestGroup replaces another resource.
8. `subject.hbs`: Specifies the subject (usually a patient) of the RequestGroup.

Each of these templates focuses on a specific aspect of the RequestGroup resource, allowing for modular construction and easy maintenance of the conversion logic.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely using additional libraries or frameworks for the full CDA to FHIR transformation process.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have explicit configuration options, they are designed to be flexible. Each template expects certain inputs (typically an ID and a REF value) which would be provided by the conversion system when rendering the templates. This allows for dynamic generation of FHIR resources based on the input CDA data.

## Notes
1. All templates in this directory include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are part of a project by Metriport Inc. and incorporate work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The templates generate partial JSON structures, suggesting they are meant to be combined to form complete FHIR RequestGroup resources.
3. The modular nature of these templates allows for easy extension or modification of the RequestGroup resource structure if needed.
4. Error handling is not implemented within the templates themselves, implying that input validation and error management are handled by the broader conversion system.
5. The templates follow FHIR specifications for the RequestGroup resource, ensuring compatibility with FHIR-compliant systems.
