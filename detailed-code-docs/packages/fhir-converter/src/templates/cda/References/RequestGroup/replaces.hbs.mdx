## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR RequestGroup resource with a 'replaces' field. It's designed to generate a JSON structure representing a RequestGroup that replaces another resource.

### RequestGroup Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR RequestGroup resource. It specifically focuses on the 'replaces' field, which indicates that this RequestGroup replaces another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this RequestGroup resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource that this RequestGroup replaces |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a FHIR RequestGroup resource with the following fields:
- resourceType: Always set to "RequestGroup"
- id: The unique identifier for this resource
- replaces: An array containing a single object with a 'reference' field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the outer structure of the resource.
2. It sets the resourceType to "RequestGroup".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the id of the resource.
4. In the 'replaces' array, it creates an object with a 'reference' field, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that valid values will be provided for ID and REF. If these values are not provided or are invalid, it may result in an invalid or incomplete JSON structure.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc.
2. The 'replaces' array in this template only includes a single item. If multiple replacements are needed, the template would need to be modified.
3. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which are not standard in JSON but are often accepted by modern parsers. Care should be taken when using the output with strict JSON parsers.
