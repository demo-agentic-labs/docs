### RequestGroup Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR RequestGroup resource with a subject reference. The RequestGroup is a FHIR resource that groups together a set of related requests for action.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RequestGroup resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the RequestGroup |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR RequestGroup resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "RequestGroup"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `subject`: An object with a `reference` field

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work within a Handlebars templating system, which is commonly used for generating HTML from templates. In this case, it's being used to generate JSON for FHIR resources.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the values passed for `ID` and `REF` when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. Error handling would typically be managed by the system rendering the template.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the 'subject' field of a RequestGroup resource, suggesting it's part of a modular system for constructing FHIR resources.
3. The structure of the output suggests that this template is meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR RequestGroup resource.
