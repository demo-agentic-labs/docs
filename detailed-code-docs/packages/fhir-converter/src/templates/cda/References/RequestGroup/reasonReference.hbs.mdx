### RequestGroup Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR RequestGroup resource with a reasonReference field. The reasonReference is an array containing a single reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the RequestGroup resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another resource that provides the reason for this request |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR RequestGroup resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" to "RequestGroup"
   - "id" to the provided {{ID}}
   - "reasonReference" as an array with a single object containing a "reference" field set to the provided {{REF}}

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the {{ID}} and {{REF}} placeholders will be properly populated when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license appears to be a combination of AGPL v3 (for Metriport Inc.) and a permissive license (for Microsoft Corporation).
3. The template is specifically designed for the FHIR standard, which is commonly used in healthcare information exchange.
4. The structure of the output JSON conforms to the FHIR RequestGroup resource specification.
5. The reasonReference field is designed to link this RequestGroup to another resource that provides the reason for the request, which is a common pattern in FHIR for establishing relationships between resources.
