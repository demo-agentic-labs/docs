## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR RequestGroup resource with an author reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR document conversion process, specifically for handling author information in a RequestGroup resource.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR RequestGroup resource. The template focuses on the `author` field of the RequestGroup, providing a way to include author information with a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the RequestGroup resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the author of the RequestGroup |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A partial FHIR RequestGroup resource in JSON format |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "RequestGroup".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the RequestGroup.
4. It creates an `author` object with a `reference` property, using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. However, it's designed to be part of a larger templating system, likely used in conjunction with other templates and a data context provided at runtime.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but is intended to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` values when rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure is not a complete FHIR RequestGroup resource. It only includes the `id` and `author` fields, suggesting it's meant to be combined with other partial resources or templates to form a complete FHIR document.
3. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests that this template might be used as part of a larger JSON array or object, where multiple resources are combined.
