### FamilyMemberHistory Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR FamilyMemberHistory resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the FamilyMemberHistory resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this family member history |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR FamilyMemberHistory resource.

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` placeholder is used for the resource's id, and `{{REF}}` is used for the patient reference.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |

| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) section of the FHIR converter, suggesting it's used for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
3. The JSON structure is minimal, containing only the essential fields for a FamilyMemberHistory resource. It may be part of a larger conversion process where additional fields are added or modified.
4. The template uses a nested structure with "resource" as the top-level key, which might be required by the specific FHIR converter implementation this template is used in.
