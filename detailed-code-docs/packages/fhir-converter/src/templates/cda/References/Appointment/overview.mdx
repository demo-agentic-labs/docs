## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR Appointment resources. These templates are part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the Appointment resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR Appointment resource. They handle various aspects of an appointment, such as:

1. The basis for the appointment (basedOn.hbs)
2. Participants in the appointment (participant.actor.hbs)
3. Reasons for the appointment (reasonReference.hbs)
4. Time slots for the appointment (slot.hbs)
5. Supporting information for the appointment (supportingInformation.hbs)

When used in combination, these templates allow for the creation of a complete FHIR Appointment resource from CDA data. The system is designed to be flexible, allowing for different parts of the Appointment resource to be generated as needed based on the available input data.

## Key Files
1. basedOn.hbs: Creates the `basedOn` field of the Appointment resource, which references other resources that this appointment is derived from.

2. participant.actor.hbs: Generates the `participant` field, focusing on the actor (person or resource) involved in the appointment.

3. reasonReference.hbs: Produces the `reasonReference` field, which provides a reference to the reason for the appointment.

4. slot.hbs: Creates the `slot` field, which references the time slot allocated for the appointment.

5. supportingInformation.hbs: Generates the `supportingInformation` field, which includes references to additional information relevant to the appointment.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Appointment",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "specificField": [
      {
        "reference": "{{REF}}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Where `specificField` is replaced by the relevant field name (e.g., `basedOn`, `participant`, etc.), and the structure is adjusted as necessary for each specific field.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely involving other templates and processing logic not present in this directory.

The templates adhere to the FHIR specification, which defines the structure and requirements for the Appointment resource.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include explicit configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders. The main configuration points are:

1. ID: A unique identifier for the Appointment resource.
2. REF: A reference to another resource, the specific meaning of which depends on the context of each template.

These placeholders would be populated during the conversion process, allowing for dynamic generation of Appointment resources based on the input CDA data.

## Notes
1. These templates only define partial Appointment resource structures. A complete FHIR Appointment resource would typically include additional fields such as `status`, `serviceType`, `priority`, `start`, `end`, etc.

2. The modular nature of these templates allows for flexible resource construction, but it also requires careful orchestration in the larger conversion system to ensure all necessary parts of the Appointment resource are included.

3. Each template file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that this is part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation, licensed under AGPLv3.

4. The templates are designed to handle single references in each field. If multiple references are needed (e.g., multiple participants or reasons), the templates would need to be modified or used iteratively.

5. Error handling and input validation are not present in these templates. It's likely that these concerns are handled in the broader conversion system that uses these templates.
