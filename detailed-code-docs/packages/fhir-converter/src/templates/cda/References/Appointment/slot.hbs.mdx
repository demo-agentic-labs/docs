### Appointment Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Appointment resource with a single slot reference. The Appointment resource is used to provide information about a planned meeting that may be in the future or past.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Appointment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated Slot resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Appointment resource with the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resource | Object | Contains the Appointment resource details |
| resource.resourceType | String | Always set to "Appointment" |
| resource.id | String | The unique identifier for the Appointment |
| resource.slot | Array | Contains a single object with a reference to the associated Slot |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "Appointment".
3. It sets the "id" of the Appointment using the provided `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. It creates a "slot" array with a single object containing a "reference" property.
5. The "reference" property is set using the provided `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and requirements for the Appointment resource |

## Notes

- The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the ID and slot reference to be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
- This template only covers the slot reference part of an Appointment resource. In a complete FHIR Appointment resource, there might be additional properties such as status, participant, or reason that are not included in this specific template.
