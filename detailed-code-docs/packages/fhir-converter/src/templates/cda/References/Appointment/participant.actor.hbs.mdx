## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Appointment resource structure, specifically focusing on the participant's actor reference within the Appointment resource. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Appointment Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for a FHIR Appointment resource, emphasizing the participant's actor reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Appointment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the actor (participant) in the appointment |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Appointment resource with a single participant and their actor reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an outer "resource" object.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Appointment".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "participant" array with a single object.
5. Within the participant object, creates an "actor" object with a "reference" field set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Appointment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the actor participating in the appointment |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The structure provided is a partial Appointment resource and would likely be combined with other templates to create a complete FHIR Appointment resource.
4. The template only includes a single participant with an actor reference. In a full Appointment resource, there could be multiple participants.
