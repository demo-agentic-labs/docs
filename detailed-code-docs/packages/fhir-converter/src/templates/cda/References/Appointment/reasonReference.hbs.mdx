### Appointment Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Appointment resource with a reasonReference field. The reasonReference is an array containing a single reference object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Appointment resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the reasonReference field |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Appointment resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Appointment",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "reasonReference": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "Appointment".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the Appointment resource.
3. The `reasonReference` field is an array with a single object containing a `reference` field, which is set to the `{{REF}}` input value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for `ID` and `REF`.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` values from the calling context and returns a JSON structure representing a FHIR Appointment resource.
