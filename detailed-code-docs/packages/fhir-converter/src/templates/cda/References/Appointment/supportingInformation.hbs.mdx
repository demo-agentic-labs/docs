### Appointment Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Appointment resource with a focus on the `supportingInformation` field. It provides a structure for including supporting information references in an Appointment resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Appointment resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Appointment resource with the `supportingInformation` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Appointment".
2. It sets the `id` of the Appointment using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `supportingInformation` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field is populated using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and rules for the Appointment resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`), which would be populated during the conversion process.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template only defines a partial Appointment resource structure, focusing solely on the `supportingInformation` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to create a complete FHIR Appointment resource.
3. The structure allows for only one supporting information reference. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified or used iteratively.
4. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that this template is meant to be processed by a Handlebars template engine, with the placeholders being replaced by actual values during processing.
