## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR Appointment resource structure, specifically focusing on the `basedOn` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Appointment Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Appointment resource with a focus on the `basedOn` field. The `basedOn` field is used to reference other resources that this appointment is based on or derived from.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Appointment resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to another resource that this appointment is based on |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR Appointment resource with the `basedOn` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for an Appointment resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Appointment".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the Appointment.
4. It creates a `basedOn` array with a single element.
5. The element in the `basedOn` array is an object with a `reference` field, which is set to the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It may depend on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, the use of uppercase placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) suggests that these values are expected to be provided by the context when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `id` and `basedOn` reference to be dynamically set when the template is rendered.
3. This template only defines a partial Appointment resource. In a complete FHIR Appointment resource, there would typically be additional fields such as `status`, `serviceType`, `priority`, `start`, `end`, `participant`, etc.
4. The `basedOn` field in this template is set up to contain only one reference, but in a full implementation, it could potentially contain multiple references.
