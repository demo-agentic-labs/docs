### MessageHeader Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR MessageHeader resource, specifically defining the `author` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MessageHeader resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the author of the message |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR MessageHeader resource with the `author` field defined |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "MessageHeader".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. The `author` field is set as an object with a `reference` property, which is assigned the value of `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the MessageHeader resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the author reference |
