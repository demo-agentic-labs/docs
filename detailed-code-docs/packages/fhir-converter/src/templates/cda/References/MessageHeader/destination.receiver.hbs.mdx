## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR MessageHeader resource with a destination receiver. It's specifically designed to create a JSON structure for the MessageHeader's destination receiver, which is a crucial part of message routing in FHIR-based systems.

### MessageHeader Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR MessageHeader resource, focusing on the destination receiver. It creates a nested structure with a single destination containing a receiver reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MessageHeader resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the receiver of the message |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MessageHeader resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "MessageHeader"
  - `id`: Set to the provided ID
  - `destination`: An array with a single object containing:
    - `receiver`: An object with a `reference` property set to the provided REF

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the outer structure of the resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MessageHeader".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. It creates a `destination` array with a single object.
5. Within the destination object, it defines a `receiver` object with a `reference` property set to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for ID and REF.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that valid values will be provided for ID and REF. If these values are not provided or are invalid, it may result in an incomplete or invalid FHIR MessageHeader resource.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template focuses solely on the destination receiver part of a MessageHeader, suggesting that other parts of the MessageHeader might be handled by separate templates.
