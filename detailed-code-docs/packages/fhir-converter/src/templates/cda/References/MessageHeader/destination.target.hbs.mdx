## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a FHIR MessageHeader resource, specifically focusing on the destination field. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a MessageHeader with a single destination target.

### MessageHeader Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR MessageHeader resource with a focus on the destination field. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the MessageHeader resource |
| REF | string | The reference value for the destination target |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A structured JSON object representing a FHIR MessageHeader resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "MessageHeader" and assigns the provided ID.
3. It then defines a "destination" array with a single object.
4. The destination object contains a "target" property with a "reference" field, which is populated with the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided correctly.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy modification or extension of the MessageHeader structure if needed in the future.
3. The current implementation only includes a single destination in the array, but the structure allows for multiple destinations if required in future use cases.
