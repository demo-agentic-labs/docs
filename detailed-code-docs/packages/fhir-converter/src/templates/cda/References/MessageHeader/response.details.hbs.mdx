## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a JSON structure for a FHIR MessageHeader resource with a focus on the response details. It's designed to be used in the context of a FHIR converter, specifically for handling CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversions.

### MessageHeader JSON Structure
#### Description
This template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR MessageHeader resource, specifically focusing on the response details. The structure includes the resource type, an ID, and a nested response object with a details property containing a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the MessageHeader resource |
| REF | string | The reference value for the response details |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a FHIR MessageHeader resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MessageHeader",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "response": {
            "details": {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` placeholder is used for the MessageHeader's id, and the `{{REF}}` placeholder is used for the reference value in the response details.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The structure is fixed, with only the `ID` and `REF` values being variable.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. Error handling would need to be implemented in the code that processes this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for a FHIR MessageHeader resource. The resulting JSON can be used as part of a FHIR API response or request.
