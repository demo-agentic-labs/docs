### MessageHeader Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MessageHeader resource with a focus on the sender field. It's structured to be included as part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MessageHeader resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the sender of the message |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MessageHeader resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MessageHeader".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. It creates a `sender` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for CDA to FHIR conversion, as indicated by its location in the directory structure (`packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/MessageHeader/`).
3. This template appears to be a partial representation of a MessageHeader resource, focusing only on the sender field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource or bundle.
