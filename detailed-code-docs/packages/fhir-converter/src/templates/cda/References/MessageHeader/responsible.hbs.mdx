## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR MessageHeader resource with a responsible party reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### MessageHeader Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MessageHeader resource with a responsible party reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the responsible party's reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the MessageHeader resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the responsible party |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR MessageHeader resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MessageHeader",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "responsible": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR MessageHeader resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the responsible party's reference.
3. The `resourceType` is set to "MessageHeader" to conform to FHIR specifications.
4. The `responsible` field is populated with a reference object containing the provided reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project by Metriport Inc., with some components originally from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion templates, under the References/MessageHeader path.
3. This template focuses solely on the 'responsible' field of a MessageHeader resource. Other fields that are typically part of a MessageHeader (such as event, source, destination) are not included, suggesting this template might be used in conjunction with others to build a complete MessageHeader resource.
