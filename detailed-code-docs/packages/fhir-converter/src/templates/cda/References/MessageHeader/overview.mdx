## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various components of FHIR MessageHeader resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter project, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or aspect of the MessageHeader resource, allowing for modular and flexible construction of FHIR resources.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of different parts of a FHIR MessageHeader resource. They handle various aspects such as:

1. Defining the author of the message
2. Specifying the destination receiver
3. Setting the destination target
4. Identifying the person who entered the data (enterer)
5. Referencing the main subject or focus of the message
6. Detailing the response information
7. Specifying the responsible party
8. Identifying the sender of the message

Each template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values into predefined JSON structures, ensuring that the output conforms to the FHIR MessageHeader resource specifications.

## Key Files
1. `author.hbs`: Defines the author field of the MessageHeader.
2. `destination.receiver.hbs`: Specifies the receiver in the destination field.
3. `destination.target.hbs`: Sets the target in the destination field.
4. `enterer.hbs`: Identifies the person who entered the data.
5. `focus.hbs`: References the main subject of the message.
6. `response.details.hbs`: Provides details about the response.
7. `responsible.hbs`: Specifies the responsible party for the message.
8. `sender.hbs`: Identifies the sender of the message.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MessageHeader",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "specificField": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

The `specificField` varies depending on the purpose of the template (e.g., "author", "sender", "responsible", etc.).

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering the final output. They are part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely used in conjunction with other components to transform CDA documents into complete FHIR resources.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have explicit configuration options, they expect two main inputs:

1. `ID`: A unique identifier for the MessageHeader resource.
2. `REF`: A reference value specific to the field being defined (e.g., a reference to the author, sender, or responsible party).

These values are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered as part of the conversion process.

## Notes
1. These templates are designed to be modular, allowing for flexible composition of MessageHeader resources. They can be combined or used individually as needed during the CDA to FHIR conversion process.

2. The templates focus on specific fields of the MessageHeader resource, suggesting that a complete MessageHeader might be constructed by combining multiple templates.

3. Error handling and input validation are not implemented within the templates themselves. It's assumed that these aspects are handled by the broader conversion system that utilizes these templates.

4. The copyright notices in each file indicate that this code is based on work by Microsoft Corporation but has been modified and is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.

5. The structure of these templates allows for easy extension or modification if additional fields or more complex structures are required in future versions of the FHIR specification or for specific use cases.
