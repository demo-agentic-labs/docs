### Patient Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Patient resource, specifically including the `generalPractitioner` field. The template uses Handlebars syntax to allow for dynamic insertion of values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Patient resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the general practitioner |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a FHIR Patient resource with the `generalPractitioner` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Patient".
2. It sets the `id` of the Patient resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
3. The `generalPractitioner` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. Error management would typically be handled by the system rendering the template.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy modification or extension of the Patient resource structure if needed.
3. The `generalPractitioner` field is set up as an array, which aligns with the FHIR specification allowing a patient to have multiple general practitioners.
4. The comma after the `reference` object in the `generalPractitioner` array suggests that the template might be designed to allow for easy addition of more fields or objects in the future.
