### Patient Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Patient resource with a contact organization. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the patient's ID and the organization's reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Patient resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the organization contact |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Patient resource with a contact organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a "resource" object with "resourceType" set to "Patient"
2. Sets the "id" of the Patient resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder
3. Defines a "contact" array with a single object
4. Within the contact object, creates an "organization" object with a "reference" field
5. Sets the "reference" of the organization using the `{{REF}}` placeholder

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses two placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) that should be populated when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as stated in the header comments.
3. The JSON structure follows the FHIR standard for Patient resources, specifically focusing on the contact information.
4. The template only includes the organization as a contact, without any additional contact details like name, address, or phone number.
5. The structure allows for easy expansion to include multiple contacts or additional patient information if needed in the future.
