## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating specific parts of FHIR Patient resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR Converter project, focusing on converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template in this directory addresses a different aspect of the Patient resource, such as contact organizations, general practitioners, linked resources, and managing organizations.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create standardized JSON structures for different components of a FHIR Patient resource. They allow for dynamic insertion of data into predefined FHIR-compliant structures. This process facilitates the conversion of patient information from CDA format to FHIR, ensuring that the output adheres to the FHIR standard while maintaining the flexibility to include various types of patient-related information.

## Key Files
1. `contact.organization.hbs`: Creates a Patient resource with a contact organization.
2. `generalPractitioner.hbs`: Generates a Patient resource structure with a general practitioner reference.
3. `link.other.hbs`: Produces a Patient resource with a link to another resource.
4. `managingOrganization.hbs`: Defines a Patient resource with a managing organization reference.

Each of these templates focuses on a specific aspect of the Patient resource, allowing for modular and flexible construction of the complete resource.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are designed to be used within the larger FHIR Converter project, which likely provides the necessary context and data for rendering these templates.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include explicit configuration options, they use placeholders (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) that should be populated when the templates are rendered. The behavior of each template is determined by the values provided for these placeholders during the conversion process.

Here's an example of how the `managingOrganization.hbs` template might be used:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "managingOrganization": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `{{ID}}` would be replaced with the patient's unique identifier, and `{{REF}}` would be replaced with a reference to the managing organization, such as "Organization/123".

These templates are designed to be flexible and easily extensible, allowing for future additions or modifications to the Patient resource structure as needed. They follow the FHIR standard for Patient resources, ensuring compatibility with FHIR-based healthcare data systems.
