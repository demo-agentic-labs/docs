### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure representing a FHIR Patient resource with a managingOrganization reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Patient resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the managing organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Patient resource with managingOrganization |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure with a `resource` object.
2. Inside the `resource` object, it sets:
   - `resourceType` as "Patient"
   - `id` using the `{{ID}}` placeholder
   - `managingOrganization` object with a `reference` property using the `{{REF}}` placeholder

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and conversion logic.

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the system rendering this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for generating part of a FHIR resource. It's likely used as part of a larger FHIR conversion system.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
