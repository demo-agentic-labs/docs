### Patient Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Patient resource with a link to another resource. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Patient resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the linked resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR Patient resource with a link to another resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a Patient resource with the given ID.
2. Creates a link array with a single element.
3. The link element contains an "other" object with a "reference" field.
4. The reference field is populated with the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template uses FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for structuring the Patient resource.
3. The link structure allows for connecting this Patient resource to another resource, which could be useful for scenarios like merging patient records or indicating relationships between patients.
4. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of different ID and REF values as needed.
