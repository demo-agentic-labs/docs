### DocumentReference Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource with a focus on the `subject` field. It's structured to be part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DocumentReference resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the document |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "DocumentReference".
2. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. The `subject` field is populated with a `reference` object, using the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the DocumentReference resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the subject reference |

1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a DocumentReference resource, likely to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource or bundle.
3. The structure adheres to the FHIR DocumentReference resource specification, particularly in defining the `subject` field as a reference to another resource.
