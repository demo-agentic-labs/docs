### DocumentReference Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource with a specific focus on the `context.encounter` field. It sets up the basic structure of a DocumentReference and includes placeholders for an ID and a reference to an encounter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DocumentReference resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines the basic structure of a FHIR DocumentReference resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "DocumentReference".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
4. In the `context` object, it creates an `encounter` array with a single object.
5. This object contains a `reference` field, which is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of placeholders:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Identifier for the DocumentReference |
| REF | String | Reference to the associated encounter |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, with additional permissions and disclaimers.
3. The structure suggests this template is meant to be part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
4. The template focuses solely on the `context.encounter` field of a DocumentReference, implying that other aspects of the DocumentReference might be handled by other templates or parts of the system.
5. The JSON structure includes some trailing commas, which might need to be handled or removed in the final output depending on the JSON parser being used.
