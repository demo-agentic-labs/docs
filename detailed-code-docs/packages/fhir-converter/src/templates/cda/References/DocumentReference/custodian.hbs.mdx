## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource structure, specifically focusing on the `custodian` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

## Symbols

### DocumentReference Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource with a focus on the `custodian` field. The custodian represents the organization responsible for maintaining the document.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DocumentReference resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the custodian organization |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource with the `custodian` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DocumentReference resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "DocumentReference".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `custodian` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be combined with other partial templates to form a complete DocumentReference resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
