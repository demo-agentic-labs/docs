## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource structure, specifically focusing on the `author` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR format.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DocumentReference resource, specifically populating the `author` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DocumentReference resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the author of the document |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A partial FHIR DocumentReference resource with the `author` field populated |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "DocumentReference".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. The `author` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` property set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It depends on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Templating engine used to generate the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing the `ID` and `REF` values to be dynamically inserted when the template is rendered.
3. The structure follows the FHIR DocumentReference resource format, but only includes the `author` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other partial templates to create a complete DocumentReference resource.
4. The JSON structure is not complete (it has trailing commas), suggesting it's meant to be part of a larger JSON object.
