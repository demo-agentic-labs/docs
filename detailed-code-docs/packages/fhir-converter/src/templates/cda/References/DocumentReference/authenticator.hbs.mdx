### DocumentReference Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR DocumentReference resource. It specifically defines the `authenticator` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the DocumentReference resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the authenticator of the document |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "DocumentReference",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "authenticator": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "DocumentReference".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the DocumentReference.
3. The `authenticator` field is populated with a nested object containing a `reference` field, which is set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format, specifically handling the authenticator information for a DocumentReference resource.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but has been modified by Metriport Inc.
3. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a DocumentReference resource, likely to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where dynamic content should be inserted when the template is rendered.
