## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR DocumentReference resource structure, specifically focusing on the `relatesTo` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR format, particularly for establishing relationships between documents.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a partial DocumentReference resource in FHIR format. It specifically defines the `relatesTo` field, which is used to establish relationships between documents.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the DocumentReference resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the target document that this document relates to |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial DocumentReference resource with the `relatesTo` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure for a FHIR resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "DocumentReference".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `relatesTo` array with a single object.
5. Within the `relatesTo` object, it sets the `target.reference` field using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template doesn't explicitly depend on external libraries, but it's designed to be used within a Handlebars templating system, likely as part of a larger FHIR conversion process.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't implement any specific error handling. Error management would likely be handled by the surrounding Handlebars templating system.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of the Metriport Inc. codebase.
2. The structure of the output suggests this is a partial template, likely to be combined with other templates to form a complete DocumentReference resource.
3. The `relatesTo` field is used in FHIR to establish relationships between documents, which can be crucial for maintaining document history and versioning in healthcare information exchange scenarios.
