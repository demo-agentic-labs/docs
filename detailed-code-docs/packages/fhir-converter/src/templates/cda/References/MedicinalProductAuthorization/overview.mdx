## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicinalProductAuthorization resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. The templates focus on different aspects of the MedicinalProductAuthorization resource, including the holder, regulator, and subject references.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a MedicinalProductAuthorization in the FHIR standard. They allow for the dynamic generation of FHIR resources based on input data, facilitating the conversion of healthcare information between different standards. 

Specifically:
1. The "holder" template creates a resource with information about the authorization holder.
2. The "regulator" template generates a resource focusing on the regulatory body.
3. The "subject" template produces a resource referencing the subject of the authorization.

Each template takes an ID and a reference as inputs, and outputs a JSON object that forms part of a larger FHIR resource structure. This modular approach allows for flexible and reusable code in the conversion process.

## Key Files
1. `holder.hbs`: This template creates a MedicinalProductAuthorization resource with a focus on the holder of the authorization. It takes an ID and a reference to the holder as inputs.

2. `regulator.hbs`: This template generates a MedicinalProductAuthorization resource emphasizing the regulator information. It requires an ID and a reference to the regulator as inputs.

3. `subject.hbs`: This template produces a MedicinalProductAuthorization resource with a subject reference. It needs an ID and a reference to the subject as inputs.

Each of these files follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "MedicinalProductAuthorization",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "{{key}}": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
},
```

Where `{{key}}` is replaced by "holder", "regulator", or "subject" depending on the specific template.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, which would provide the necessary context and data for rendering the templates.

## Configuration
These templates do not include specific configuration options. They use predefined structures for the MedicinalProductAuthorization FHIR resource and rely on two input variables:

1. `{{ID}}`: The unique identifier for the MedicinalProductAuthorization resource.
2. `{{REF}}`: The reference to the holder, regulator, or subject, depending on the specific template.

These variables are expected to be provided by the larger system when rendering the templates.

It's worth noting that these templates generate partial JSON structures, as indicated by the trailing commas. This suggests they are designed to be part of a larger JSON object or array in the actual implementation of the FHIR converter.

The templates are crucial components in a healthcare data interoperability solution, facilitating the standardization and exchange of medicinal product authorization information across different healthcare systems and standards.
