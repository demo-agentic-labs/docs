### MedicinalProductAuthorization Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MedicinalProductAuthorization resource with an ID and a subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProductAuthorization resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the authorization |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicinalProductAuthorization resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a resource object with type "MedicinalProductAuthorization"
2. Sets the resource ID using the provided `{{ID}}` value
3. Defines a subject object with a reference using the provided `{{REF}}` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input variables (ID and REF) will be provided correctly.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial component of a larger FHIR resource structure, as indicated by the comma at the end of the JSON object.
3. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where dynamic content should be inserted when the template is rendered.

This template is a small but crucial part of a system for converting healthcare data between different standards, specifically from CDA to FHIR in this case. It focuses on representing the authorization details for a medicinal product, which is an important aspect of healthcare information exchange.
