## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial structure for a FHIR PaymentNotice resource, specifically focusing on the payee field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentNotice resource. It specifically defines the `payee` field within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the PaymentNotice resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the payee |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | Object | A partial FHIR PaymentNotice resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentNotice".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `payee` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA to FHIR format. It likely depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be used within a larger templating system, which may have its own configuration settings.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided correctly by the calling context.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure suggests that this template is meant to be part of a larger FHIR resource generation process, likely used in conjunction with other templates to build complete FHIR resources.
3. The use of double curly braces (`{{}}`) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
4. The template only defines a partial structure. In a complete FHIR PaymentNotice resource, there would typically be additional fields.

This template provides a standardized way to generate the payee information for a PaymentNotice resource, ensuring consistency in the conversion process from CDA to FHIR format.
