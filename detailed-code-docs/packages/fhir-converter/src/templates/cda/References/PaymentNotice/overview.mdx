## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR PaymentNotice resources. These templates are part of a larger system designed to convert Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or component of the PaymentNotice resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR PaymentNotice resource. A PaymentNotice is used in healthcare systems to indicate that a payment has been made or is expected. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various components of a PaymentNotice, such as:

1. The payee (recipient of the payment)
2. The payment itself
3. The provider (entity providing the service)
4. The recipient of the notice
5. The associated request
6. The response to the notice

By using these templates, developers can generate standardized FHIR-compliant JSON structures for PaymentNotice resources, ensuring consistency and interoperability in healthcare data exchange.

## Key Files
1. `payee.hbs`: Generates the payee field of a PaymentNotice.
2. `payment.hbs`: Creates the payment field, referencing the associated payment.
3. `provider.hbs`: Produces the provider field, indicating the entity providing the service.
4. `recipient.hbs`: Generates the recipient field of the PaymentNotice.
5. `request.hbs`: Creates the request field, referencing the associated request.
6. `response.hbs`: Produces the response field of the PaymentNotice.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a partial JSON object for a PaymentNotice resource with the specific field it's responsible for. They all include the resource type, an ID, and the relevant reference field.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated with other templates and processing logic.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of input variables. Each template typically accepts two inputs:

1. `ID`: A unique identifier for the PaymentNotice resource.
2. `REF`: A reference to the relevant entity (e.g., payee, payment, provider) depending on the specific template.

These inputs allow for dynamic generation of PaymentNotice resources based on the specific data being processed.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how the `payment.hbs` template might be used:

```handlebars
{{&gt; PaymentNotice/payment ID="payment-notice-001" REF="Payment/12345"}}
```

This would generate a JSON structure like:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "PaymentNotice",
    "id": "payment-notice-001",
    "payment": {
      "reference": "Payment/12345"
    }
  }
}
```

Similar usage patterns apply to the other templates in this directory, with each focusing on its specific field within the PaymentNotice resource.

In a complete system, these templates would likely be combined and processed together to generate full PaymentNotice resources, with additional logic to handle the integration of the various components and any necessary data transformations from the source CDA format to the target FHIR format.
