### PaymentNotice Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentNotice resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a response field with a reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the PaymentNotice resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the response field |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR PaymentNotice resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentNotice"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `response` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion system.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template produces a minimal PaymentNotice resource structure. In a real-world scenario, additional fields might be necessary depending on the specific use case and FHIR implementation guide being followed.
3. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests this template might be used as part of a larger JSON array or object, potentially in conjunction with other resources or data.
