## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR PaymentNotice resource structure, specifically focusing on the recipient field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template system for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentNotice resource, specifically the recipient field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the PaymentNotice resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the recipient of the payment notice |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | object | A partial FHIR PaymentNotice resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentNotice".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the PaymentNotice resource.
4. It creates a `recipient` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used to render this template |
| FHIR specification | Defines the structure and content of the PaymentNotice resource |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a file conversion system from CDA to FHIR format.
2. It includes a detailed copyright notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
3. The template only defines a partial PaymentNotice resource, focusing on the recipient. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates to create a complete FHIR resource.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
5. The JSON structure is not complete and would need to be integrated into a larger JSON object to be valid FHIR.
