### PaymentNotice Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentNotice resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a request reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the PaymentNotice resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the request associated with this PaymentNotice |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR PaymentNotice resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentNotice"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `request` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the PaymentNotice resource.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a PaymentNotice resource, focusing specifically on the 'request' field. It may be intended to be used as part of a larger template or system for generating complete FHIR resources.
3. The JSON structure includes extra commas at the end of some lines, which might need to be handled or removed when processing the output, depending on the requirements of the consuming system.
