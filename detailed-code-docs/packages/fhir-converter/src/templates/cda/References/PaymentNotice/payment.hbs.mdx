### PaymentNotice Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR PaymentNotice resource. It includes placeholders for an ID and a payment reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the PaymentNotice resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the associated payment |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR PaymentNotice resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "PaymentNotice",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "payment": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "PaymentNotice".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the resource.
3. It creates a `payment` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the reference value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the PaymentNotice resource with placeholders for variable data.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from multiple parties (Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation).
2. The template is relatively simple and focused, providing only the essential fields for a PaymentNotice resource.
3. The structure of the output suggests that this template might be used as part of a larger FHIR resource generation process, as it's wrapped in a "resource" object.
