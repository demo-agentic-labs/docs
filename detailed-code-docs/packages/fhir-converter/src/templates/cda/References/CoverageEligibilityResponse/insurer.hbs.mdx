## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource structure, specifically focusing on the `insurer` field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

## Symbols

### CoverageEligibilityResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource with an `insurer` field. The `insurer` is represented as a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the insurer resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource with the `insurer` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "CoverageEligibilityResponse".
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. Defines the `insurer` field as an object with a `reference` property, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
The template uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| {{ID}} | String | Placeholder for the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource ID |
| {{REF}} | String | Placeholder for the insurer reference |

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The template produces a partial resource structure and would likely be combined with other templates or data to create a complete FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource.
4. The output is structured as nested JSON objects, which is consistent with FHIR resource formatting.
