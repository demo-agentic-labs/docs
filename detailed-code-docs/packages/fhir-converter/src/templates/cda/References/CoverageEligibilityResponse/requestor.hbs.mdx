### CoverageEligibilityResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource, with emphasis on the "requestor" field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the requestor of the CoverageEligibilityResponse |

#### Outputs
A partial JSON structure representing a CoverageEligibilityResponse resource with the following fields:
- resourceType: Always set to "CoverageEligibilityResponse"
- id: The unique identifier for this resource
- requestor: An object containing a reference to the requestor

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the resourceType to "CoverageEligibilityResponse"
2. Assigns the provided ID to the id field
3. Creates a requestor object with a reference field, populated by the REF input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF inputs will be provided correctly.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting between different healthcare data formats, specifically for generating FHIR-compliant JSON from other data sources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be combined with other partial templates to form a complete CoverageEligibilityResponse resource.
4. The template uses Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.
