### CoverageEligibilityResponse Template
#### Description

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the original eligibility request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | Object | A partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "CoverageEligibilityResponse"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `request` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The generated JSON structure is partial and may need to be combined with other data to form a complete FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource.
3. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for Handlebars variable substitution.
