## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resources. These templates focus on specific fields within the CoverageEligibilityResponse structure, such as insurance coverage, insurer, patient, request, and requestor. They are designed to be used as part of a larger system for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different aspects of a FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource. Each template focuses on a specific field or set of fields within the resource:

1. The insurance coverage template creates a structure for the insurance coverage reference.
2. The insurer template generates a structure for the insurer reference.
3. The patient template produces a structure for the patient reference.
4. The request template creates a structure for the reference to the original eligibility request.
5. The requestor template generates a structure for the requestor reference.

When combined, these templates allow for the creation of a complete CoverageEligibilityResponse resource by assembling the individual components. This modular approach enables flexibility in generating FHIR resources based on available data and specific use cases.

## Key Files
1. `insurance.coverage.hbs`: Generates the insurance coverage reference structure.
2. `insurer.hbs`: Creates the insurer reference structure.
3. `patient.hbs`: Produces the patient reference structure.
4. `request.hbs`: Generates the structure for the reference to the original eligibility request.
5. `requestor.hbs`: Creates the requestor reference structure.

Each of these files follows a similar pattern, creating a partial JSON structure for a specific aspect of the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource. They all use the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering the final output. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely depending on other templates or helper functions not visible in this directory.

## Configuration
The templates use Handlebars syntax for variable substitution. Common placeholders include:

- `{{ID}}`: Used for the unique identifier of the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource.
- `{{REF}}`: Used for references to other resources (e.g., Coverage, Patient, Practitioner).

These placeholders are expected to be populated with appropriate values when the templates are rendered.

## Notes
1. All files in this directory include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are part of the Metriport Inc. project and incorporate work from Microsoft Corporation. They are licensed under AGPLv3.

2. The templates produce partial resource structures and are likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to create complete FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resources.

3. The modular approach used in these templates allows for flexibility in resource generation, as different components can be included or excluded based on available data or specific requirements.

4. Error handling is not explicitly implemented in these templates. They assume that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided and valid when the templates are rendered.

5. The templates focus solely on specific fields within the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource. Other fields that might be part of a complete resource are not included in these templates.

6. The use of Handlebars templating suggests that this system is designed for server-side rendering of FHIR resources, possibly as part of a larger data transformation pipeline.
