### CoverageEligibilityResponse Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource, specifically focusing on the insurance coverage reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the CoverageEligibilityResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated Coverage resource |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "CoverageEligibilityResponse"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `insurance`: An array containing a single object with:
    - `coverage`: An object with a `reference` field pointing to the associated Coverage resource

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to inject the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` placeholder is used for the resource id, and `{{REF}}` is used for the coverage reference.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it is part of the Metriport Inc. project and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template focuses solely on the insurance coverage reference within a CoverageEligibilityResponse. It does not include other potential fields that might be part of a complete CoverageEligibilityResponse resource.
3. The structure suggests that this template might be used as part of a larger system for generating FHIR resources, possibly in conjunction with other templates or data sources.
