## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicinalProduct resource with a specialDesignation and indicationReference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### MedicinalProduct Resource Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a MedicinalProduct resource with a specialDesignation that includes an indicationReference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProduct resource |
| REF  | String | The reference value for the indicationReference |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "MedicinalProduct"
- id: The provided ID
- specialDesignation: An array containing one object with:
  - indicationReference: An object with a reference property set to the provided REF value

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided ID and REF values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` placeholders will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR converters for transforming data between different healthcare data formats.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The structure of the MedicinalProduct resource is fixed, with only the ID and reference values being variable.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. Error management would typically be handled by the system using this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API itself, but it's part of a larger system (likely a FHIR converter) that would use this template to generate FHIR-compliant JSON representations of MedicinalProduct resources.
