## High-level description

### MedicinalProduct Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource with an attached document reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProduct resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the attached document |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource with an attached document |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MedicinalProduct".
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. Defines an `attachedDocument` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the MedicinalProduct resource.

## Error Handling
The template doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON output is compliant with the FHIR standard for MedicinalProduct resources, specifically focusing on the `attachedDocument` field.
3. The template only includes the minimal required fields for a MedicinalProduct resource with an attached document. In a real-world scenario, additional fields might be necessary depending on the specific use case.
