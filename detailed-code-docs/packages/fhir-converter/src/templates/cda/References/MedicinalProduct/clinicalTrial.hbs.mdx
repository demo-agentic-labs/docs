## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource with a clinicalTrial reference. It's designed to convert data from a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format, specifically for representing clinical trial information related to a medicinal product.

### MedicinalProduct Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource with a clinicalTrial reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the clinical trial reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProduct resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the clinical trial associated with the medicinal product |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "MedicinalProduct"
- id: The provided ID
- clinicalTrial: An array containing a single object with a reference to the clinical trial

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the resourceType to "MedicinalProduct".
3. It sets the id of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. It creates a clinicalTrial array with a single object containing a reference property.
5. The reference property is set using the provided `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The values for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required values (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for creating a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource. The resulting JSON can be used as part of a FHIR API request or response.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resource.resourceType | String | Always set to "MedicinalProduct" |
| resource.id | String | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProduct resource |
| resource.clinicalTrial[0].reference | String | A reference to the associated clinical trial |
