## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template for generating a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicinalProduct resource with a focus on the manufacturing business operation's regulator. It defines a specific structure for the MedicinalProduct resource, including an ID and a reference to the regulator.

### MedicinalProduct Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProduct resource in FHIR format. It specifically focuses on the `manufacturingBusinessOperation` field, which includes a `regulator` reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The identifier for the MedicinalProduct resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the regulator |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "MedicinalProduct"
  - `id`: The identifier of the resource
  - `manufacturingBusinessOperation`: An array containing manufacturing operation details
    - `regulator`: An object with a reference to the regulator

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the JSON structure.
2. The `manufacturingBusinessOperation` is an array with a single object, which contains the `regulator` information.
3. The `regulator` is represented by a reference, which is populated using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
- The template is designed to be a partial representation of a MedicinalProduct resource, focusing specifically on the manufacturing business operation's regulator. It may be used as part of a larger system for generating complete FHIR resources.
- The structure follows the FHIR specification for MedicinalProduct resources, but only includes a subset of the possible fields.
