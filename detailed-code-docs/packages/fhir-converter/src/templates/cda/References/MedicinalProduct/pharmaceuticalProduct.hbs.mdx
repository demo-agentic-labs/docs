### MedicinalProduct Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource with a focus on the pharmaceuticalProduct field. It uses Handlebars syntax to allow for dynamic insertion of values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProduct resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the pharmaceutical product |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicinalProduct resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets the "resourceType" to "MedicinalProduct".
3. It assigns the provided `{{ID}}` to the "id" field.
4. The "pharmaceuticalProduct" field is an array containing a single object.
5. This object has a "reference" field, which is populated with the provided `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic parts of the JSON structure.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The structure is fixed, with only the ID and REF values being configurable through Handlebars placeholders.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.
