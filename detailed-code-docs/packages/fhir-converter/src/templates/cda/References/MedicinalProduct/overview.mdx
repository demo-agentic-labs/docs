## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR MedicinalProduct resources with various references. These templates are part of a FHIR converter system, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the MedicinalProduct resource, such as attached documents, clinical trials, contacts, manufacturing operations, master files, packaged products, pharmaceutical products, and special designations.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of MedicinalProduct resources in the FHIR standard. They allow for the dynamic insertion of specific identifiers and references, enabling the conversion of data from other healthcare formats (like CDA) into FHIR-compliant JSON objects. Each template addresses a particular aspect of a medicinal product, such as:

1. Attaching documents to the product
2. Referencing associated clinical trials
3. Specifying contact information
4. Detailing manufacturing business operations, including manufacturers and regulators
5. Referencing master files
6. Describing packaged medicinal products
7. Linking to pharmaceutical product information
8. Indicating special designations and their associated indications

By using these templates, developers can ensure that the generated FHIR resources are consistently structured and compliant with the FHIR specification for MedicinalProduct resources.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual Handlebars templates, each focusing on a specific aspect of the MedicinalProduct resource. The key templates include:

1. `attachedDocument.hbs`: For adding document references to a MedicinalProduct
2. `clinicalTrial.hbs`: For linking clinical trials to a MedicinalProduct
3. `contact.hbs`: For specifying contact information
4. `manufacturingBusinessOperation.manufacturer.hbs` and `manufacturingBusinessOperation.regulator.hbs`: For detailing manufacturing operations
5. `masterFile.hbs`: For referencing master files
6. `packagedMedicinalProduct.hbs`: For describing packaged products
7. `pharmaceuticalProduct.hbs`: For linking to pharmaceutical product information
8. `specialDesignation.indicationReference.hbs`: For indicating special designations

These templates are designed to be used together to build a complete MedicinalProduct resource, with each template contributing a specific section or reference to the overall resource structure.

## Key Files
All files in this directory are important as they each represent a different aspect of the MedicinalProduct resource. However, some key files include:

1. `attachedDocument.hbs`: Crucial for linking important documents to the medicinal product.
2. `manufacturingBusinessOperation.manufacturer.hbs` and `manufacturingBusinessOperation.regulator.hbs`: Essential for regulatory compliance and manufacturing details.
3. `pharmaceuticalProduct.hbs`: Important for linking to the actual pharmaceutical product information.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final JSON structures. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR converter system, which would provide the necessary context and data for rendering the templates.

## Configuration
The templates themselves do not define specific configuration options. They use a fixed structure for each aspect of the MedicinalProduct resource, with placeholders for dynamic values (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`). The actual configuration and data insertion would be handled by the FHIR converter system using these templates.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of templates for generating FHIR-compliant MedicinalProduct resources. These templates offer flexibility in representing various aspects of medicinal products while ensuring consistency with the FHIR standard. They are designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion system, allowing for the transformation of healthcare data from formats like CDA into the FHIR standard.
