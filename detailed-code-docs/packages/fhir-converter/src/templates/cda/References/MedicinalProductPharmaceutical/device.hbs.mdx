### MedicinalProductPharmaceutical Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProductPharmaceutical FHIR resource. It includes basic resource information and a device reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a MedicinalProductPharmaceutical FHIR resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Within the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "MedicinalProductPharmaceutical".
3. It assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. In the "device" array, it includes a single object with a "reference" property set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON is minimal, focusing only on the device reference. In a real-world scenario, a MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource might include additional properties.
3. The device array is hardcoded to include only one device reference. If multiple device references are needed, the template would need to be modified.
4. The template doesn't include any error handling or conditional logic. It assumes that both ID and REF will be provided when the template is rendered.
