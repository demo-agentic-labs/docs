## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resources. The templates are specifically designed to create JSON structures representing pharmaceutical product information, focusing on device and ingredient references.

## What does it do?
These templates are used in a FHIR conversion process to transform data into standardized FHIR resources. They generate JSON representations of MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resources, which are part of the FHIR standard for describing medicinal products. The templates allow for the inclusion of references to devices and ingredients associated with the pharmaceutical product.

## Key Files
1. device.hbs: This template generates a MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource with a device reference. It creates a JSON structure that includes a unique identifier for the resource and a reference to an associated device.

2. ingredient.hbs: This template creates a MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource with an ingredient reference. It produces a JSON structure containing a unique identifier for the resource and a reference to an ingredient associated with the pharmaceutical product.

Both templates follow a similar structure but focus on different aspects of the pharmaceutical product (device vs. ingredient).

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output. They are designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, likely part of the fhir-converter package.

## Configuration
The templates do not include specific configuration options. They use a fixed structure for the MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource, with customization limited to the input of unique identifiers (ID) and references (REF) when the templates are rendered.

Here's an example of how the device.hbs template structures its output:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "MedicinalProductPharmaceutical",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "device": [
      {
        "reference": "{{REF}}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

And similarly, for the ingredient.hbs template:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "MedicinalProductPharmaceutical",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "ingredient": [
      {
        "reference": "{{REF}}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Both templates expect two inputs:
1. ID: A string representing the unique identifier for the MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource.
2. REF: A string containing the reference to either the associated device or ingredient, depending on the template.

It's important to note that these templates provide a minimal structure for the MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource. In real-world scenarios, these resources might include additional properties and more complex structures. The current implementation is focused on creating a basic reference structure, either for a device or an ingredient.

The templates don't include error handling or conditional logic, assuming that both ID and REF will be provided when rendered. If multiple device or ingredient references are needed, the templates would need to be modified or used in a loop to generate multiple entries.

These templates are part of a larger FHIR conversion project, likely used in conjunction with other templates and processes that provide the necessary ID and REF values. They play a crucial role in standardizing pharmaceutical product data according to the FHIR specification, facilitating interoperability in healthcare information systems.
