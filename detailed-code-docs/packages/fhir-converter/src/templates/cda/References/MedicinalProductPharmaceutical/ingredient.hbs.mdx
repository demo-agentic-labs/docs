### MedicinalProductPharmaceutical Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure for a MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource in FHIR format. It includes an ingredient reference within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the ingredient resource |

#### Outputs
The template generates a JSON object representing a MedicinalProductPharmaceutical resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: Set to "MedicinalProductPharmaceutical"
- id: The unique identifier for the resource
- ingredient: An array containing a single object with a reference to the ingredient

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure. The `ingredient` array contains a single object with a `reference` field, which is populated with the `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options. The structure of the output is fixed, with only the `ID` and `REF` values being customizable through input.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it is part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be used within a FHIR conversion process, likely as part of a larger system for handling medical product data.
3. The structure of the template suggests that it's meant to be used in conjunction with other templates or processes that would provide the necessary `ID` and `REF` values.
4. The template only includes a single ingredient reference. If multiple ingredients need to be represented, the template would need to be modified or used in a loop to generate multiple ingredient entries.
