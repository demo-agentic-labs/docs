### Condition Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object for a FHIR Condition resource with a focus on the evidence detail. It includes placeholders for an ID and a reference within the evidence array.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Condition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting evidence detail |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant Condition resource with evidence detail |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Condition"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates an "evidence" array with one object
5. Within the evidence object, creates a "detail" array with one object
6. Sets the "reference" field of the detail object to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the Condition resource with placeholders for variable data.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Condition resource, focusing specifically on the evidence detail. It may be used as part of a larger template or system for generating complete FHIR resources.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for Condition resources, particularly the evidence element.
4. The template uses minimal formatting and whitespace, likely to reduce the size of the generated JSON output.
