### Condition Resource Template
#### Description

#### Inputs

| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Condition resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the asserter of the condition |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Condition resource with the `asserter` field populated.

#### Internal Logic

2. Inside the `resource`, it sets:
   - `resourceType` to "Condition"
   - `id` to the provided `{{ID}}`
   - `asserter` object with a `reference` property set to the provided `{{REF}}`

2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`) to insert dynamic values.
3. The output is a partial resource and may be combined with other templates to form a complete FHIR Condition resource.
