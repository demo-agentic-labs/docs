## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a FHIR Condition resource with an associated encounter reference. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format, specifically for linking a condition to an encounter.

### Condition Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Condition resource with an embedded encounter reference. The template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the encounter reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Condition resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Condition resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the Condition resource details
  - `resourceType`: Always set to "Condition"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Condition
  - `encounter`: An object containing the reference to the associated encounter

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Condition resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to insert dynamic values for the Condition's ID and the encounter reference.
3. The encounter is represented as an object with a single "reference" property, linking to the associated encounter.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for rendering.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this template serves as an interface for creating FHIR Condition resources with encounter references. It expects two inputs (`ID` and `REF`) and produces a JSON structure conforming to the FHIR Condition resource specification.
