## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of FHIR Condition resources. These templates are designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format, specifically for creating different aspects of Condition resources such as asserter, encounter, evidence, recorder, stage assessment, and subject references.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different components of a FHIR Condition resource. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the Condition resource:

1. The asserter template creates a reference to the person who asserted the condition.
2. The encounter template links a condition to a specific healthcare encounter.
3. The evidence detail template adds supporting information for the condition.
4. The recorder template indicates who recorded the condition in the patient's record.
5. The stage assessment template provides information about the stage of the condition.
6. The subject template sets the patient or group to which the condition applies.

When used in combination, these templates allow for the construction of comprehensive FHIR Condition resources from CDA data, capturing various aspects of a medical condition in a standardized format.

## Key Files
1. `asserter.hbs`: Creates the asserter field for a Condition resource.
2. `encounter.hbs`: Links a Condition to a specific encounter.
3. `evidence.detail.hbs`: Adds evidence details to a Condition.
4. `recorder.hbs`: Specifies who recorded the Condition.
5. `stage.assessment.hbs`: Provides stage assessment information for a Condition.
6. `subject.hbs`: Sets the subject (patient or group) for the Condition.

Each of these files generates a partial JSON structure that represents a specific part of a FHIR Condition resource. They are designed to be combined to create a complete Condition resource.

## Dependencies
These templates are part of the FHIR Converter project and rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to work within a larger system that handles the overall conversion process from CDA to FHIR format.

## Configuration
The templates don't include specific configuration options. Instead, they use Handlebars placeholders (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`) to allow for dynamic content insertion when the templates are rendered. The values for these placeholders are expected to be provided by the system using these templates during the conversion process.

Each template follows a similar structure:
1. A comprehensive copyright notice indicating the template is part of a project by Metriport Inc., based on work by Microsoft Corporation.
2. A JSON structure representing a part of a FHIR Condition resource.
3. Use of Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.

For example, the `subject.hbs` template looks like this:

```handlebars
{
    "resource":{
        "resourceType": "Condition",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
},
```

This structure allows for flexible and modular construction of FHIR Condition resources, enabling the conversion system to assemble complete resources by combining these partial templates as needed based on the input CDA data.
