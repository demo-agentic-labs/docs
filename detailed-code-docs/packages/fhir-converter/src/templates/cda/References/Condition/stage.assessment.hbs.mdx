### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Condition resource. The template focuses on the `stage` and `assessment` elements of the Condition resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Condition resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the assessment resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Condition resource with stage assessment |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Condition".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `stage` array with one object.
5. Within the stage object, creates an `assessment` array with one object.
6. Sets the `reference` property of the assessment object to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for dynamic content.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template generates a minimal Condition resource structure, focusing only on the `stage` and `assessment` elements. Other elements of a full Condition resource are not included.
3. The generated JSON structure is not a complete valid JSON object on its own, as it starts and ends with curly braces that are not part of a named object. This suggests that this template is likely meant to be used as part of a larger JSON structure or further processed after generation.
