## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR Condition resource structure, specifically focusing on the `recorder` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR Condition resource with a `recorder` field. The `recorder` field is used to indicate the person who recorded the condition in the patient's record.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Condition resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the recorder of the condition |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Condition resource with the `recorder` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "Condition".
3. It sets the `id` of the Condition using the `\{\{ID\}\}` input.
4. It creates a `recorder` object with a `reference` property, populated by the `\{\{REF\}\}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the input variables provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. Error management would likely be handled by the system using this template.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (\{\{...\}\}) for variable interpolation.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be part of a larger FHIR resource construction process.
4. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests this might be part of an array or a larger object in the full implementation.
