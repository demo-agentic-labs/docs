### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Condition resource. It specifically sets the `subject` field of the Condition resource, which is typically a reference to a Patient or Group resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Condition resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject (typically a Patient or Group) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A partial FHIR Condition resource with the subject reference set |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Condition".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the Condition resource.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, using the `REF` input to set its value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting clinical documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now part of a project by Metriport Inc., licensed under AGPLv3.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be merged with other parts of a Condition resource.
4. The trailing commas in the JSON structure suggest that this might be part of a larger object or array in the final output.
