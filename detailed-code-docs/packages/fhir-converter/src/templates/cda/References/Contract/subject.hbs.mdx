### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a subject array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the subject of the Contract |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Contract resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Contract"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `subject` array with a single object containing a `reference` field
4. Sets the `reference` value to the provided `REF`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure is not complete and appears to be part of a larger FHIR resource bundle, as indicated by the outer "resource" key.
3. The subject array is hardcoded to contain only one reference, which may limit flexibility if multiple subjects need to be represented.
4. The JSON structure includes trailing commas, which are not standard in JSON but are often accepted by modern parsers and may be intended for easier extension of the template.
