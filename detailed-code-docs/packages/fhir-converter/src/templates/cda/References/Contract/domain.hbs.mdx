### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a domain array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the domain |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Contract resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Contract"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `domain` array with a single object containing a `reference` field
4. The `reference` field is populated with the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of dynamic values for the Contract's ID and domain reference.
3. The structure follows the FHIR Contract resource specifications, focusing specifically on the domain attribute.
4. The template only includes a single domain reference. If multiple domain references are needed, the template would need to be modified to accommodate an array of references.
