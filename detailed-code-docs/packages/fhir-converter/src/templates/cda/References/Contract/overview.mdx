## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of FHIR Contract resources. These templates are designed to be used in a FHIR conversion system, specifically for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR resources.

## What does it do?
These templates create JSON structures representing different aspects of FHIR Contract resources. They allow for the dynamic generation of Contract resource components, such as authors, authorities, domains, legal references, signers, and more. Each template focuses on a specific part of the Contract resource, making it easy to compose complex Contract resources by combining these templates.

## Key Files
1. `author.hbs`: Generates a Contract resource with an author reference.
2. `authority.hbs`: Creates a Contract resource with an authority reference.
3. `domain.hbs`: Produces a Contract resource with a domain reference.
4. `legallyBindingReference.hbs`: Generates a Contract resource with a legally binding reference.
5. `signer.party.hbs`: Creates a Contract resource with a signer party reference.
6. `subject.hbs`: Produces a Contract resource with a subject reference.
7. `term.topicReference.hbs`: Generates a Contract resource with a term topic reference.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a partial FHIR Contract resource with specific fields populated based on input parameters.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely using other libraries and tools for the complete conversion process.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't have explicit configuration options, they use placeholders (typically {{ID}} and {{REF}}) that should be replaced with actual values when rendering the templates. These values would typically be provided by the conversion system using these templates.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates generate partial FHIR Contract resources, focusing on specific elements. They are designed to be flexible and composable, allowing for the creation of more complex Contract resources by combining multiple templates.
3. The generated JSON structures often include trailing commas, which might need to be handled in the final output to ensure valid JSON.
4. These templates are part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources, and they specifically handle the Contract resource type within that conversion process.
5. The templates don't include error handling or validation, assuming that the necessary data will be provided correctly when they are rendered.
