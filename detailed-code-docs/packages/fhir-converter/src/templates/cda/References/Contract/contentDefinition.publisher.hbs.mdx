### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource, specifically populating the `contentDefinition.publisher` field. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the publisher |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Contract resource with the `contentDefinition.publisher` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts with a JSON object containing a `resource` field.
2. Inside `resource`, it defines:
   - `resourceType` as "Contract"
   - `id` using the `{{ID}}` placeholder
   - `contentDefinition` object containing a `publisher` object
   - The `publisher` object has a `reference` field populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any explicit configuration options, but it uses two placeholders that should be provided when rendering the template:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID     | string | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF    | string | The reference value for the publisher |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Contract resource, likely to be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
3. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that this template is meant to be processed by a Handlebars template engine, with the actual values for ID and REF being provided at runtime.
