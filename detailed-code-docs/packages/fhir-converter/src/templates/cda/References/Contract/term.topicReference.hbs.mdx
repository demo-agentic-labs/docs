## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Contract resource with a specific structure focusing on the `term.topicReference` element. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a Contract resource with a single term and its associated topic reference.

### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Contract resource with a specific structure. It includes a single term with a topic reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the topic of the contract term |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Contract resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Contract"
  - `id`: Set to the provided `ID` value
  - `term`: An array with a single object containing:
    - `topicReference`: An object with a `reference` property set to the provided `REF` value

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the overall structure of the Contract resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Contract".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` of the resource.
4. It creates a `term` array with a single object.
5. Within the term object, it creates a `topicReference` object.
6. The `reference` property of `topicReference` is set to the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the input variables and generate the final JSON output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The structure is fixed, and the only customizable parts are the `ID` and `REF` inputs.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided and valid. If either is missing or invalid, it may result in an incomplete or invalid FHIR Contract resource.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from multiple parties.
2. The template is designed to be simple and focused, generating a specific part of a Contract resource. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to create more complex FHIR resources.
3. The use of double curly braces (`{{}}`) around `ID` and `REF` indicates that these are Handlebars variables that will be replaced with actual values when the template is rendered.
