## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial structure for a FHIR Contract resource, specifically focusing on the `signer` element. It creates a JSON object representing a Contract with a single signer, where the signer's party is referenced by a provided reference value.

### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template generates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource. It specifically defines the `signer` element within the Contract, which is an array containing a single object with a `party` property.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the party (typically a Patient or RelatedPerson resource) |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Contract resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the Contract resource details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Contract"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Contract
  - `signer`: An array containing a single object representing the signer
    - `party`: An object with a `reference` property pointing to the signing party

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses the `ID` input to set the `id` of the Contract resource.
2. It creates a `signer` array with a single object.
3. Within the signer object, it sets the `party.reference` using the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR conversion processes.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The structure is fixed, and the values are populated using the provided inputs.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents into FHIR resources.
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The structure provided is a partial Contract resource. In a complete FHIR Contract, there would typically be additional properties and potentially multiple signers.
- The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where Handlebars will interpolate values when rendering the template.
