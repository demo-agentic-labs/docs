### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Contract resource with a site reference. The resource includes an ID and a site array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the site |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR Contract resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a Contract resource with the specified ID.
2. It includes a site array with a single object containing a reference.
3. The reference value is populated using the provided REF input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a structure for generating a FHIR Contract resource. The generated JSON can be used as part of a FHIR API request or response.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | string | Always set to "Contract" |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the Contract resource |
