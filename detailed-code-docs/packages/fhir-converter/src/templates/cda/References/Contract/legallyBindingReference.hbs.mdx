### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Contract resource with a legallyBindingReference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the legally binding document or entity |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR Contract resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts with a copyright and license notice.
2. It then defines a JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource.
3. The resource type is set to "Contract".
4. The `id` field is populated with the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
5. The `legallyBindingReference` field is set with a nested object containing a `reference` field, populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The behavior is determined by the values provided for the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this template expects two inputs to be provided when rendered:

| Placeholder | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| {{ID}}      | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| {{REF}}     | The reference to the legally binding document or entity |

These placeholders should be replaced with actual values when the template is used to generate a FHIR Contract resource.
