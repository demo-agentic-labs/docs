## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Contract resource with an authority reference. It's designed to generate a JSON structure representing a Contract resource with a single authority reference.

### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource. It includes an `id` field and an `authority` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the authority |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Contract resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Contract".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the Contract's `id`.
4. It creates an `authority` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses two placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) that should be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. If the placeholders are not provided or are invalid, it may result in an incomplete or invalid JSON structure.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The generated JSON structure is not a complete FHIR resource; it's a partial structure that would typically be incorporated into a larger FHIR bundle or message.
3. The template uses a nested structure with `resource` as the top-level key, which suggests it might be designed to be part of a larger FHIR document or bundle.
4. The trailing commas in the JSON structure might cause issues with strict JSON parsers. Care should be taken when using this output to ensure it's valid JSON in the context where it's used.
