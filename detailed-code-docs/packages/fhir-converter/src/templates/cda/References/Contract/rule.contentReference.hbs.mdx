### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource. The template focuses on the `rule` array within the Contract resource, specifically adding a `contentReference` to the rule.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF | string | The reference value for the contentReference |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Contract resource with a rule containing a content reference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Contract".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `rule` array with a single object.
5. Within the rule object, creates a `contentReference` object with a `reference` property set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a part of a FHIR Converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR resources.
3. The generated JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the trailing commas and the nested structure.
