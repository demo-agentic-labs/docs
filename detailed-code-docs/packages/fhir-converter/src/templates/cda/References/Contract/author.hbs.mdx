### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a basic structure for a FHIR Contract resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and an author reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the author of the Contract |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR Contract resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Contract"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates an `author` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration variables:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID     | string | The identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF    | string | The reference to the author of the Contract |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template is part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents to FHIR resources.
3. The output JSON structure is nested within `resource` and `author` objects, which might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or message structure.
4. The template only includes minimal information for a Contract resource. In a full implementation, additional fields might be necessary to create a complete and valid FHIR Contract resource.
