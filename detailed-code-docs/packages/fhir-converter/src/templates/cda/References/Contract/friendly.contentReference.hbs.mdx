#### Inputs

| REF | String | The reference to another resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Contract"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "friendly" array with one object
5. Within the "friendly" object, creates a "contentReference" object with a "reference" property
6. Assigns the provided REF value to the "reference" property

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable interpolation.

## Configuration
The template uses two configuration options:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another resource |

## API/Interface Reference

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| {{ID}} | The unique identifier for the Contract resource |
| {{REF}} | The reference to another resource |

Note: This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and processing logic.
