## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Contract resource with an `instantiatesCanonical` field. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a Contract that references another canonical resource.

### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Contract resource with an `instantiatesCanonical` field. The Contract resource is used to define an agreement between parties, and the `instantiatesCanonical` field indicates that this Contract instantiates a canonical definition of a contract.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for this Contract resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the canonical resource that this Contract instantiates |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR Contract resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside the `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "Contract".
3. It sets the `id` of the Contract using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. It creates an `instantiatesCanonical` object with a `reference` property, set to the value of `{{REF}}`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license appears to be a combination of AGPL v3 (for Metriport's contributions) and a permissive license (for Microsoft's contributions).
3. The template is specifically designed for creating FHIR Contract resources that instantiate canonical definitions, which is a common pattern in FHIR for referencing standardized contract templates or definitions.
