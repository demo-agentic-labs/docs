## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR Contract resource with a relevantHistory field. It's designed to generate a JSON structure representing a Contract resource with a single relevant history reference.

### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource. It includes an `id` field and a `relevantHistory` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the relevant history |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Contract resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Contract".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `relevantHistory` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure is not complete and would typically be part of a larger FHIR resource or bundle.
3. The relevantHistory array is hardcoded to contain only one item. If multiple history references are needed, the template would need to be modified.
4. The comma after the closing bracket of the relevantHistory array might cause issues in strict JSON parsing and should be removed for valid JSON.
