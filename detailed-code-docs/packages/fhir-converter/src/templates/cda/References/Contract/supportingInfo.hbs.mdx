### Contract Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Contract resource. It includes an `id` field and a `supportingInfo` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Contract resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Contract resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Contract"
2. Sets the `id` of the Contract to the provided `{{ID}}`
3. Creates a `supportingInfo` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy modification or extension of the Contract resource structure if needed.
3. The `supportingInfo` array is currently set up to include only one reference, but could be easily modified to include multiple references if required.
