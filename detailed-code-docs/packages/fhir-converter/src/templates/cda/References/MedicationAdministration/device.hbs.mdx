### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a partial MedicationAdministration FHIR resource. It specifically populates the `device` field of the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the device used in the medication administration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A partial FHIR MedicationAdministration resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationAdministration".
3. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
4. It creates a `device` array with a single object containing a `reference` property set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is likely used in conjunction with other templates and helper functions to generate complete FHIR resources.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided and valid when the template is used.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion process. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` as inputs and produces a partial JSON structure that can be incorporated into a full MedicationAdministration resource.

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the device used in the medication administration |

The output is a JSON object representing a partial MedicationAdministration resource with the `device` field populated.
