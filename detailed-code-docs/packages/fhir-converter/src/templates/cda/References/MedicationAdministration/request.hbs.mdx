### MedicationAdministration Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationAdministration resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a request reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the related request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR MedicationAdministration resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationAdministration"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `request` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the MedicationAdministration resource.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is specifically designed for the `request` field of a MedicationAdministration resource, suggesting it might be part of a larger system for generating complete FHIR resources.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and seems to be a fragment, possibly meant to be combined with other parts to form a complete FHIR resource.
