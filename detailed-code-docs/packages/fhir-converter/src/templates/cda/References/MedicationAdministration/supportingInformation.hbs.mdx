## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicationAdministration resource structure, specifically focusing on the `supportingInformation` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### MedicationAdministration Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for a FHIR MedicationAdministration resource, specifically populating the `supportingInformation` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting information |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationAdministration resource with the `supportingInformation` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure for a FHIR resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationAdministration".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. In the `supportingInformation` array, it creates an object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of dynamic values (ID and REF) into the FHIR resource structure.
3. This template only defines a partial resource structure, focusing on the `supportingInformation` field. It's likely used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR MedicationAdministration resource.
4. The use of Handlebars (indicated by the `{{}}` syntax) suggests that this template is processed by a Handlebars engine, which will replace the placeholders with actual values during the conversion process.
