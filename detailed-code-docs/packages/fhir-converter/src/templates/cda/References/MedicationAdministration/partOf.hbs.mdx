### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a MedicationAdministration resource with a `partOf` field. The `partOf` field is used to reference other resources that this medication administration is part of.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for this MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another resource that this MedicationAdministration is part of |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A partial FHIR MedicationAdministration resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationAdministration".
3. It sets the `id` field using the `{{ID}}` input.
4. It creates a `partOf` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on other templates and helpers within the fhir-converter package.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses the FHIR standard for structuring healthcare data, specifically for medication administration events.
3. The `partOf` field in a MedicationAdministration resource is used to link this administration to other related resources, such as a procedure or an encounter.
4. This template appears to be a partial representation of a MedicationAdministration resource, focusing only on the `id` and `partOf` fields. In a complete FHIR resource, there would likely be additional fields.
