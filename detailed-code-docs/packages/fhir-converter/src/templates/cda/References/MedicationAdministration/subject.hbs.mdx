### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a MedicationAdministration resource, focusing on the `subject` field. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject of the medication administration |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial MedicationAdministration resource with the `subject` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationAdministration".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion framework, which may have its own configuration settings.

2. The template is specifically for the `subject` field of a MedicationAdministration resource, suggesting it's part of a larger set of templates for creating complete FHIR resources.
3. The use of Handlebars syntax ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) indicates that this template is meant to be processed by a Handlebars template engine, with the actual values for ID and REF being provided at runtime.
