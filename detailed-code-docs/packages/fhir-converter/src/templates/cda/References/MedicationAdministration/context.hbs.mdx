### MedicationAdministration Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicationAdministration resource. It specifically populates the `id` and `context` fields of the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the context in which the medication administration occurred |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationAdministration resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "MedicationAdministration".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It creates a `context` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR resource generation system.

## Error Handling
This template doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resource.resourceType | String | Always set to "MedicationAdministration" |
| resource.id | String | The unique identifier for this MedicationAdministration resource |
| resource.context.reference | String | A reference to the context of the medication administration |

Note: This template provides a partial representation of a MedicationAdministration resource, focusing only on the `id` and `context` fields. In a complete FHIR resource, additional fields would typically be present.
