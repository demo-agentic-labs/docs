## High-level description

### MedicationAdministration Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for a FHIR MedicationAdministration resource, specifically defining the `eventHistory` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | String | The reference to be included in the `eventHistory` array |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationAdministration resource with the `eventHistory` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MedicationAdministration".
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. Defines an `eventHistory` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field is populated with the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a MedicationAdministration resource, focusing only on the `eventHistory` field. It's likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
3. The structure allows for only one reference in the `eventHistory` array, which might be a limitation depending on the use case.
4. The template uses Handlebars syntax (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.
