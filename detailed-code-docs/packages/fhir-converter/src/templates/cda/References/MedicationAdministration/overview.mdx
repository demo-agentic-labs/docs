## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of a FHIR MedicationAdministration resource. These templates are designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific field or aspect of the MedicationAdministration resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR MedicationAdministration resource. They handle various aspects such as:

1. Setting the context of the medication administration
2. Specifying the device used for administration
3. Recording the event history
4. Referencing the medication being administered
5. Indicating if this administration is part of another procedure
6. Identifying the performer of the administration
7. Providing a reason for the administration
8. Linking to the original medication request
9. Specifying the subject (patient) of the administration
10. Including supporting information

Each template generates a JSON structure for its specific part of the MedicationAdministration resource. These structures can then be combined to form a complete FHIR resource.

## Key Files
1. `context.hbs`: Generates the `context` field, which references the encounter or episode of care during which the medication was administered.

2. `device.hbs`: Creates the `device` field, referencing any device used in the medication administration.

3. `eventHistory.hbs`: Populates the `eventHistory` field, which can link to other resources that provide information about the medication administration event.

4. `medicationReference.hbs`: Generates the `medicationReference` field, which points to the medication resource being administered.

5. `partOf.hbs`: Creates the `partOf` field, which can reference another resource that this medication administration is part of.

6. `performer.actor.hbs`: Populates the `performer.actor` field, identifying who performed the medication administration.

7. `reasonReference.hbs`: Generates the `reasonReference` field, which provides a reason for the medication administration.

8. `request.hbs`: Creates the `request` field, which links to the original medication request.

9. `subject.hbs`: Populates the `subject` field, referencing the patient receiving the medication.

10. `supportingInformation.hbs`: Generates the `supportingInformation` field, which can include additional relevant information about the administration.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely the fhir-converter package.

## Configuration
These templates don't include specific configuration options. They are designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars variables (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`), which are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered.

## Notes
1. Each template focuses on a specific part of the MedicationAdministration resource, allowing for modular construction of the complete resource.
2. The templates follow FHIR resource formatting guidelines, ensuring compatibility with FHIR-compliant systems.
3. Error handling is not explicitly implemented in these templates. It's assumed that error management is handled by the system using these templates.
4. The templates are designed to be part of a larger FHIR document construction process and would typically be combined to create a complete MedicationAdministration resource.
5. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating they are based on work by Microsoft but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
