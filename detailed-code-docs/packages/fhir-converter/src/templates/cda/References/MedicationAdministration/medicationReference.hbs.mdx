### MedicationAdministration Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR MedicationAdministration resource with a medicationReference. It's a partial template, likely to be used as part of a larger FHIR document construction process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the medication being administered |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR MedicationAdministration resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a "resource" object with "resourceType" set to "MedicationAdministration".
2. Sets the "id" field using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. Creates a "medicationReference" object with a "reference" field set to the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and content of the MedicationAdministration resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars variables ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. Error management would likely be handled by the system using this template.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template uses the FHIR R4 structure for MedicationAdministration, focusing only on the medicationReference field.
3. This is a partial template and would typically be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource or document.
4. The comma at the end of the JSON structure suggests this might be part of an array of resources in a larger FHIR bundle.
