## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy integration into a larger FHIR resource generation process.
3. The structure follows FHIR resource formatting guidelines, ensuring compatibility with FHIR-compliant systems.
4. This template focuses solely on the performer's actor information and would likely be combined with other templates to create a complete MedicationAdministration resource.
