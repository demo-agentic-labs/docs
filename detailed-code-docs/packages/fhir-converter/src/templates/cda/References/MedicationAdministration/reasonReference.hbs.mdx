### MedicationAdministration Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR MedicationAdministration resource structure, focusing on the `reasonReference` field. It's designed to be included as part of a larger FHIR document or resource compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the MedicationAdministration resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the reason for the medication administration |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR MedicationAdministration resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "MedicationAdministration".
2. It sets the `id` of the resource using the provided `{{ID}}` input.
3. The `reasonReference` field is an array containing a single object with a `reference` property, set to the provided `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of, for converting CDA to FHIR |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as-is within the FHIR converter system.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly by the calling system.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is specifically for the `reasonReference` field of a MedicationAdministration resource, suggesting it's part of a modular system where different aspects of FHIR resources are templated separately.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be merged with other parts of the MedicationAdministration resource in the full conversion process.
