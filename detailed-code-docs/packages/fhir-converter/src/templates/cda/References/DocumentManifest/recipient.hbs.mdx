## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR DocumentManifest resource structure, specifically focusing on the `recipient` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DocumentManifest resource, specifically populating the `id` and `recipient` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the DocumentManifest resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the recipient |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A partial FHIR DocumentManifest resource structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "DocumentManifest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the DocumentManifest.
4. It creates a `recipient` array with a single object containing a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It may depend on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, the use of uppercase placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}) suggests that these values are expected to be provided by the context in which this template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The structure suggests that this template is meant to be included as part of a larger FHIR resource compilation, as it only defines a partial resource structure.
3. The template follows the FHIR DocumentManifest resource structure, specifically for the `recipient` field, which is defined as an array of references to other resources.
