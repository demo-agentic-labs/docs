### DocumentManifest Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of a FHIR DocumentManifest resource, specifically focusing on the 'related' field. It creates a JSON object representing the resource with placeholders for dynamic values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the DocumentManifest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the related resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR DocumentManifest resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "DocumentManifest",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "related": [
            {
                "ref": {
                    "reference": "{{REF}}"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets the "resourceType" to "DocumentManifest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the "id" field.
4. In the "related" array, it creates an object with a "ref" field.
5. The "ref" object contains a "reference" field with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3.
- The template is designed to be a partial representation of a DocumentManifest resource, focusing specifically on the 'related' field. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to create a complete DocumentManifest resource.
- The use of Handlebars syntax ({{placeholders}}) allows for dynamic insertion of values when the template is rendered.
