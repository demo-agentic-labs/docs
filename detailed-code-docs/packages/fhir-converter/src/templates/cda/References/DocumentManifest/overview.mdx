## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various components of a FHIR DocumentManifest resource. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents into FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the DocumentManifest resource, such as author, content, recipient, related references, and subject.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different parts of a FHIR DocumentManifest resource. A DocumentManifest in FHIR is used to define a set of documents that are part of a single logical grouping. The templates in this directory allow for the creation of various elements within this resource:

1. The author template creates the structure for specifying who authored the document manifest.
2. The content template defines how to reference related documents or resources.
3. The recipient template structures the information about who should receive the document manifest.
4. The related reference template allows for linking to other related resources.
5. The subject template creates the structure for specifying the subject (usually a patient) of the document manifest.

When used in the conversion process, these templates take input data (likely from a CDA document) and format it into the appropriate FHIR JSON structure for a DocumentManifest resource.

## Key Files
1. `author.hbs`: Creates the author field of the DocumentManifest, specifying who created the manifest.
2. `content.hbs`: Defines the content field, which references the actual documents or resources included in the manifest.
3. `recipient.hbs`: Structures the recipient field, indicating who should receive the manifest.
4. `related.ref.hbs`: Creates the related field, allowing references to other related resources.
5. `subject.hbs`: Defines the subject field, typically referencing the patient to whom the manifest pertains.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:
- They define a partial FHIR DocumentManifest resource.
- They use placeholders (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`) for dynamic insertion of values.
- They output a JSON structure that represents a part of the DocumentManifest resource.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely with additional dependencies and infrastructure not visible in these individual files.

## Configuration
The templates themselves don't include explicit configuration options. Instead, they use placeholders (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`) which are expected to be filled with appropriate values when the templates are rendered. The behavior and output of these templates are determined by the values provided to these placeholders during the conversion process.

## Notes
1. These templates are part of a larger project that includes contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation, as indicated by the copyright notices.
2. The templates are designed to be flexible and reusable, focusing on specific parts of the DocumentManifest resource rather than creating the entire resource in one go.
3. The use of separate templates for different parts of the DocumentManifest allows for modular construction of the resource, which can be beneficial for maintaining and updating the conversion process.
4. While these templates provide the structure for a DocumentManifest resource, they would need to be used in conjunction with a data source (likely a CDA document) and additional logic to populate the placeholders with appropriate values.
5. The templates follow FHIR specifications for the DocumentManifest resource, ensuring that the output will be compatible with FHIR-compliant systems when properly populated.
