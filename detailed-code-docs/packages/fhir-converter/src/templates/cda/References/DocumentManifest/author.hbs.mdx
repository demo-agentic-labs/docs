## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR DocumentManifest resource structure, specifically focusing on the `author` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents to FHIR format.

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a partial FHIR DocumentManifest resource. It specifically populates the `id` and `author` fields of the DocumentManifest.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the DocumentManifest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the author of the document |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A partial FHIR DocumentManifest resource in JSON format |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure representing a FHIR DocumentManifest resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "DocumentManifest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the DocumentManifest.
4. It creates an `author` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`).

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template focuses only on the `author` field of a DocumentManifest resource, suggesting it might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete DocumentManifest.
3. The extensive copyright notice at the beginning indicates that this code is part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
4. The template uses a specific JSON structure that wraps the DocumentManifest in a `resource` object, which might be required by the larger system this template is part of.
