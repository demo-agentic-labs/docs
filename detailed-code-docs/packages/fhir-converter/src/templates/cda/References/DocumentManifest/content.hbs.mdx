### DocumentManifest Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DocumentManifest resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a content array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the DocumentManifest resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the related document or resource |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR DocumentManifest resource with the following structure:
- resourceType: "DocumentManifest"
- id: The provided ID
- content: An array containing a single object with a 'reference' field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts by defining the resource type as "DocumentManifest".
2. It sets the 'id' field using the provided `{{ID}}` value.
3. In the 'content' array, it includes a single object with a 'reference' field, populated by the `{{REF}}` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template. The structure is fixed, with only the ID and reference values being customizable through input variables.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure provided is a basic representation of a DocumentManifest. In a real-world scenario, you might need to expand this template to include additional fields or multiple content references, depending on the specific requirements of your FHIR implementation.
3. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for variable substitution, which is standard Handlebars syntax.
