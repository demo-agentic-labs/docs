### DocumentManifest Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR DocumentManifest resource structure with a subject reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the DocumentManifest resource |
| REF | string | The reference value for the subject of the DocumentManifest |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR DocumentManifest resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "DocumentManifest"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `subject`: An object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR DocumentManifest resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "DocumentManifest".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to insert the provided ID into the `id` field.
4. It creates a `subject` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder to insert the provided reference value.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is used to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from multiple parties.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a DocumentManifest resource. It likely needs to be combined with other templates or data to create a complete FHIR resource.
3. The output JSON is not a complete, valid FHIR resource on its own. It's structured to be part of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the comma at the end of the template.
4. Care should be taken to ensure that the `ID` and `REF` values provided when rendering this template are valid according to FHIR specifications.
