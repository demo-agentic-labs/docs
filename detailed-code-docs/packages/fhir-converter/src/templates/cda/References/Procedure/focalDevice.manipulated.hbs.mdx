## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a FHIR Procedure resource with a focus on the `focalDevice` element. It specifically structures the `manipulated` property within the `focalDevice` array, providing a reference to a manipulated device used in the procedure.

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource, specifically focusing on the `focalDevice` element. It creates a single `focalDevice` entry with a `manipulated` property that references another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the manipulated device |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Procedure resource focusing on the `focalDevice` element |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "Procedure".
2. Sets the `id` of the Procedure resource using the `{{ID}}` input.
3. Defines a `focalDevice` array with a single object.
4. Within the `focalDevice` object, creates a `manipulated` property with a `reference` set to the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses standard Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license by Metriport Inc.
2. The generated JSON structure is partial and would typically be combined with other elements to form a complete FHIR Procedure resource.
3. The template focuses solely on the `focalDevice` element of a Procedure resource, specifically the `manipulated` property within it.
4. The structure allows for easy expansion to include multiple `focalDevice` entries if needed in the future, as it's defined as an array.
