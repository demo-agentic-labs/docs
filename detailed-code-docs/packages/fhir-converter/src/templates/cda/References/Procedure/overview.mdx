## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of FHIR Procedure resources. These templates are designed to be used in a system that converts Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect or field of a Procedure resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of FHIR Procedure resources. They allow for the dynamic insertion of data such as identifiers, references to other resources, and specific procedure details. When combined, these templates can generate complete FHIR Procedure resources that describe medical procedures, including information about who performed them, why they were done, what was used, and other relevant details.

## Key Files
1. `asserter.hbs`: Generates the `asserter` field, indicating who confirmed the procedure.
2. `basedOn.hbs`: Creates the `basedOn` field, referencing other resources this procedure is based on.
3. `complicationDetail.hbs`: Populates the `complicationDetail` field with references to complications.
4. `encounter.hbs`: Links the procedure to a specific encounter.
5. `focalDevice.manipulated.hbs`: Describes devices manipulated during the procedure.
6. `location.hbs`: Specifies where the procedure took place.
7. `partOf.hbs`: Indicates if this procedure is part of a larger procedure.
8. `performer.actor.hbs` and `performer.onBehalfOf.hbs`: Detail who performed the procedure and on whose behalf.
9. `reasonReference.hbs`: Provides references to the reason for the procedure.
10. `recorder.hbs`: Specifies who recorded the procedure information.
11. `report.hbs`: Links to reports associated with the procedure.
12. `subject.hbs`: Identifies the subject (patient) of the procedure.
13. `usedReference.hbs`: References items used in the procedure.

Each of these templates generates a specific part of a FHIR Procedure resource, allowing for flexible and modular resource construction.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely including other templates and helper functions not visible in this directory.

## Configuration
The templates don't include specific configuration options. They are designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system where their usage and input data would be configured.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating they are part of a project by Metriport Inc., incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation, under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The templates use Handlebars syntax for variable substitution, typically expecting `ID` and `REF` inputs.
3. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of a Procedure resource, allowing for modular construction of complete resources.
4. The generated JSON structures are often partial and meant to be combined with other parts to form complete FHIR Procedure resources.
5. The templates follow FHIR specifications for Procedure resources, ensuring compatibility with FHIR standards.
6. Error handling is not explicitly implemented in these templates, assuming correct input will be provided during rendering.
