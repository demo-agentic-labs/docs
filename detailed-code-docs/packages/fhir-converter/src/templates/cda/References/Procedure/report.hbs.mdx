### Procedure Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource. It includes an ID and a report reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated report |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Procedure resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "Procedure"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `report` array with a single object containing a `reference` field
4. The `reference` field is populated with the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input variables (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger FHIR resource bundle or document.
3. The template uses double curly braces `{{}}` for variable substitution, which is standard Handlebars syntax.
4. The `report` field is an array, suggesting that multiple reports could potentially be associated with a procedure, although this template only includes one.
