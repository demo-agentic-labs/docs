## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a FHIR Procedure resource structure with a focus on the performer's "onBehalfOf" reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

## Symbols

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource, specifically focusing on the performer's "onBehalfOf" reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF  | String | The reference value for the performer's "onBehalfOf" field |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing a FHIR Procedure resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Procedure".
3. Assigns the input `ID` to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "performer" array with a single object.
5. Within the performer object, sets an "onBehalfOf" object with a "reference" property using the input `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this template. It assumes that the required input variables (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the "performer.onBehalfOf" part of a Procedure resource, suggesting it might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete Procedure resource.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for Procedure resources, focusing on the performer's organization reference.
4. The template uses minimal Handlebars syntax, only utilizing simple variable substitution (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`).
