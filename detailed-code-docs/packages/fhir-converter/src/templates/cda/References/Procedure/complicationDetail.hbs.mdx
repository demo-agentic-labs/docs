### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource, specifically populating the `complicationDetail` field with a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the complication detail resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Procedure resource with complication details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Procedure".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `complicationDetail` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. Sets the `reference` field to the provided `REF` value.

## Notes
- This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.
- The template focuses solely on the `complicationDetail` field of a Procedure resource, suggesting it's meant to be used in conjunction with other templates that populate other fields of the Procedure resource.
- The structure allows for only one complication detail reference, but the FHIR specification allows for multiple. If multiple complications need to be represented, the template would need to be modified to accept and iterate over multiple references.
