## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Procedure resource with a focus on the location field. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR resource generation process, specifically for mapping location information within a Procedure resource.

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Procedure resource. It specifically populates the `location` field of the Procedure resource with a reference to another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the location resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Procedure resource with location information |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Procedure".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. It creates a `location` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger templating system where `ID` and `REF` values are provided dynamically.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of the Metriport Inc. project but incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically tailored for the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its file path.
3. This template represents only a partial Procedure resource. In a complete FHIR resource, there would typically be additional fields and possibly nested resources.
4. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates where dynamic content should be inserted when the template is processed.
