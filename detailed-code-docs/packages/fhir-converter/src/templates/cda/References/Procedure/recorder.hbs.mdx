### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Procedure resource. It specifically populates the `recorder` field of the Procedure resource, which indicates the person who recorded the procedure information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the person who recorded the procedure |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A partial FHIR Procedure resource with the `recorder` field populated |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Procedure".
3. It uses the `ID` input to set the `id` field of the Procedure resource.
4. It creates a `recorder` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is specifically designed for use with Handlebars templating engine.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be combined with other partial resources to form a complete FHIR Procedure resource.
4. The trailing commas in the JSON structure suggest that this might be part of a larger JSON object or array.
