### Procedure Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource, focusing on the reasonReference field. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and the reference to the reason for the procedure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource explaining the reason for the procedure |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Procedure resource with reasonReference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Procedure"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates a "reasonReference" array with a single object containing a "reference" field
5. Inserts the provided REF value into the "reference" field

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation but is now under the AGPLv3 license by Metriport Inc.
2. The structure follows the FHIR specification for a Procedure resource, specifically focusing on the reasonReference field.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of the Procedure ID and the reference to the reason for the procedure.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and might be part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource collection.
