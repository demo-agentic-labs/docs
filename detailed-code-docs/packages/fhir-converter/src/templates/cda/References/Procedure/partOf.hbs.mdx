### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource with a `partOf` field. The `partOf` field is used to indicate that this procedure is part of another procedure or event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the parent procedure or event |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A FHIR Procedure resource with `partOf` field |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Procedure".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `partOf` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. Sets the `reference` value to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for variable substitution and rendering.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under AGPLv3.
- The `partOf` field is an array, suggesting that a procedure could potentially be part of multiple parent procedures or events, although this template only includes one reference.
- The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger FHIR resource bundle or document.
