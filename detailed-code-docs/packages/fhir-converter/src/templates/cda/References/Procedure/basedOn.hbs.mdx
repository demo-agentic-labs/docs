## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR Procedure resource structure, specifically focusing on the `basedOn` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource, specifically populating the `basedOn` field. The `basedOn` field is used to reference other resources that this procedure is based on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the resource this procedure is based on |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Procedure resource with the `basedOn` field populated.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets:
   - `resourceType` to "Procedure"
   - `id` to the provided `{{ID}}`
   - `basedOn` as an array with a single object containing a `reference` property set to `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, so its usage might be configured in other parts of the system.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be properly provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API but rather provides a partial structure that's likely used as part of a larger FHIR resource construction process.
