### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Procedure resource. It specifically populates the `id` and `subject` fields of the Procedure resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject of the procedure |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A partial FHIR Procedure resource with `id` and `subject` fields |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` of the resource to "Procedure".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the Procedure resource.
4. Creates a `subject` object with a `reference` property, setting its value to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It's designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR conversion process.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure is partial and would likely be combined with other data to form a complete FHIR Procedure resource.
3. The template follows the FHIR standard for representing a Procedure resource, specifically focusing on the subject reference.
4. This template is likely part of a larger set of templates used for converting various aspects of CDA documents to FHIR format.
