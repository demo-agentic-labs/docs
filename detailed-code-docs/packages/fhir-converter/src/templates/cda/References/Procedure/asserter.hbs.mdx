### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure representing part of a FHIR Procedure resource. It specifically focuses on the `asserter` field of the Procedure resource.

#### Inputs

| REF | string | The reference to the asserter of the procedure |

#### Outputs

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Sets the `resourceType` of the resource to "Procedure".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field of the Procedure resource.
4. Creates an `asserter` object with a `reference` field, setting its value to the provided `REF`.
