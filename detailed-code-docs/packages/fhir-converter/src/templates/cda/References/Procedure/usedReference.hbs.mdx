### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource with a `usedReference` field. It uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | string | The reference value to be included in the `usedReference` field |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Procedure resource with a `usedReference` field |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "Procedure".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the Procedure resource.
4. It creates a `usedReference` array with a single object containing a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure with the provided input values.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The behavior is determined by the input values provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project with contributions from both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy insertion of dynamic values for the Procedure ID and reference.
3. The JSON structure is formatted with extra commas at the end of some lines, which might be intentional for easier addition of new fields in the future, but it's worth noting that this is not standard JSON formatting.
4. The template only includes the `usedReference` field of a Procedure resource. In a real-world scenario, a Procedure resource would typically include additional fields such as status, code, subject, etc.
