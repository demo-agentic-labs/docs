### Procedure Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR Procedure resource. It includes an `id` field and an `encounter` field with a reference to the associated encounter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant Procedure resource JSON object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a `resource` property
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Procedure"
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
4. Creates an `encounter` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is specifically designed for use in a FHIR converter, likely part of a larger system for transforming clinical data into FHIR-compliant formats.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the trailing commas.
