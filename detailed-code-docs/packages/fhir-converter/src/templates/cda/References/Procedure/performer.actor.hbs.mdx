## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Procedure resource structure, specifically focusing on the performer's actor information. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

## Symbols

### Unnamed Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Procedure resource with a focus on the performer's actor information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Procedure resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the actor performing the procedure |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON structure | Object | A partial FHIR Procedure resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Procedure resource.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Procedure".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates a `performer` array with a single object.
5. Within the performer object, creates an `actor` object with a `reference` field set to the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on other templates or helper functions not visible in this file.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax, as evidenced by the use of `{{}}` for variable interpolation.
3. The structure follows the FHIR Procedure resource format, but only includes the `performer.actor` information, suggesting it's meant to be combined with other partial templates to create a complete Procedure resource.
4. The JSON structure is not complete and would likely be invalid if used as-is. It's meant to be a part of a larger JSON object.
