## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various components of FHIR resources, specifically focusing on references to other resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, designed to transform Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data into FHIR format. The templates cover a wide range of FHIR resources, from Account to VisionPrescription, and are organized into subdirectories for each resource type.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create standardized JSON structures representing different aspects of FHIR resources. They allow for the dynamic generation of resource components with references to other resources, which is crucial for maintaining relationships and links between different healthcare data elements in the FHIR format. 

The templates handle various types of references, such as:
1. Subject references (e.g., patient, practitioner)
2. Context references (e.g., encounter, episode of care)
3. Related resource references (e.g., based on, part of)
4. Actor references (e.g., performer, requester)
5. Location and organization references
6. Reason and outcome references

By using these templates, the FHIR converter can create complex, interconnected FHIR resources that accurately represent the relationships present in the original CDA data.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual resource subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains templates specific to a particular FHIR resource type. For example:

- `Account/`: Templates for Account resource references
- `Condition/`: Templates for Condition resource references
- `Encounter/`: Templates for Encounter resource references
- `Patient/`: Templates for Patient resource references

Developers would typically use these templates as part of a larger conversion process, selecting the appropriate template based on the resource type and specific reference needed.

## Key Files
While all files in this directory are important for their respective resources, some key files that demonstrate the general pattern include:

1. `Patient/subject.hbs`: A common template used across many resources to reference a patient.
2. `Encounter/encounter.hbs`: Used to link resources to specific healthcare encounters.
3. `Organization/managingOrganization.hbs`: Used to reference managing organizations in various resources.
4. `Practitioner/performer.hbs`: Used to reference practitioners performing actions in different contexts.

These files showcase the typical structure and usage pattern of the reference templates across different resource types.

## Dependencies
These templates primarily depend on:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating JSON structures | Not specified |

Handlebars is used to process the templates and insert dynamic values into the predefined JSON structures.

## Configuration
While individual templates don't have specific configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of input variables, typically:

1. `ID`: A unique identifier for the resource being created.
2. `REF`: A reference to another resource.

These variables are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered, allowing for dynamic content insertion based on the specific data being converted.

The actual configuration and orchestration of these templates would be handled by the larger FHIR converter system, which would determine which templates to use and how to populate them based on the input CDA data.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of templates for generating references within FHIR resources. These templates play a crucial role in the CDA to FHIR conversion process, ensuring that the complex relationships between healthcare data elements are accurately represented in the resulting FHIR resources.
