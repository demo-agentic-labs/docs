### Practitioner Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR Practitioner resource with a qualification issuer. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the Practitioner's ID and the reference to the qualification issuer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Practitioner resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the qualification issuer |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Practitioner resource with a qualification issuer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a Practitioner resource structure
2. Sets the resourceType to "Practitioner"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the resource
4. Creates a qualification array with a single element
5. Within the qualification, sets the issuer with a reference to the provided REF value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the dynamic content.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses two variables (ID and REF) that should be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project (likely related to FHIR conversion) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a Practitioner resource, focusing specifically on the qualification issuer. It may be used as part of a larger template or combined with other data to create a complete Practitioner resource.
3. The structure follows the FHIR specification for Practitioner resources, specifically the qualification and issuer elements.
4. The template uses minimal formatting and nesting to represent the JSON structure, which is common in template files to improve readability and maintainability.
