### MedicinalProductPackaged Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a MedicinalProductPackaged resource, which is part of the FHIR standard. It includes basic information about the packaged medicinal product, specifically the manufacturer details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProductPackaged resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the manufacturer |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing a MedicinalProductPackaged FHIR resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" key.
2. Inside the resource, it sets the "resourceType" to "MedicinalProductPackaged".
3. It assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. It creates a "packageItem" array with a single object.
5. Within the packageItem object, it creates a "manufacturer" array with a single object.
6. The manufacturer object contains a "reference" field, which is set to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The structure of the JSON object follows the FHIR specification for MedicinalProductPackaged resources.
3. This template appears to be a partial representation of a MedicinalProductPackaged resource, focusing only on the manufacturer information. In a complete FHIR resource, there might be additional fields and nested structures.
