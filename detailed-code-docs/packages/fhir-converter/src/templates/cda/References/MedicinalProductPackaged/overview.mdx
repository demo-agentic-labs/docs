## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) resources of type MedicinalProductPackaged. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect or property of the MedicinalProductPackaged resource.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a MedicinalProductPackaged FHIR resource. They allow for the flexible generation of various components of the resource, such as manufacturer information, marketing authorization, package items (including devices and manufactured items), and subject references. When used in combination, these templates can produce a complete MedicinalProductPackaged resource tailored to specific needs.

## Key Files
1. `manufacturer.hbs`: Creates a partial resource with manufacturer information.
2. `marketingAuthorization.hbs`: Generates a resource structure with marketing authorization details.
3. `packageItem.device.hbs`: Produces a resource with a package item containing a device reference.
4. `packageItem.manufacturedItem.hbs`: Creates a resource focusing on the manufactured item within a package item.
5. `packageItem.manufacturer.hbs`: Generates a resource structure with manufacturer information for a specific package item.
6. `subject.hbs`: Produces a partial resource with a subject reference.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure, creating a JSON object with the "MedicinalProductPackaged" resource type and specific properties relevant to their focus area.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, which would provide the necessary context and input data for rendering the templates.

## Configuration
The templates use simple placeholder variables (typically `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) which should be replaced with actual values when the templates are rendered. There are no explicit configuration options within the templates themselves. The configuration and data input would be managed by the larger system using these templates.

Here's an example of how the `manufacturer.hbs` template is structured:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicinalProductPackaged",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "manufacturer": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This structure is similar across all templates, with variations in the specific properties included (e.g., `marketingAuthorization`, `packageItem`, `subject`).

The templates are designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for the creation of different parts of a MedicinalProductPackaged resource as needed. They can be combined or used individually to generate the required FHIR resource structure based on the input data and the specific requirements of the conversion process.
