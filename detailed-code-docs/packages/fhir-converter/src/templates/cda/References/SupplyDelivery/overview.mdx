## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various aspects of FHIR SupplyDelivery resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed to transform CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents into FHIR-compliant resources. Each template focuses on a specific element or reference within the SupplyDelivery resource structure.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON representations of FHIR SupplyDelivery resources. They allow for the dynamic generation of different parts of a SupplyDelivery resource, such as:

1. The base resource structure with an ID
2. References to related resources (basedOn, partOf)
3. Patient information
4. Destination and supplier details
5. Receiver information
6. Supplied item references

By using these templates, developers can flexibly construct SupplyDelivery resources based on input data, likely derived from CDA documents. This modular approach allows for easy customization and maintenance of the FHIR conversion process.

## Key Files
1. `basedOn.hbs`: Creates a SupplyDelivery resource with a `basedOn` reference, indicating the resource this supply delivery is based on.

2. `destination.hbs`: Generates a SupplyDelivery resource with a `destination` reference, specifying where the supplies are to be delivered.

3. `partOf.hbs`: Produces a SupplyDelivery resource with a `partOf` reference, showing that this supply delivery is part of another resource.

4. `patient.hbs`: Creates a SupplyDelivery resource with a `patient` reference, linking the supply delivery to a specific patient.

5. `receiver.hbs`: Generates a SupplyDelivery resource with a `receiver` reference, indicating who receives the supplies.

6. `suppliedItem.itemReference.hbs`: Produces a SupplyDelivery resource with a `suppliedItem.itemReference`, referencing the item being supplied.

7. `supplier.hbs`: Creates a SupplyDelivery resource with a `supplier` reference, specifying who is supplying the items.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "SupplyDelivery",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "specificElement": {
      "reference": "{{REF}}"
    }
  }
}
```

Where `specificElement` is replaced by the relevant FHIR SupplyDelivery element (e.g., `basedOn`, `destination`, `patient`, etc.), and `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` are placeholders for dynamic values.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely integrated with other components that handle the actual data transformation and template rendering.

## Configuration
The templates themselves do not include specific configuration options. They use predefined placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) for data insertion. The configuration and data mapping would be handled by the broader FHIR conversion system that utilizes these templates.

## Notes
1. All templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but are now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.

2. The JSON structures in these templates are not always strictly valid, as they contain trailing commas. This might be intentional if the templates are part of a larger structure or if the parsing environment allows for relaxed JSON syntax.

3. These templates represent partial SupplyDelivery resources, focusing on specific elements. They are likely designed to be combined or used selectively to build complete SupplyDelivery resources based on the available data from CDA documents.

4. The modular nature of these templates allows for flexibility in constructing SupplyDelivery resources, as different combinations can be used depending on the available data and specific requirements of the conversion process.

5. Error handling is not explicitly implemented in these templates. It's assumed that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided correctly by the system using these templates.

6. The templates are specifically designed for the FHIR SupplyDelivery resource, which is part of the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard, focusing on representing the delivery of supplies to a destination.
