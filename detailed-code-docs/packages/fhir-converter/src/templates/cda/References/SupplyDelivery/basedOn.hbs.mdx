### SupplyDelivery Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource with an ID and a `basedOn` reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the SupplyDelivery resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource this SupplyDelivery is based on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `resource` object with `resourceType` set to "SupplyDelivery"
2. Sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` input
3. Defines a `basedOn` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to `{{REF}}`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for dynamic content.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.
