### SupplyDelivery Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a destination reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the SupplyDelivery resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the destination of the supply delivery |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON representation of a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "SupplyDelivery"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `destination` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the SupplyDelivery resource.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system. It expects to be called with context providing values for ID and REF. The output is a JSON object that can be incorporated into a larger FHIR bundle or used standalone as a SupplyDelivery resource.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | String | Always set to "SupplyDelivery" |
| id | String | Unique identifier for the SupplyDelivery resource |
| destination.reference | String | Reference to the destination of the supply delivery |
