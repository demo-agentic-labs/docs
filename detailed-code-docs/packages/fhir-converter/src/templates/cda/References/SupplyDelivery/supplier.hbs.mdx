### SupplyDelivery Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON object for a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a supplier reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the SupplyDelivery resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supplier |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A FHIR-compliant SupplyDelivery resource JSON object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "SupplyDelivery"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `supplier` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for data insertion.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The license is AGPLv3, as mentioned in the header comments.
3. The template is specifically designed for the supplier information within a SupplyDelivery resource, which is part of the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard.
4. The JSON structure is nested, with the main SupplyDelivery resource contained within a "resource" object. This structure might be part of a larger FHIR bundle or response format.
