## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource, specifically focusing on the patient reference. It's designed to generate a JSON representation of a SupplyDelivery resource with a patient reference.

### SupplyDelivery Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the SupplyDelivery resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this supply delivery |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "SupplyDelivery"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for data insertion.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The generated JSON structure is not complete and appears to be a fragment of a larger JSON object, as indicated by the trailing commas and the nested structure.
3. This template focuses solely on the patient reference within a SupplyDelivery resource and doesn't include other potential fields that might be part of a complete SupplyDelivery resource in FHIR.
