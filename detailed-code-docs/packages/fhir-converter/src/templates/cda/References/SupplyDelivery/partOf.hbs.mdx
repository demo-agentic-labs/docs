### SupplyDelivery Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource. It includes an 'id' field and a 'partOf' array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the SupplyDelivery resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the resource that this SupplyDelivery is part of |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | object | A FHIR-compliant SupplyDelivery resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a 'resource' object with 'resourceType' set to "SupplyDelivery"
2. Sets the 'id' field using the provided {{ID}} input
3. Creates a 'partOf' array with a single object containing a 'reference' field set to the provided {{REF}} input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Notes
- The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
- The JSON structure is not closed with a final curly brace, suggesting this template might be part of a larger structure or meant to be combined with other templates.
- The 'partOf' array is structured to allow for multiple references, but this template only includes one. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified.
