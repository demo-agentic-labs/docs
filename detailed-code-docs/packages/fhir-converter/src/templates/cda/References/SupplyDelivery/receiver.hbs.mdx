### SupplyDelivery Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource, emphasizing the receiver field. It uses Handlebars syntax to inject dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the SupplyDelivery resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the receiver of the supply delivery |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR SupplyDelivery resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "SupplyDelivery".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "receiver" array with a single object containing a "reference" property.
5. Sets the "reference" value to the provided REF input.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the JSON structure with dynamic values.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided correctly.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The JSON structure is not strictly valid as it contains trailing commas, which are not allowed in standard JSON. This might be intentional if the template is part of a larger structure or if the parsing environment allows for relaxed JSON syntax.
3. The template creates a nested structure with "resource" as the top-level key, which might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or a specific formatting requirement.
