### ImmunizationRecommendation Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an ImmunizationRecommendation resource with a single recommendation containing a supportingImmunization reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the ImmunizationRecommendation resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the supporting immunization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A structured JSON object representing an ImmunizationRecommendation resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an outer object with a "resource" key.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "ImmunizationRecommendation".
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "recommendation" array with a single object.
5. Within the recommendation object, creates a "supportingImmunization" array with a single object.
6. Sets the "reference" field of the supportingImmunization object to the provided REF value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the ImmunizationRecommendation resource.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the ID and REF values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This template does not define an API but rather provides a structure for generating a FHIR ImmunizationRecommendation resource. The generated JSON can be used as part of a FHIR API response or request body.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resource.resourceType | String | Always set to "ImmunizationRecommendation" |
| resource.id | String | Unique identifier for the resource |
| resource.recommendation[0].supportingImmunization[0].reference | String | Reference to the supporting immunization |
