#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |

#### Internal Logic

2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field containing the provided `REF` value

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses predefined placeholders for ID and patient reference.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.
