## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR ImmunizationRecommendation resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter project, specifically focusing on transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format. The templates in this directory define various components of an ImmunizationRecommendation resource, including authority, patient reference, supporting immunization, and supporting patient information.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of ImmunizationRecommendation resources in FHIR format. They allow for the conversion of immunization recommendation data from CDA format to FHIR, ensuring interoperability and standardization of health information. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the ImmunizationRecommendation resource:

1. The authority template defines the reference to the authority responsible for the recommendation.
2. The patient template sets up the patient reference within the resource.
3. The recommendation.supportingImmunization template creates a structure for referencing supporting immunization data.
4. The recommendation.supportingPatientInformation template establishes a reference to supporting patient information.

When used in conjunction with a templating engine like Handlebars, these templates can dynamically generate FHIR-compliant JSON structures based on input data, facilitating the transformation of CDA documents into FHIR resources.

## Key Files
1. `authority.hbs`: Defines the structure for the authority reference in an ImmunizationRecommendation resource.
2. `patient.hbs`: Creates the patient reference structure within the ImmunizationRecommendation.
3. `recommendation.supportingImmunization.hbs`: Establishes the structure for referencing supporting immunization data.
4. `recommendation.supportingPatientInformation.hbs`: Sets up the reference to supporting patient information.

Each of these files contributes to different aspects of the ImmunizationRecommendation resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource construction.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. No specific versions are mentioned in the provided summaries, but it's crucial to ensure compatibility with the version of Handlebars used in the broader FHIR converter project.

## Configuration
The templates themselves do not include specific configuration options. They use a fixed structure for the ImmunizationRecommendation resource, with placeholders for dynamic content such as IDs and references. The configuration for these templates likely resides in the broader FHIR converter project settings, which would determine how these templates are applied and what data is passed to them.

Here's an example of how the `authority.hbs` template structures an ImmunizationRecommendation resource:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "ImmunizationRecommendation",
  "id": "{{ID}}",
  "authority": {
    "reference": "{{REF}}"
  }
}
```

This structure is consistent across the templates, with variations in the specific fields populated (e.g., `patient`, `recommendation.supportingImmunization`, `recommendation.supportingPatientInformation`).

It's important to note that these templates are designed to be used as part of a larger system. They don't handle data validation, error checking, or complex logic on their own. Instead, they provide a standardized way to structure FHIR ImmunizationRecommendation resources, relying on the broader FHIR converter system to manage data flow, validation, and error handling.

This licensing information is crucial for understanding the terms under which these templates can be used, modified, and distributed as part of the FHIR converter project.
