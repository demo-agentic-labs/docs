## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) MedicinalProductContraindication resources. These templates are part of a larger system, likely for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the MedicinalProductContraindication resource, allowing for modular and flexible resource generation.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of MedicinalProductContraindication resources in FHIR format. They allow for the dynamic generation of different parts of the resource, such as:

1. Other therapy information, specifically medication references
2. Subject information
3. Therapeutic indication references

By using these templates, developers can easily generate standardized FHIR resources with specific data inserted into predefined structures. This approach ensures consistency in the generated resources while allowing for flexibility in the data that can be included.

## Key Files
1. `otherTherapy.medicationReference.hbs`: This template generates the `otherTherapy` section of the MedicinalProductContraindication resource, focusing on medication references.

2. `subject.hbs`: This template creates the `subject` section of the resource, allowing for the inclusion of references to the subject of the contraindication.

3. `therapeuticIndication.hbs`: This template produces the `therapeuticIndication` section of the resource, enabling the inclusion of references to therapeutic indications.

Each of these templates contributes to different aspects of the MedicinalProductContraindication resource, allowing for modular construction of the complete resource.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine for processing and rendering. No specific versions are mentioned in the provided summaries, but it's crucial to ensure compatibility with the version of Handlebars being used in the project.

## Configuration
While these templates don't have explicit configuration options, they do use placeholders for dynamic content:

- `{{ID}}`: Used in all templates to set the unique identifier for the MedicinalProductContraindication resource.
- `{{REF}}`: Used in different contexts across the templates:
  - In `otherTherapy.medicationReference.hbs`: References the medication
  - In `subject.hbs`: References the subject of the contraindication
  - In `therapeuticIndication.hbs`: References the therapeutic indication

These placeholders should be populated with appropriate values when rendering the templates.

Here's an example of how the `otherTherapy.medicationReference.hbs` template might be used:

```handlebars
{{&gt; MedicinalProductContraindication/otherTherapy.medicationReference ID="contraindication123" REF="Medication/med456"}}
```

This would generate a JSON structure like:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "MedicinalProductContraindication",
    "id": "contraindication123",
    "otherTherapy": [
      {
        "medicationReference": {
          "reference": "Medication/med456"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

It's important to note that these templates are designed to be partial representations of a MedicinalProductContraindication resource. They would typically be used in conjunction with other templates or within a larger system to build complete FHIR resources.

The modular nature of these templates allows for easy maintenance and updates to specific parts of the resource structure without affecting the entire resource generation process. This approach also promotes reusability, as these templates can be combined in different ways to create various representations of MedicinalProductContraindication resources based on the specific needs of the application or conversion process.
