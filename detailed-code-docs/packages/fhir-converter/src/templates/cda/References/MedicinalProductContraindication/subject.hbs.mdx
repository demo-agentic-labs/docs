### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This is a Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR MedicinalProductContraindication resource. It specifically defines the 'subject' field of this resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the MedicinalProductContraindication resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the subject of the contraindication |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a FHIR MedicinalProductContraindication resource with the following structure:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "MedicinalProductContraindication",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a fixed structure for the MedicinalProductContraindication resource.
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to insert the unique identifier for the resource.
3. The 'subject' field is an array containing a single object with a 'reference' field.
4. The `{{REF}}` placeholder is used to insert the reference to the subject of the contraindication.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the required placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is designed to be a partial representation of a MedicinalProductContraindication resource, focusing only on the 'id' and 'subject' fields. It may be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete resource representation.
3. The 'subject' field is represented as an array, allowing for potential expansion to multiple subjects, although only one is defined in this template.
