## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for the "subject" field of a QuestionnaireResponse resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### QuestionnaireResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource, focusing on the "subject" field. It sets up the basic structure of the resource and includes placeholders for the resource ID and subject reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the QuestionnaireResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the QuestionnaireResponse |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial QuestionnaireResponse resource with the following structure:
- A "resource" object containing:
  - "resourceType" set to "QuestionnaireResponse"
  - "id" field with the provided ID
  - "subject" object with a "reference" field

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the provided `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate fields of the JSON structure.
2. The "resourceType" is hardcoded as "QuestionnaireResponse".
3. The "subject" field is structured as an object with a single "reference" property, which is populated with the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system that utilizes this template for CDA to FHIR conversion |
