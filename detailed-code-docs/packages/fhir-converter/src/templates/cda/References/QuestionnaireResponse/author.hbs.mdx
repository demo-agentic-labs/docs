### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource, focusing on the `author` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the QuestionnaireResponse resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the author of the QuestionnaireResponse |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a part of a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource, specifically the `author` field.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "QuestionnaireResponse".
3. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. It creates an `author` object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The broader system this template is a part of |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the `author` field of a QuestionnaireResponse, suggesting it's part of a modular system for constructing FHIR resources.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource.
