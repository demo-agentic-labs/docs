### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource, specifically the `partOf` field. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the QuestionnaireResponse resource |
| REF | string | The reference to another resource that this QuestionnaireResponse is part of |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A partial FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource JSON structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "QuestionnaireResponse".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the resource.
4. It defines a `partOf` array with a single element containing a `reference` field.
5. The `reference` field is populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Converter | The larger system this template is a part of, for converting CDA to FHIR |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the values passed to the `ID` and `REF` placeholders when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically for the `partOf` field of a QuestionnaireResponse, suggesting it's meant to be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and is likely meant to be merged with other parts of the QuestionnaireResponse resource.
4. The template follows FHIR resource structure guidelines, using correct field names and data types as per FHIR specifications for QuestionnaireResponse.
