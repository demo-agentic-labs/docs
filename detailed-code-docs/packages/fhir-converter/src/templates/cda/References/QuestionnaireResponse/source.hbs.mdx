### QuestionnaireResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON object representing a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a source reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the QuestionnaireResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference value for the source of the QuestionnaireResponse |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON Object | Object | A JSON representation of a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "QuestionnaireResponse"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `source` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable substitution.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is specifically designed for the "source" attribute of a QuestionnaireResponse, suggesting it might be part of a larger system for generating FHIR resources.
3. The JSON structure is not complete (it has trailing commas and is wrapped in extra braces), indicating it might be a part of a larger JSON structure or require post-processing.
