### QuestionnaireResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource with an embedded encounter reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the QuestionnaireResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the QuestionnaireResponse details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "QuestionnaireResponse"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `encounter`: An object containing a reference to the associated encounter

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "QuestionnaireResponse".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
3. It creates an `encounter` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for the encounter reference.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically located in the CDA to FHIR conversion templates, under the References/QuestionnaireResponse directory.
3. The output JSON structure is nested within a `resource` object, which suggests this template might be used as part of a larger FHIR Bundle or transaction resource.
