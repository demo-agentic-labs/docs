## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource with a `basedOn` property. It's designed to create a JSON structure representing a QuestionnaireResponse that is based on another resource.

### QuestionnaireResponse Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a `basedOn` array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the QuestionnaireResponse resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the resource this QuestionnaireResponse is based on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "QuestionnaireResponse"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `basedOn` array with a single object containing a `reference` field set to the provided `REF`

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The structure of the QuestionnaireResponse is fixed, with placeholders for the ID and reference.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project (likely the FHIR Converter) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template creates a nested structure with `resource` as the top-level key, which might be part of a larger FHIR Bundle or a specific formatting requirement of the system using this template.
3. The `basedOn` array is hardcoded to contain only one element. If multiple references are needed, the template would need to be modified.
4. The comma after the closing brace of the `reference` object and the closing bracket of the `basedOn` array might cause issues in strict JSON parsing. These should be removed for valid JSON.
