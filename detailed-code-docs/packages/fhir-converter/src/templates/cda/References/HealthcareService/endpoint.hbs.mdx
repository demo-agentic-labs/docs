### HealthcareService Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR HealthcareService resource. It includes an ID and an endpoint reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the HealthcareService resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the endpoint associated with this healthcare service |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR HealthcareService resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "HealthcareService"
3. Assigns the provided ID to the "id" field
4. Creates an "endpoint" array with a single object containing a "reference" property
5. Sets the "reference" value to the provided REF input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It uses a fixed structure for the HealthcareService resource.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
2. The template is designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely used to transform data from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to FHIR.
3. The structure of the output JSON is compliant with the FHIR standard for HealthcareService resources, focusing specifically on the endpoint reference.
4. The template allows for only one endpoint reference. If multiple endpoints are needed, the template would need to be modified to accept and process multiple references.
