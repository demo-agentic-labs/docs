### HealthcareService Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR HealthcareService resource with a specific structure, including an id and a coverageArea array with a single reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The identifier for the HealthcareService resource |
| REF | String | The reference for the coverageArea |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR HealthcareService resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "HealthcareService"
  - `id`: The provided ID
  - `coverageArea`: An array with a single object containing:
    - `reference`: The provided REF value

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure. The `coverageArea` is defined as an array with a single object, allowing for potential expansion to multiple coverage areas if needed.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR converters for transforming data between different healthcare data formats.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The structure is fixed, with only the `ID` and `REF` values being variable.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.
