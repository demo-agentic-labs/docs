## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template that defines the structure for a FHIR HealthcareService resource with a location reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### HealthcareService Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR HealthcareService resource with a location reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to allow for dynamic insertion of values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the HealthcareService resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the associated Location resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR HealthcareService resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: The main container for the resource
  - `resourceType`: Set to "HealthcareService"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this HealthcareService
  - `location`: An array containing a single object with a reference to the associated Location

#### Internal Logic
The template uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to allow for dynamic insertion of the resource ID and location reference. These values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Dependencies
This template is designed to be used with a Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in web applications and, in this case, for FHIR data transformation.

## Configuration
The template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The structure is fixed, with only the `id` and location `reference` being customizable through the Handlebars placeholders.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would typically be managed by the system rendering the template.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this template defines a structure that conforms to the FHIR HealthcareService resource specification. The key elements are:

| Element | Type | Description |
|:--------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | string | Always set to "HealthcareService" |
| id | string | Unique identifier for this HealthcareService resource |
| location | array | Contains a single object with a reference to the associated Location resource |

Note: This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It specifically handles the creation of a HealthcareService resource with a location reference, which is a common element in healthcare data representations.
