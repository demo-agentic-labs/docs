## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR HealthcareService resources. These templates are part of a FHIR converter, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the HealthcareService resource, such as coverageArea, endpoint, location, and providedBy references.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create structured JSON representations of FHIR HealthcareService resources. They allow for the dynamic insertion of specific data (like IDs and references) into predefined FHIR-compliant structures. This process is crucial in healthcare data interoperability, enabling the conversion of data from one format (CDA) to another (FHIR) while maintaining the semantic meaning and relationships between different healthcare entities.

## Key Files
1. coverageArea.hbs: Generates a HealthcareService resource with a coverageArea reference, indicating the geographical area where the service is provided.
2. endpoint.hbs: Creates a HealthcareService resource with an endpoint reference, specifying the technical details of how to access the service.
3. location.hbs: Produces a HealthcareService resource with a location reference, linking the service to a physical or virtual location.
4. providedBy.hbs: Constructs a HealthcareService resource with a providedBy reference, indicating the organization or entity responsible for providing the service.

Each of these templates follows a similar structure:

```handlebars
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "HealthcareService",
    "id": "{{ID}}",
    "specificElement": [
      {
        "reference": "{{REF}}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Where `specificElement` is replaced by coverageArea, endpoint, location, or providedBy, depending on the template.

## Dependencies
These templates are designed to work with the Handlebars templating engine, which is commonly used in FHIR converters for transforming data between different healthcare data formats. The templates themselves don't specify a version, but they would typically be used with a Handlebars version compatible with the overall FHIR converter system.

## Configuration
While the templates don't have explicit configuration options, they all use two primary variables:

1. `{{ID}}`: The unique identifier for the HealthcareService resource.
2. `{{REF}}`: The reference to the specific element (coverageArea, endpoint, location, or provider) associated with the HealthcareService.

These variables are expected to be provided when the templates are rendered, allowing for dynamic generation of FHIR resources based on the input data.

It's worth noting that these templates are part of a larger FHIR conversion system. The system would be responsible for providing the correct values for these variables, likely extracted from the source CDA documents or other data sources.

The fixed structure of these templates ensures that the generated JSON objects comply with the FHIR standard for HealthcareService resources. This standardization is crucial for maintaining interoperability in healthcare data exchange.
