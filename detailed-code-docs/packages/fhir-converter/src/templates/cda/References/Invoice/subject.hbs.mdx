## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for the "subject" field of an Invoice resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It's designed to be used in a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR conversion process, specifically for creating the subject reference within an Invoice resource.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for an Invoice resource with a focus on the "subject" field. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Invoice resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the subject of the Invoice |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing part of an Invoice resource with the subject field populated |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Within the "resource" object, it sets:
   - "resourceType" as "Invoice"
   - "id" using the provided `{{ID}}` value
   - "subject" as an object with a "reference" property, populated by the `{{REF}}` value

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. The behavior is determined by the values passed for `{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}` when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the system that uses this template.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API itself, but it contributes to the creation of a FHIR Invoice resource. The relevant part of the FHIR Invoice resource structure it helps create is:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| resourceType | String | Always set to "Invoice" |
| id | String | Unique identifier for the Invoice resource |
| subject | Object | Contains a reference to the subject of the Invoice |

Note: The template only defines a partial structure of the Invoice resource, focusing on the "subject" field.
