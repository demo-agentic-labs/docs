## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Invoice resource structure, specifically focusing on the `lineItem` array with a `chargeItemReference` object. It's designed to be used in the context of converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format.

### Template
#### Description
This Handlebars template creates a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Invoice resource. It specifically defines the `lineItem` array with a single item containing a `chargeItemReference` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The identifier for the Invoice resource |
| REF  | string | The reference value for the chargeItemReference |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Invoice resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Invoice".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the Invoice's id.
4. It defines a `lineItem` array with a single item.
5. Within the line item, it creates a `chargeItemReference` object with a `reference` field.
6. The `reference` field uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format. It likely depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be used within a larger templating system, where the `ID` and `REF` values would be provided dynamically.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is rendered.

## Logging
This template doesn't implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
While this template doesn't define an API itself, it contributes to creating a FHIR-compliant JSON structure. The resulting JSON would be part of the FHIR Invoice resource, adhering to the FHIR specification for the Invoice resource type.
