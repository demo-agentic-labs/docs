#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object representing a FHIR Invoice resource.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "Invoice".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. Creates an `account` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Side Effects
This template has no side effects as it only generates a JSON structure based on the provided inputs.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required inputs (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is used.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is designed to be used as part of a larger FHIR resource generation system. It expects to receive `ID` and `REF` values when invoked.

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the Invoice resource |
| REF | string | Reference to the associated account |

The output is a JSON object representing a partial FHIR Invoice resource with an account reference.
