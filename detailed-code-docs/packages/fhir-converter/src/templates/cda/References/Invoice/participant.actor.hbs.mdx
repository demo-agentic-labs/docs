## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial structure for an FHIR Invoice resource, specifically focusing on the participant actor reference. It's designed to be used as part of a larger template for creating FHIR Invoice resources from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an FHIR Invoice resource with a participant actor reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into the JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the Invoice resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the actor participating in the invoice |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Invoice resource with a participant actor reference.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template starts with a copyright and license notice in a Handlebars comment block.
2. It then defines a JSON structure for an FHIR Invoice resource.
3. The `id` field is populated with the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. The `participant` array contains a single object with an `actor` property.
5. The `actor` property has a `reference` field populated with the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any explicit configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`), which allow for dynamic content insertion when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. This template represents only a partial Invoice resource structure, focusing specifically on the participant actor reference.
2. The template uses FHIR R4 resource structure for Invoice.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and would likely be combined with other partial templates to form a complete Invoice resource.
4. The template follows the FHIR specification for Invoice resources, particularly the participant and actor elements.
5. This file is part of a larger FHIR converter project, likely used in healthcare data interoperability scenarios.
