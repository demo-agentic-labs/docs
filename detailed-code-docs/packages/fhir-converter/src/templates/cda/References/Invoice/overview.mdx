## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating various parts of FHIR Invoice resources. These templates are designed to be used in a system that converts Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of the Invoice resource, such as the account, issuer, line items, participants, recipient, and subject.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create different components of a FHIR Invoice resource. When processed by a Handlebars engine, they generate JSON structures that represent parts of an Invoice. These parts can then be combined to form a complete FHIR Invoice resource. The templates allow for dynamic insertion of data, making them flexible for use with different input data.

For example, one template might create the structure for the invoice issuer, while another creates the structure for the invoice recipient. By using these templates, the conversion system can build up a complete Invoice resource piece by piece, inserting the appropriate data from the CDA source into each section.

## Key Files
1. `account.hbs`: Creates the account reference for an Invoice resource.
2. `issuer.hbs`: Generates the issuer field for an Invoice resource.
3. `lineItem.chargeItemReference.hbs`: Produces the line item structure with a charge item reference.
4. `participant.actor.hbs`: Constructs the participant actor reference for an Invoice.
5. `recipient.hbs`: Builds the recipient field for an Invoice resource.
6. `subject.hbs`: Forms the subject reference for an Invoice resource.

Each of these templates focuses on a specific part of the Invoice resource, allowing for modular construction of the complete resource.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders and generate the final JSON structures. They are designed to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, likely depending on other components to provide the necessary input data and to combine the outputs into complete FHIR resources.

The templates adhere to the FHIR specification, particularly the structure defined for Invoice resources in FHIR R4.

## Configuration
While the templates themselves don't include explicit configuration options, they are designed to be flexible through the use of Handlebars placeholders. The main configurable elements are:

1. `{{ID}}`: Used to set the unique identifier for the Invoice resource.
2. `{{REF}}`: Used to set references to other resources or entities, such as the account, issuer, or subject.

These placeholders allow the templates to be used with different input data, adapting to the specific needs of each conversion scenario.

Here's an example of how the `subject.hbs` template uses these placeholders:

```handlebars
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Invoice",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "subject": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `{{ID}}` would be replaced with the actual Invoice ID, and `{{REF}}` would be replaced with the reference to the subject of the Invoice.

The system using these templates would need to ensure that the appropriate values are provided for these placeholders when rendering the templates.
