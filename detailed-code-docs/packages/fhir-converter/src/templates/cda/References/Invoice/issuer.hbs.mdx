## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Invoice resource structure, specifically focusing on the `issuer` field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for a FHIR Invoice resource with an `issuer` field. The template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the `id` and `issuer.reference` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Invoice resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the issuer of the invoice |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A partial FHIR Invoice resource structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Invoice".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` field of the Invoice resource.
4. It creates an `issuer` object with a `reference` field, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder for its value.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It may depend on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON structure |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and content of the Invoice resource |

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template only defines a partial structure of an Invoice resource. In a complete FHIR Invoice, there would typically be additional fields and possibly nested resources.
3. The use of Handlebars suggests that this template is meant to be processed by a Handlebars engine, likely as part of a larger data transformation pipeline.
4. The structure adheres to the FHIR resource format, which uses JSON for data representation.
