## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR Invoice resource structure, specifically focusing on the recipient field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### Invoice Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial structure for a FHIR Invoice resource, specifically defining the `recipient` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Invoice resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the recipient of the invoice |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing a partial FHIR Invoice resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "Invoice".
3. It uses the `{{ID}}` input to set the `id` field of the Invoice resource.
4. It creates a `recipient` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `{{REF}}` input.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources. It depends on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` variables will be provided and valid when the template is rendered.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template is not an API itself, but it generates a partial FHIR Invoice resource that conforms to the FHIR specification. The structure it creates is:

```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Invoice",
        "id": "[ID value]",
        "recipient": {
            "reference": "[REF value]"
        }
    }
}
```

This structure can be used as part of a larger FHIR Invoice resource or message.
