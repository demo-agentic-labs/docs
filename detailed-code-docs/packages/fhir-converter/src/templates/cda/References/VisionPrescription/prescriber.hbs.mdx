## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR VisionPrescription resource structure, specifically focusing on the prescriber field. It's designed to be used in the context of converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.

### VisionPrescription Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for a FHIR VisionPrescription resource, with emphasis on the prescriber field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the VisionPrescription resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the prescriber resource |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a partial FHIR VisionPrescription resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "VisionPrescription"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `prescriber`: An object containing:
    - `reference`: A reference to the prescriber resource

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "VisionPrescription"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `prescriber` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
This template doesn't define any specific configuration options. It uses Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation (e.g., `{{ID}}`, `{{REF}}`).

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and likely meant to be combined with other partial templates to form a complete FHIR VisionPrescription resource.
4. The template focuses solely on the prescriber information and doesn't include other fields that might be part of a complete VisionPrescription resource.
