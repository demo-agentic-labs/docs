## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for creating partial FHIR VisionPrescription resources. These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system, specifically designed for converting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. The templates focus on different aspects of a VisionPrescription resource, including encounter, patient, and prescriber references.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to generate JSON structures that represent parts of a FHIR VisionPrescription resource. They allow for the dynamic insertion of specific data (such as IDs and references) into predefined FHIR-compliant structures. This process is crucial in the conversion of CDA documents to FHIR format, enabling interoperability between different healthcare systems.

Each template creates a partial JSON structure for a VisionPrescription resource, focusing on a specific aspect:
1. The encounter template links the prescription to a specific healthcare encounter.
2. The patient template associates the prescription with a particular patient.
3. The prescriber template identifies the healthcare provider who issued the prescription.

When combined, these partial structures can form a complete VisionPrescription resource that adheres to the FHIR specification.

## Key Files
1. `encounter.hbs`: This template creates a VisionPrescription resource structure with an embedded encounter reference. It allows linking the prescription to a specific healthcare encounter.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "VisionPrescription",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "encounter": {
         "reference": "{{REF}}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. `patient.hbs`: This template generates a VisionPrescription resource structure with a patient reference. It associates the prescription with a specific patient.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "VisionPrescription",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "patient": {
         "reference": "{{REF}}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. `prescriber.hbs`: This template creates a VisionPrescription resource structure focusing on the prescriber field. It identifies the healthcare provider who issued the prescription.

   Example output:
   ```json
   {
     "resource": {
       "resourceType": "VisionPrescription",
       "id": "{{ID}}",
       "prescriber": {
         "reference": "{{REF}}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Each of these templates uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the respective references (encounter, patient, or prescriber).

## Dependencies
These templates are part of a larger FHIR converter system and primarily depend on:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for dynamic content insertion | Not specified |

The Handlebars templating engine is crucial for processing these templates and allowing for the dynamic insertion of data into the predefined JSON structures.

## Configuration
These templates don't include specific configuration options. They expect values for `ID` and `REF` to be provided when the templates are rendered. These values would typically be supplied by the larger FHIR converter system based on the CDA data being processed.

The templates are designed to be flexible and can be used in various contexts within the FHIR conversion process. The actual configuration and use of these templates would be determined by the broader FHIR converter system they are part of.

It's important to note that these templates create partial structures of a VisionPrescription resource. In a real-world scenario, additional fields and more complex structures would typically be required to create a complete and valid FHIR VisionPrescription resource. The templates in this directory focus on specific aspects (encounter, patient, and prescriber) and would need to be combined with other data and possibly other templates to form a complete resource.
