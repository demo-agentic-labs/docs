### VisionPrescription Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR VisionPrescription resource with an embedded encounter reference. The template uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the encounter reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the VisionPrescription resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the associated encounter |

#### Outputs
A JSON object representing a FHIR VisionPrescription resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "VisionPrescription",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "encounter": {
            "reference": "{{REF}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template defines a JSON structure for a FHIR VisionPrescription resource.
2. It uses Handlebars placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`) to dynamically insert values for the resource's ID and the encounter reference.
3. The `resourceType` is set to "VisionPrescription" to conform to FHIR specifications.
4. The `encounter` field is populated with a reference object, linking this VisionPrescription to a specific encounter.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR converter system and depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for dynamic content insertion |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The values for `ID` and `REF` are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.
