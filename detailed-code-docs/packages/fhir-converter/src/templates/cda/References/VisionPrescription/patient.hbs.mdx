## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a FHIR VisionPrescription resource with a patient reference. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### VisionPrescription Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR VisionPrescription resource with a patient reference. It's a partial template that likely fits into a larger FHIR document structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | String | The unique identifier for the VisionPrescription resource |
| REF  | String | The reference to the patient associated with this vision prescription |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a FHIR VisionPrescription resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the VisionPrescription details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "VisionPrescription"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for this resource
  - `patient`: An object containing a reference to the associated patient

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure.
2. The `resourceType` is hardcoded as "VisionPrescription".
3. The `patient` object is created with a `reference` property, which is set to the value of `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a FHIR converter system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON output |
| FHIR Specification | Defines the structure and content of the VisionPrescription resource |

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template is specifically designed for the CDA to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure (`packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/VisionPrescription/`).
3. The output JSON structure is not complete and likely needs to be combined with other templates or data to form a complete FHIR resource.
4. The template follows the FHIR resource structure for VisionPrescription, but only includes the `id` and `patient` fields. In a real-world scenario, additional fields would typically be required for a complete VisionPrescription resource.
