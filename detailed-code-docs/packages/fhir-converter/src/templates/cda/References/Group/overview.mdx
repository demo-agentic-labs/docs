## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars templates for generating FHIR Group resources with various properties and references. These templates are part of a FHIR converter, likely used for transforming Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data to FHIR format. The templates focus on different aspects of a Group resource, including characteristics, managing entities, and member entities.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create JSON structures representing different parts of a FHIR Group resource. They allow for the dynamic generation of Group resources with specific properties:

1. A Group with a characteristic that references another resource
2. A Group with a managing entity reference
3. A Group with a single member entity reference

Each template takes input parameters (typically an ID and a reference) and uses them to populate a standardized JSON structure. This approach enables the creation of flexible and reusable components for building FHIR-compliant Group resources.

## Key Files
1. `characteristic.valueReference.hbs`: Generates a Group resource with a characteristic that includes a valueReference to another resource.
2. `managingEntity.hbs`: Creates a Group resource with a reference to a managing entity.
3. `member.entity.hbs`: Produces a Group resource with a single member entity reference.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, using Handlebars syntax to insert dynamic values into a predefined JSON structure. They all contribute to different aspects of a FHIR Group resource, allowing for modular composition of complex Group representations.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output. No specific versions are mentioned in the provided summaries.

The choice of Handlebars as the templating engine likely stems from its simplicity, flexibility, and widespread use in JavaScript environments. It allows for easy insertion of dynamic values into predefined structures, which is ideal for generating standardized FHIR resources with varying content.

## Configuration
No specific configuration files or environment variables are mentioned for these templates. The templates expect input parameters (typically `ID` and `REF`) to be provided at runtime when rendering the template.

The configurable fields in these templates are:

1. `ID`: A unique identifier for the Group resource
2. `REF`: A reference to another resource (e.g., a characteristic value, managing entity, or member entity)

These fields allow for the creation of diverse Group resources while maintaining a consistent structure.

It's worth noting that all templates include a comprehensive copyright and license notice, indicating that they are part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation. The license appears to be a combination of AGPL v3 and a permissive license similar to the MIT license. This licensing information should be carefully reviewed and maintained as the project evolves.
