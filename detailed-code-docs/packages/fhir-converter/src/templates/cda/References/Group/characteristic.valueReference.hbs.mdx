### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Group resource. It includes a characteristic with a valueReference, which is used to reference another resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the Group resource |
| REF | String | The reference to another resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing a FHIR Group resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Sets the "resourceType" to "Group".
3. Assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. Creates a "characteristic" array with one element.
5. Within the characteristic, sets a "valueReference" object with a "reference" property using the provided `REF` value.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders ({{ID}} and {{REF}}).

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The generated JSON structure follows the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for representing a Group resource.
3. The template is designed to be flexible, allowing different IDs and references to be passed in when rendering.
