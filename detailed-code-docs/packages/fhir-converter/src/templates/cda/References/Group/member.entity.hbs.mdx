### Handlebars Template
#### Description
This template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR Group resource. It includes a single member with an entity reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID   | string | The unique identifier for the Group resource |
| REF  | string | The reference to the entity that is a member of the Group |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR Group resource with the following structure:
- A `resource` object containing:
  - `resourceType`: Set to "Group"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the Group
  - `member`: An array with a single object representing the group member
    - `entity`: An object with a `reference` field containing the entity reference

#### Internal Logic
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax to insert the `ID` and `REF` values into the appropriate places in the JSON structure.
2. The `resourceType` is hardcoded as "Group".
3. The `member` array contains a single object with an `entity` property, which includes the `reference` to the member entity.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process and render the final output.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options defined in this template. The `ID` and `REF` values are expected to be provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
This template does not include any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided and valid when the template is used.

## TODOs
The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, which covers both the original Microsoft Corporation copyright and the subsequent Metriport Inc. copyright. This notice should be reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure it remains current and accurate.
