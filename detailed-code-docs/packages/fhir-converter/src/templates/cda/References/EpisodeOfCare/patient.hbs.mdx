### EpisodeOfCare Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a JSON structure for an EpisodeOfCare FHIR resource. It includes the resource type, an ID, and a patient reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EpisodeOfCare resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the patient associated with this episode of care |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing an EpisodeOfCare FHIR resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `resourceType` to "EpisodeOfCare"
2. Assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field
3. Creates a `patient` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine for processing.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this template.

## Error Handling
This template does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` values will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project (Metriport Inc.) and incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (\{\{...\}\}) for dynamic content insertion.
3. The structure of the output JSON is designed to be compliant with the FHIR standard for EpisodeOfCare resources.
4. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format, specifically handling the patient reference within an EpisodeOfCare resource.
