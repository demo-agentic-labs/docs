## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines the structure for the `managingOrganization` field within an `EpisodeOfCare` resource in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, specifically for converting CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

## Symbols

### Unnamed Template
#### Description
This is an unnamed Handlebars template that generates a JSON structure for an `EpisodeOfCare` resource with a `managingOrganization` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The identifier for the EpisodeOfCare resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the managing organization |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON structure representing part of an `EpisodeOfCare` resource in FHIR format.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a `resource` property.
2. Inside `resource`, it sets the `resourceType` to "EpisodeOfCare".
3. It sets the `id` of the resource using the `{{ID}}` placeholder.
4. It creates a `managingOrganization` object with a `reference` property, using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is part of a larger FHIR conversion system and likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. However, it's designed to be used within a larger FHIR conversion system, which may have its own configuration settings.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the surrounding FHIR conversion system.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in this template.

## API/Interface Reference
This template doesn't define an API itself, but it's part of a larger system for converting CDA to FHIR format. The output of this template would be used as part of that conversion process.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving both Metriport Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.
2. The use of double curly braces (e.g., `{{ID}}`) indicates Handlebars syntax for variable interpolation.
3. The JSON structure is not complete and seems to be a part of a larger FHIR resource structure.
4. The indentation and comma placement suggest that this snippet might be part of a larger template or JSON structure.
