## High-level description
This Handlebars template defines a partial FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) EpisodeOfCare resource structure, specifically focusing on the "team" attribute. It's designed to be used in a FHIR converter, likely for transforming CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format.

### EpisodeOfCare Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial JSON structure for an EpisodeOfCare resource in FHIR format. It specifically defines the "team" attribute of the EpisodeOfCare resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EpisodeOfCare resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the team associated with this episode of care |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a partial EpisodeOfCare resource with the following structure:
```json
{
    "resource": {
        "resourceType": "EpisodeOfCare",
        "id": "{{ID}}",
        "team": [
            {
                "reference": "{{REF}}"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "EpisodeOfCare".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder for the resource's `id`.
3. The `team` attribute is an array containing a single object with a `reference` field.
4. The `reference` field uses the `{{REF}}` placeholder to specify the team reference.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and may depend on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template doesn't define any specific configuration options. However, it's designed to be flexible through the use of placeholders (`{{ID}}` and `{{REF}}`), which would be populated during the conversion process.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this template. Error handling would likely be managed by the surrounding conversion system.

## Notes
1. This template appears to be part of a larger FHIR conversion system, specifically for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The structure allows for only one team reference. If multiple team references are needed, the template would need to be modified to accommodate an array of references.
4. This is a partial resource definition, focusing only on the "team" attribute of an EpisodeOfCare resource. Other attributes of the EpisodeOfCare resource are not included in this template.
