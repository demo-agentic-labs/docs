### EpisodeOfCare Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a partial FHIR EpisodeOfCare resource with a focus on the careManager field. It's structured to be included as part of a larger FHIR bundle or resource set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EpisodeOfCare resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the care manager, typically a Practitioner or PractitionerRole resource |

#### Outputs
The template outputs a JSON object representing a partial FHIR EpisodeOfCare resource.

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a nested JSON structure.
2. It sets the `resourceType` to "EpisodeOfCare".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the `id` field.
4. It creates a `careManager` object with a `reference` field, populated by the `REF` input.

## Dependencies
This template is part of the FHIR Converter project and is designed to work within the Handlebars templating system.

## Configuration
This template doesn't include any specific configuration options. It relies on the inputs provided when the template is rendered.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the `ID` and `REF` inputs will be provided correctly when the template is used.

## Notes
1. This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
2. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but is now maintained by Metriport Inc. under the AGPLv3 license.
3. The structure suggests this template might be used in conjunction with other templates to build a complete FHIR resource or bundle.
4. The careManager reference is a key component in the EpisodeOfCare resource, typically linking to the healthcare provider managing the episode of care.
