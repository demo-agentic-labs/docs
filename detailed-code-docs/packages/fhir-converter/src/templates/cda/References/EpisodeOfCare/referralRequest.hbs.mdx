## High-level description
This file contains a Handlebars template that generates a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) EpisodeOfCare resource with a referral request. The template is specifically designed to create a JSON structure representing an EpisodeOfCare with a reference to a referral request.

### EpisodeOfCare Template
#### Description
This template defines the structure of an EpisodeOfCare resource in FHIR format. It includes a referral request reference within the resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | The unique identifier for the EpisodeOfCare resource |
| REF | String | The reference to the referral request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A JSON object representing the EpisodeOfCare resource with a referral request |

#### Internal Logic
1. The template creates a JSON object with a "resource" property.
2. Inside the "resource" object, it sets the "resourceType" to "EpisodeOfCare".
3. It assigns the provided `ID` to the "id" field.
4. It creates a "referralRequest" array with a single object containing a "reference" property set to the provided `REF`.

## Dependencies
This template relies on the Handlebars templating engine to process the placeholders (\{\{ID\}\} and \{\{REF\}\}) and generate the final JSON structure.

## Configuration
This template does not include any specific configuration options. The structure of the EpisodeOfCare resource is fixed, with placeholders for the ID and referral request reference.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that the required input values (ID and REF) will be provided when the template is rendered.

## Logging
This template does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it does represent a structure that could be used in an API response. The generated JSON object conforms to the FHIR EpisodeOfCare resource structure, specifically including a referral request reference.

## Notes
1. The file includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it is part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The template uses the Handlebars syntax (\{\{...\}\}) for variable substitution.
3. The structure adheres to the FHIR standard for representing healthcare data, specifically an EpisodeOfCare resource with a referral request.
4. This template appears to be part of a larger system for converting or generating FHIR resources, possibly from CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data, as suggested by the file path.
