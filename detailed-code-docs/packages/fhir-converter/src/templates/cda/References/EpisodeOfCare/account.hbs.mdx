### EpisodeOfCare Resource Template
#### Description
This template creates a FHIR EpisodeOfCare resource with an account reference. It uses Handlebars syntax to dynamically insert values for the resource ID and account reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | The unique identifier for the EpisodeOfCare resource |
| REF | string | The reference to the associated account |

#### Outputs
The output is a JSON object representing a FHIR EpisodeOfCare resource with the following structure:
- `resource`: An object containing the EpisodeOfCare resource details
  - `resourceType`: Set to "EpisodeOfCare"
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the resource
  - `account`: An array containing a single object with a `reference` property

#### Internal Logic
1. The template sets the `resourceType` to "EpisodeOfCare".
2. It uses the `{{ID}}` placeholder to set the `id` of the resource.
3. It creates an `account` array with a single object containing a `reference` property.
4. The `reference` property is set using the `{{REF}}` placeholder.

## Dependencies
This template is likely part of a larger FHIR conversion system and depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine for generating the JSON output |

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options in this template. The behavior is determined by the input values provided for `ID` and `REF`.

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the required input values (`ID` and `REF`) will be provided by the calling context.

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the top, indicating that it's part of a larger project involving Metriport Inc. and incorporating work from Microsoft Corporation.
2. The license is AGPLv3 for the Metriport Inc. portion, while the Microsoft portion is provided under a more permissive license.
3. The template is specifically designed for the CDA to FHIR conversion process, as indicated by its location in the file structure (`packages/fhir-converter/src/templates/cda/References/EpisodeOfCare/`).
4. The JSON structure includes some trailing commas, which might need to be removed depending on the JSON parser used in the conversion process.
