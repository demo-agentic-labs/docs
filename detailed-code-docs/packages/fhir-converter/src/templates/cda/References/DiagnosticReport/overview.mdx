## High-level description
This directory contains Handlebars template files for creating FHIR DiagnosticReport resources from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) data. Each template focuses on a specific aspect or reference within the DiagnosticReport resource, such as assessment, basedOn, encounter, imagingStudy, media link, performer, result, resultsInterpreter, specimen, and subject.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to convert CDA diagnostic report data into FHIR-compliant DiagnosticReport resources. They handle various aspects of a diagnostic report, including:

1. Basic report information (assessment.hbs)
2. The order or request that led to the report (basedOn.hbs)
3. The associated healthcare encounter (encounter.hbs)
4. Related imaging studies (imagingStudy.hbs)
5. Media links associated with the report (media.link.hbs)
6. The performer of the diagnostic procedure (performer.hbs)
7. The results of the diagnostic report (result.hbs)
8. The interpreter of the results (resultsInterpreter.hbs)
9. The specimen used for the diagnostic procedure (specimen.hbs)
10. The subject (patient) of the diagnostic report (subject.hbs)

Each template generates a JSON structure that represents a part of or a complete DiagnosticReport resource, following FHIR specifications.

## Key Files
1. assessment.hbs: Creates the main structure of the DiagnosticReport, including code, status, and presented form.
2. basedOn.hbs: Adds a reference to the order or request that initiated the diagnostic report.
3. encounter.hbs: Links the DiagnosticReport to a specific healthcare encounter.
4. imagingStudy.hbs: Associates the DiagnosticReport with related imaging studies.
5. media.link.hbs: Includes references to media associated with the report.
6. performer.hbs: Specifies the performer of the diagnostic procedure.
7. result.hbs: Includes references to the results of the diagnostic report.
8. resultsInterpreter.hbs: Specifies the interpreter of the diagnostic results.
9. specimen.hbs: Links the DiagnosticReport to the specimen used in the diagnostic procedure.
10. subject.hbs: Specifies the subject (patient) of the diagnostic report.

## Dependencies
These templates rely on the following external dependencies:

1. Handlebars: The templating engine used to generate the FHIR resources.
2. FHIR specification: The templates follow the FHIR standard for structuring healthcare data.

Additionally, the templates use several partial templates:

1. DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs: Used to format code fields in FHIR resources.
2. ValueSet/DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs: Used to determine and format the status of the DiagnosticReport.

## Configuration
The templates use some configuration options, primarily:

1. canBeUnknown: A boolean parameter used in the CodeableConcept partial template, allowing codes to be set as "unknown" if not provided.

Each template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating that they are based on work by Microsoft Corporation but have been modified and are now licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.

These templates form a crucial part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources, focusing specifically on the DiagnosticReport resource and its various components and references.
