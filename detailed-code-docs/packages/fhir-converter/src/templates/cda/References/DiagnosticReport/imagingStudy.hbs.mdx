## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource with an imaging study reference. It's designed to convert CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data into FHIR format, specifically for diagnostic reports related to imaging studies.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource. It includes the resource type, id, code, status, and a reference to an imaging study.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the DiagnosticReport |
| diagReport | object | Contains diagnostic report data including code, title, and status |
| REF | string | Reference to the associated imaging study |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A FHIR-compliant DiagnosticReport resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a fullUrl using the provided ID
2. Sets the resourceType to "DiagnosticReport"
3. Includes the code using a partial template (CodeableConcept.hbs)
4. Sets the status using a partial template (DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs)
5. Adds a reference to the imaging study

### Partial Templates
#### Description
The template uses two partial templates:
1. `DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs`: Used to generate the code field
2. `ValueSet/DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs`: Used to generate the status field

These partials are not defined in this file but are referenced, indicating they exist elsewhere in the template structure.

## Dependencies
The template relies on the following Handlebars partial templates:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs | Generates the code field for the DiagnosticReport |
| ValueSet/DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs | Generates the status field for the DiagnosticReport |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft Corporation but is now maintained by Metriport Inc.
2. The template uses Handlebars syntax (\{\{...\}\}) for dynamic content insertion.
3. The `canBeUnknown=true` parameter in the CodeableConcept partial suggests that the code can be unspecified or unknown.
4. The imaging study reference is hardcoded to include only one study, but the structure (using an array) suggests it could potentially support multiple studies.

This template is part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources, specifically focusing on diagnostic reports with imaging studies.
