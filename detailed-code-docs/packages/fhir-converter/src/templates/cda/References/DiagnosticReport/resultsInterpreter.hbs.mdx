## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource with a focus on the `resultsInterpreter` field. It's designed to convert CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format, specifically for diagnostic report information.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template creates a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource structure with specific fields populated from the input data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Unique identifier for the DiagnosticReport resource |
| diagReport | Object | Contains diagnostic report data from the CDA document |
| REF | String | Reference to the results interpreter |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A FHIR-compliant DiagnosticReport resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `fullUrl` using the provided `ID`.
2. Sets the `resourceType` to "DiagnosticReport".
3. Populates the `id` field with the provided `ID`.
4. Uses a partial template to set the `code` field based on `diagReport.code` and `diagReport.title._`.
5. Uses a partial template to set the `status` field based on `diagReport.statusCode.code`.
6. Sets the `resultsInterpreter` field with a reference to the interpreter.

## Dependencies
The template relies on several partial templates:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs | Used to format the `code` field |
| ValueSet/DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs | Used to format the `status` field |

## Configuration
The template uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| canBeUnknown | Boolean | true | Used in the CodeableConcept partial to indicate if the code can be unknown |

## Notes
1. The template includes a comprehensive copyright notice at the beginning, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but modified and licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.
2. The template is designed to be part of a larger system for converting CDA documents to FHIR resources.
3. The `resultsInterpreter` field is set up as an array with a single element, suggesting it could potentially support multiple interpreters in future iterations.
4. The use of partial templates (indicated by `{{&gt;...}}`) suggests a modular approach to template design, promoting reusability and maintainability.
