## High-level description
This Handlebars template file defines the structure for creating a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource with a media link. It's specifically designed to convert CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data to FHIR format, focusing on the media aspect of a diagnostic report.

### Main Template
#### Description
The main template generates a JSON structure for a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource with a media link. It includes the resource's fullUrl, id, code, status, and a media array with a single link reference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | String | Unique identifier for the DiagnosticReport resource |
| diagReport | Object | Contains diagnostic report data including code, title, and statusCode |
| REF | String | Reference to the linked media resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | Object | A FHIR-compliant DiagnosticReport resource with media link |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the fullUrl and id using the provided ID.
2. Uses partial templates to populate the code and status fields.
3. Creates a media array with a single item containing a link reference.

### Partial Templates
#### Description
The template uses two partial templates:
1. `DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs`: Used to generate the code field.
2. `ValueSet/DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs`: Used to generate the status field.

These partials are likely defined in separate files and are responsible for formatting specific data types according to FHIR specifications.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template engine used for generating the JSON structure |

## Configuration
The template includes a configuration section at the top, which is a comment block containing copyright and license information. This indicates that the file is part of a larger project with specific licensing terms.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this template. It assumes that all required data is provided and correctly formatted.

## Performance Considerations
As a template, the performance of this code depends on the Handlebars rendering engine and the size of the input data. For large datasets, multiple iterations of the template could potentially impact performance.
