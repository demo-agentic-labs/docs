### DiagnosticReport Template
#### Description
This template creates a DiagnosticReport resource with a focus on the specimen reference. It includes basic information such as the resource type, ID, code, status, and a reference to a specimen.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ID | string | Unique identifier for the DiagnosticReport |
| diagReport.code | object | Code representing the type of diagnostic report |
| diagReport.title._ | string | Title of the diagnostic report |
| diagReport.statusCode.code | string | Status code of the diagnostic report |
| REF | string | Reference to the specimen |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON | object | A JSON object representing a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FHIR DiagnosticReport resource with a unique identifier.
2. Sets the `code` using the `CodeableConcept` partial template.
3. Sets the `status` using the `DiagnosticReportStatus` partial template.
4. Includes a `specimen` array with a single reference to the specimen.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs | Used to format the `code` field |
| ValueSet/DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs | Used to format the `status` field |

## Notes
1. The template uses Handlebars syntax, indicated by the use of double curly braces `{{}}`.
2. It includes partial templates (indicated by `&gt;`) for formatting specific fields:
   - `DataType/CodeableConcept.hbs` for the `code` field
   - `ValueSet/DiagnosticReportStatus.hbs` for the `status` field
3. The `canBeUnknown=true` parameter in the CodeableConcept partial suggests that the code can have an "unknown" value.
4. The template is part of a larger system, likely used for converting CDA documents to FHIR format.
5. The file includes a detailed copyright notice, indicating it's based on work by Microsoft but modified and licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.

This template provides a structured way to create a DiagnosticReport resource in FHIR format, with a focus on including a specimen reference. It's designed to be flexible and reusable within a larger FHIR conversion system.
