## High-level description
This code defines a utility function for worker thread task processing in a Node.js environment. It sets up a message listener on the parent port and handles the processing of tasks, sending the results or errors back through a channel worker port.

## Symbols

### `workerTaskProcessor`
#### Description
This function sets up a message listener for worker threads and processes tasks using a provided task processor function. It handles both successful task completion and error scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| taskProcessor | Function | A function that processes the task and returns a Promise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a message listener on the `parentPort`.
2. When a message is received, it calls the `taskProcessor` function with the message content.
3. If the task is successful, it sends the result back through the `channelWorkerPort`.
4. If an error occurs, it sends the error message back through the `channelWorkerPort`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| worker_threads | Used to access the `parentPort` for communication between the main thread and worker threads |

## Error Handling
The function includes basic error handling:
- If the `taskProcessor` function throws an error or returns a rejected promise, the error is caught.
- If the error is an instance of `Error`, its message is sent back. Otherwise, the error itself is sent.

## Side Effects
- The function sets up a persistent message listener on the `parentPort`, which will continue to process messages until the worker is terminated.
- Messages are sent back through the `channelWorkerPort`, which affects the state of the communication channel.

## Performance Considerations
This utility is designed for use with worker threads, which can improve performance by offloading tasks to separate threads. However, the actual performance impact depends on the implementation of the `taskProcessor` function and the nature of the tasks being processed.
