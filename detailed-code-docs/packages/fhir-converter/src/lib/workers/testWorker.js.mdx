title: "testWorker.js"
---

## High-level description
This code implements a test worker for a FHIR converter system. It processes different test messages and returns predefined responses or throws errors based on the input, simulating various scenarios for testing purposes.

## Code Structure
The code uses the `WorkerUtils.workerTaskProcessor` to handle incoming messages. It processes these messages using a switch statement and returns promises based on the message content.

## Symbols

### `WorkerUtils.workerTaskProcessor`
#### Description
This function sets up a worker to process tasks. It takes a callback function that handles different types of messages.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| callback | Function | A function that processes the incoming message and returns a Promise |

#### Internal Logic
The callback function uses a switch statement to handle different test cases:
1. "exit": Exits the process with code 2
2. "error": Throws a new Error
3. "msg1": Fulfills the promise with "b"
4. "msg2": Fulfills the promise with "c"
5. default: Rejects the promise with "unknown msg!"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| WorkerUtils | Provides the workerTaskProcessor function for handling worker tasks |
| Promise | Used for asynchronous operations |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling:
- For the "error" test case, it throws a new Error with the message "random error"
- For unknown messages, it rejects the promise with the message "unknown msg!"

## Performance Considerations
This test worker is designed for testing purposes and doesn't have specific performance optimizations. It's meant to simulate various scenarios quickly and efficiently.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
