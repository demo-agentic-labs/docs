## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the output processor module of the FHIR converter. The tests focus on various aspects of resource deduplication, including identifier deduplication, encounter deduplication, and status selection. These tests ensure the correct functioning of the deduplication logic and status comparison in the FHIR conversion process.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify the following functionalities:

1. Identifier deduplication: Ensures that duplicate identifiers are removed from resources, keeping the most complete identifier when there are similar ones with different levels of completeness.

2. Encounter deduplication: Checks that duplicate encounters in a FHIR bundle are properly merged, maintaining the most informative data from each encounter.

3. Status selection: Verifies that when comparing different status values, the most informative status is selected based on predefined rules.

These tests help maintain the integrity and efficiency of the FHIR conversion process by ensuring that the output is properly deduplicated and contains the most relevant information.

## Key Files

1. `deduplicate-identifiers.test.js`:
   This file contains tests for the `deduplicateIdentifiers` function. It verifies that:
   - Empty input results in an empty output
   - Duplicate identifiers are removed
   - The most complete identifier is kept when similar identifiers exist
   - Different identifiers are retained

2. `encounter-deduplicator-inputs.js`:
   This file defines test inputs for the encounter deduplication process. It includes:
   - A template for a FHIR Bundle resource
   - Sample encounter resources with specific attributes
   - An expected merged encounter result

3. `encounter-deduplicator.test.js`:
   This file tests the encounter deduplication functionality. It verifies that:
   - Duplicate encounters are properly merged
   - Non-duplicate encounters are left unchanged
   - Multiple sets of duplicate encounters are correctly handled

4. `select-more-informative-status.test.js`:
   This file tests the `selectMostInformativeStatus` function. It ensures that:
   - Identical status values return the same status
   - "Active" status is preferred over "unknown"
   - When comparing different non-unknown statuses, the first one is returned

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following dependencies:

1. Jest: The testing framework used for all unit tests.
2. @faker-js/faker: Used to generate random UUIDs for test data.

## Configuration
The tests do not require specific configuration files or environment variables. They use predefined test inputs and rely on the Jest testing framework's default configuration.

Here's an example of how the `deduplicateIdentifiers` function is tested:

```javascript
it("removes a duplicate identifier", function (done) {
  const fullIdentifier = {
    system: "urn:oid:1.2.36.146.595.217.0.1",
    value: "12345",
    type: {
      coding: [
        {
          system: "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
          code: "MR",
        },
      ],
    },
  };

  const identifiers = [fullIdentifier, fullIdentifier];

  const result = deduplicateIdentifiers(identifiers);
  expect(result).toHaveLength(1);
  expect(result[0]).toEqual(fullIdentifier);
  done();
});
```

This test case creates an array with two identical identifiers, calls the `deduplicateIdentifiers` function, and verifies that the result contains only one identifier matching the input.

The encounter deduplication tests use more complex input data, such as:

```javascript
const bundle = {
  ...bundleTemplate,
  entry: [
    { resource: encompassingEncounter },
    { resource: internalEncounter },
  ],
};

const result = Process(bundle);

expect(result.entry).toHaveLength(1);
expect(result.entry[0].resource).toEqual(mergedEncounter);
```

This test creates a bundle with two encounters, processes it using the `Process` function from the `resourceDeduplicator` module, and verifies that the result contains a single merged encounter.

These tests ensure that the FHIR converter's output processing module correctly handles deduplication and merging of resources, maintaining data integrity and efficiency in the conversion process.
