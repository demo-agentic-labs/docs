## High-level description
This code implements a JSON processor that parses and processes JSON input using the ANTLR4 library. It defines a `Process` function that takes a JSON string as input, parses it, and returns a processed result using a custom listener.

## Symbols

### `Process`
#### Description
The `Process` function is the main entry point for JSON processing. It takes a JSON string as input, sets up the ANTLR4 parsing infrastructure, and walks through the parse tree using a custom listener to process the JSON.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| input | string | The JSON string to be processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | any | The processed result from the custom listener, or the original input if an error occurs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Create an ANTLR4 input stream from the input string.
2. Initialize the JSON lexer and parser with error listeners.
3. Build a parse tree from the input.
4. Create a custom JSON listener object.
5. Walk through the parse tree using the custom listener.
6. Return the result from the custom listener.

If any error occurs during the process, the function catches the error and returns the original input.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antlr4 | Provides the parsing infrastructure |
| jsonLexer | Custom lexer for JSON tokenization |
| jsonParser | Custom parser for JSON parsing |
| jsonCustomListener | Custom listener for processing the parsed JSON |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling by catching any exceptions that occur during the processing. If an error is caught, the original input is returned instead of the processed result. Error listeners are added to both the lexer and parser to handle parsing errors, but the specific error handling logic is not visible in this file.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses ANTLR4 for parsing, which can be relatively slow for very large JSON inputs. For performance-critical applications, alternative JSON parsing methods might be considered.

## Notes
1. The code is part of a larger FHIR converter project, as indicated by the file path and copyright notice.
2. The implementation relies on auto-generated ANTLR4 code (jsonLexer and jsonParser) and a custom listener (jsonCustomListener), which are not shown in this file.
3. Error logging is commented out, which might make debugging more difficult in production environments.
