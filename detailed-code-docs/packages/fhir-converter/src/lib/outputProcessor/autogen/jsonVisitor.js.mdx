## High-level description
This code defines a `jsonVisitor` class that extends the `antlr4.tree.ParseTreeVisitor` class. It provides a skeleton for visiting different parts of a JSON parse tree produced by a JSON parser. The class is automatically generated from a grammar file and is designed to be used with the ANTLR4 parsing framework.

## Code Structure
The `jsonVisitor` class contains methods for visiting different nodes of a JSON parse tree, including the root JSON object, objects, key-value pairs, arrays, and values. Each method corresponds to a rule in the JSON grammar.

## Symbols

### `jsonVisitor`
#### Description
A class that extends `antlr4.tree.ParseTreeVisitor` and provides methods for visiting different parts of a JSON parse tree.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines five visitor methods, each corresponding to a specific rule in the JSON grammar:

1. `visitJson(ctx)`: Visits the root of the JSON parse tree.
2. `visitObj(ctx)`: Visits JSON object nodes.
3. `visitPair(ctx)`: Visits key-value pair nodes within JSON objects.
4. `visitArray(ctx)`: Visits JSON array nodes.
5. `visitValue(ctx)`: Visits value nodes (which can be objects, arrays, or primitive values).

Each method simply calls `this.visitChildren(ctx)`, which is the default behavior for visiting child nodes. This allows for traversal of the entire parse tree.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antlr4 | Provides the base `ParseTreeVisitor` class and other ANTLR4 runtime functionality |

## Notes
1. This code is automatically generated by the ANTLR4 tool based on a grammar file (`json.g4`).
2. The `// jshint ignore: start` comment at the beginning suggests that JSHint should ignore this file, likely due to its auto-generated nature.
3. The class is designed to be extended and customized for specific JSON processing tasks. Users of this class would typically override these methods to implement custom behavior for each type of node in the JSON parse tree.
4. The `exports.jsonVisitor = jsonVisitor;` line at the end makes the `jsonVisitor` class available for use in other modules.
