title: "jsonListener.js"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a listener class for a JSON parser generated by ANTLR 4.9.2. It provides empty method implementations for entering and exiting various parts of a JSON structure, such as objects, arrays, and key-value pairs.

## Code Structure
The `jsonListener` class extends `antlr4.tree.ParseTreeListener` and defines methods that correspond to different elements of a JSON structure. These methods are called by the parser as it traverses the parse tree.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antlr4 | Provides the base ParseTreeListener class and other ANTLR-related functionality |

## Symbols

### `jsonListener`
#### Description
This class defines a complete listener for a parse tree produced by the `jsonParser`. It extends `antlr4.tree.ParseTreeListener` and provides empty implementations for methods that are called when entering and exiting different parts of a JSON structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | ParseTreeContext | The context object provided by ANTLR, containing information about the current node in the parse tree |

#### Internal Logic
The class defines ten methods, each corresponding to entering or exiting a specific part of the JSON structure:

1. `enterJson(ctx)` and `exitJson(ctx)`: Called when entering and exiting the root JSON node.
2. `enterObj(ctx)` and `exitObj(ctx)`: Called when entering and exiting a JSON object.
3. `enterPair(ctx)` and `exitPair(ctx)`: Called when entering and exiting a key-value pair in a JSON object.
4. `enterArray(ctx)` and `exitArray(ctx)`: Called when entering and exiting a JSON array.
5. `enterValue(ctx)` and `exitValue(ctx)`: Called when entering and exiting a JSON value (which could be a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array).

All these methods are currently empty, serving as placeholders for custom logic that can be implemented by extending this class.

## Notes
1. This file is auto-generated by ANTLR 4.9.2, as indicated by the comment at the top of the file.
2. The code is set up to ignore JSHint warnings, as indicated by the `// jshint ignore: start` comment.
3. The `jsonListener` class is exported at the end of the file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
4. This listener class is typically used in conjunction with a parser and lexer generated by ANTLR to process JSON data in a structured way.
5. To use this listener effectively, you would typically extend this class and override the methods with your own implementations to perform specific actions when different parts of the JSON structure are encountered during parsing.
