## High-level description
This file contains an automatically generated parser for JSON, created using ANTLR 4.9.2. It defines the grammar rules and structure for parsing JSON data, including objects, arrays, key-value pairs, and various value types.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `jsonParser` class that extends `antlr4.Parser`. This class contains methods for parsing different elements of JSON syntax, such as `json()`, `obj()`, `pair()`, `array()`, and `value()`. It also defines context classes for each rule, which are used to represent the parse tree nodes.

### `jsonParser` class
#### Description
This is the main parser class for JSON, extending `antlr4.Parser`. It defines the grammar rules and methods for parsing JSON structures.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines token types and rule names for JSON elements
- Implements parsing methods for each JSON structure (object, array, pair, value)
- Uses ANTLR-generated code to handle parsing logic and error recovery

### Parsing Methods
#### `json()`
Parses the root JSON structure, which is expected to be an object.

#### `obj()`
Parses JSON objects, handling nested key-value pairs and commas.

#### `pair()`
Parses key-value pairs within JSON objects.

#### `array()`
Parses JSON arrays, handling nested values and commas.

#### `value()`
Parses various JSON value types, including strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null.

### Context Classes
For each parsing rule (`JsonContext`, `ObjContext`, `PairContext`, `ArrayContext`, `ValueContext`), there's a corresponding context class that represents the parse tree node for that rule.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antlr4 | Provides the core functionality for the generated parser |
| jsonListener | Defines listener interface for traversing the parse tree |
| jsonVisitor | Defines visitor interface for traversing the parse tree |

## Performance Considerations
As this is an automatically generated parser, its performance characteristics are largely determined by the ANTLR runtime and the complexity of the input JSON. For large JSON structures, parsing may be computationally expensive.

## Error Handling
The parser includes built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms provided by ANTLR. These allow the parser to continue parsing even when encountering syntax errors in the input JSON.
