title: "jsonLexer.js"

## High-level description
This code defines a lexer for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) using the ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) framework. The lexer is responsible for tokenizing JSON input, breaking it down into individual elements such as brackets, commas, strings, numbers, and keywords.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single class, `jsonLexer`, which extends `antlr4.Lexer`. This class contains static properties defining the grammar rules, token types, and other lexer-specific information. The actual tokenization logic is implemented by ANTLR based on these definitions.

## Symbols

### `jsonLexer`
#### Description
This class represents the lexer for JSON. It defines the rules for tokenizing JSON input and provides methods for the ANTLR runtime to perform the lexical analysis.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| input | antlr4.InputStream | The input stream containing the JSON text to be tokenized |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class defines various token types using static properties (e.g., `T__0`, `T__1`, `STRING`, `NUMBER`).
2. It specifies grammar rules using the `ruleNames` array, which includes rules for recognizing JSON elements like brackets, strings, numbers, and whitespace.
3. The `literalNames` array defines literal tokens like '{', '}', 'true', 'false', and 'null'.
4. The `symbolicNames` array assigns symbolic names to token types.
5. The constructor initializes the lexer with the given input and sets up the ANTLR lexer simulator.
6. The `atn` getter returns the Augmented Transition Network used by ANTLR for lexical analysis.

#### Performance Considerations
The lexer is generated by ANTLR, which is designed for efficient lexical analysis. The use of a pre-computed Augmented Transition Network (ATN) allows for fast token recognition.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antlr4 | Provides the core functionality for lexical analysis and parsing |

## Error Handling
Error handling in this lexer is primarily managed by the ANTLR runtime. The lexer will throw exceptions for invalid input that doesn't match any of the defined token patterns.

## API/Interface Reference
The main interface of this lexer is implicit, as it's designed to be used by an ANTLR-generated parser. The key method used by the parser would be:

| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| nextToken() | Returns the next token from the input stream |

Note: This method is provided by the parent `antlr4.Lexer` class and is not explicitly defined in this file.
