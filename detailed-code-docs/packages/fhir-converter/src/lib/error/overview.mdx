## High-level description
This code defines error codes and a function to create error messages for a FHIR converter application. It provides a standardized way to handle and report errors across the application.

## Symbols

### `errorCodes`
#### Description
An object that defines a set of error codes used throughout the application.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| errorCodes | Object | An object containing key-value pairs of error code names and their string representations |

### `errorMessage`
#### Description
A function that creates a standardized error message object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| errorCode | string | The error code from the `errorCodes` object |
| errorMessage | string | A descriptive message for the error |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | Object | An object containing the error code and message |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates and returns an object with an `error` property, which contains the `code` and `message` of the error.

## Dependencies
This module doesn't have any external dependencies. It only uses built-in JavaScript features.

## Error Handling
This module is central to error handling in the application. It provides a consistent structure for error messages, which can be used across the application to report errors in a standardized format.

## References
The `errorCodes` and `errorMessage` are used in other parts of the application, such as:
1. In `routes.js`, where they are imported and used to create error responses in API endpoints.
2. In `cache.js`, where they are used to create standardized error messages for file system operations.

These references indicate that this error handling mechanism is used consistently throughout the application for various types of errors, including HTTP errors, file system errors, and possibly others.
