## High-level description
This directory contains the core functionality for the handlebars-converter module of the FHIR Converter. It includes the main converter logic, a collection of custom Handlebars helpers, and a comprehensive test suite. The module is designed to facilitate the conversion of health data between different formats, particularly from C-CDA to FHIR R4, using Handlebars templates.

## What does it do?
The handlebars-converter module performs the following key functions:

1. Creates and manages Handlebars instances for different data types in the FHIR conversion process.
2. Provides a rich set of custom Handlebars helper functions that assist in data manipulation, formatting, and conditional logic during the conversion process.
3. Handles template evaluation, including partial resolution and custom helper registration.
4. Processes various date-time formats, reference ranges, and presented form entries.
5. Performs unit conversions and handles null flavor concepts from HL7 standards.
6. Ensures the reliability and accuracy of the conversion process through comprehensive unit testing.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this module is the `handlebars-converter.js` file, which exports the `instance` function. This function is responsible for creating or retrieving Handlebars instances for specific data types.

The flow of control typically follows this pattern:
1. The `instance` function is called with specific parameters (data type, template location, etc.).
2. A Handlebars instance is created or retrieved from the cache.
3. Custom helpers from `handlebars-helpers.js` are registered with the instance.
4. The instance is used to process templates, utilizing the custom helpers as needed.

## Key Files

### handlebars-converter.js
This file contains the core logic for creating and managing Handlebars instances. It exports the `instance` function, which is the main entry point for the module. Key features include:
- Caching of Handlebars instances for different data types
- Custom partial resolution logic
- Integration of custom helpers

### handlebars-helpers.js
This file provides a comprehensive set of custom Handlebars helper functions. It exports two objects:
- `internal`: Helper functions used internally within the module
- `external`: An array of helper functions exposed for use in Handlebars templates

Key helper functions include:
- `evaluateTemplate`: Processes Handlebars templates and returns JSON objects
- `getDateTime`: Converts various date-time string formats to a standardized ISO format
- `allValuesInObjAreNullFlavor`: Checks for null flavor values in JSON objects

### __tests__ directory
This directory contains the test suite for the handlebars-converter module. Key test files include:
- `handlebars-helpers.test.js`: The main test file for Handlebars helper functions
- `build-presented-form-templates.js`: Provides test data for building presented form entries
- `extract-range-templates.js`: Contains test data for extracting reference ranges

## Dependencies
The handlebars-converter module relies on several external libraries:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| Handlebars | Template processing engine | Not specified |
| uuid/v3 | UUID generation | Not specified |
| crypto | Hash generation | Node.js built-in |
| zlib | Compression and decompression | Node.js built-in |
| he | HTML entity decoding | Not specified |
| convert-units | Unit conversions | Not specified |

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust functionality for template processing, data manipulation, and various utility operations required in the health data conversion process.

## Configuration
The module does not use explicit configuration files or environment variables. Instead, configuration is typically passed as parameters to the `instance` function in `handlebars-converter.js`. Key configurable aspects include:

- `createNew`: Boolean flag to create a new Handlebars instance
- `dataHandler`: Object containing information about the data type being processed
- `templateFilesLocation`: Path to the template files
- `currentContextTemplatesMap`: Map of template names to their content

In summary, the handlebars-converter module provides a flexible and powerful system for converting health data between different formats using Handlebars templates. It offers a rich set of custom helpers, efficient instance management, and comprehensive testing to ensure reliable and accurate data conversion.
