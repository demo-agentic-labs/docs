## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the handlebars-converter module of the FHIR Converter. It includes tests for various helper functions used in the conversion process, such as extracting reference ranges, building presented forms, and handling date-time conversions. The tests ensure that these helpers correctly process different input formats and edge cases.

## What does it do?
The test files in this directory verify the functionality of key components in the FHIR Converter's handlebars-converter module. They do this by:

1. Defining test data and expected outputs for various scenarios.
2. Testing the extraction of reference ranges from different data structures.
3. Verifying the correct building of presented form entries.
4. Ensuring accurate date-time parsing and formatting across various input formats.
5. Checking the handling of edge cases and potential error scenarios.

These tests help maintain the reliability and accuracy of the FHIR Converter by ensuring that its core functions behave as expected across a wide range of inputs.

## Key Files

### build-presented-form-templates.js
This file contains test data and utility functions for building presented form entries. It defines:
- Base64-encoded strings representing different types of patient data.
- Various component structures used to test different scenarios.
- A `makePresentedFormEntry` function that creates presented form entries from an array of strings.

### extract-range-templates.js
This file provides test data for extracting reference ranges. It includes:
- Input objects representing different types of reference ranges (e.g., intervals of physical quantities, null flavors, non-numeric values).
- Corresponding expected output objects for each input scenario.

### handlebars-helpers.test.js
This is the main test file that uses the data from the other two files to perform unit tests on the Handlebars helpers. It includes:
- A test suite for various Handlebars helper functions, particularly `extractReferenceRange` and `buildPresentedForm`.
- A separate test suite focused on the `getDateTime` function, testing its ability to parse and format various date-time strings.
- A utility function `getHelper` to retrieve helper functions by name.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following internal dependencies:
- `helpers`: An array containing the Handlebars helper functions being tested.
- `functions`: A module containing internal functions being tested, including `getDateTime`.

No external libraries are explicitly mentioned in the provided summaries.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables mentioned for these tests. The test data and scenarios are hardcoded within the test files themselves.

In summary, this directory contains a comprehensive set of unit tests for the handlebars-converter module of the FHIR Converter. These tests cover various aspects of the conversion process, ensuring that the helper functions correctly handle different data structures, formats, and edge cases. This testing suite is crucial for maintaining the reliability and accuracy of the FHIR Converter across different usage scenarios.
