title: "dataHandlerFactory.js"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a factory class for creating data handlers, specifically for CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) data. It provides a static method to create a data handler based on the input data type.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single class `dataHandlerFactory` with a static method `createDataHandler`. It imports the `cda` module from a relative path.

## Symbols

### `dataHandlerFactory`
#### Description
This class serves as a factory for creating data handlers. It has a single static method to create a data handler based on the input data type.

### `dataHandlerFactory.createDataHandler`
#### Description
This static method creates and returns a data handler based on the input data type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dataType | string | The type of data handler to create |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handler | object | An instance of the appropriate data handler |

#### Internal Logic
The method checks if the input `dataType` is "cda". If so, it creates and returns a new instance of the `cda` class. For any other data type, it implicitly returns `undefined`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| cda | Provides the CDA data handler implementation |

## Notes
1. The code currently only supports creating a CDA data handler. If other data types need to be supported in the future, additional conditions and imports would need to be added to the `createDataHandler` method.

2. The code includes a comprehensive copyright and license notice at the beginning, indicating that it incorporates work from Microsoft Corporation and is now licensed under AGPLv3 by Metriport Inc.

3. Error handling is not explicitly implemented in this factory. If an unsupported `dataType` is provided, the method will return `undefined` without throwing an error or providing feedback.

4. The factory pattern used here allows for easy extension to support additional data types in the future without modifying existing code (adhering to the Open/Closed principle).
