## High-level description
This code provides utility functions for escaping and unescaping special characters in strings. It specifically handles escaping and unescaping backslashes and double quotes, which are common special characters in many text formats and programming languages.

## Symbols

### `Escape`
#### Description
This function escapes backslashes and double quotes in the input string by adding a backslash before them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| input | string | The input string to be escaped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The escaped string |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses a regular expression `/(\\|")/g` to match backslashes and double quotes. It then replaces these matches with an escaped version using the `escaper` function.

### `Unescape`
#### Description
This function unescapes previously escaped backslashes and double quotes in the input string by removing the escaping backslash.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| input | string | The input string to be unescaped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The unescaped string |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses a regular expression `/(\\)(\\|")/g` to match escaped backslashes and double quotes. It then replaces these matches with the unescaped version using the `unescaper` function.

### `escaper`
#### Description
This is a helper function used by the `Escape` function to perform the actual escaping of special characters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| match | string | The matched string from the regular expression |
| p1 | string | The first captured group (the character to be escaped) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The escaped character |

#### Internal Logic
It prepends a backslash to the matched character, effectively escaping it.

### `unescaper`
#### Description
This is a helper function used by the `Unescape` function to perform the actual unescaping of special characters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| match | string | The matched string from the regular expression |
| p1 | string | The first captured group (the escaping backslash) |
| p2 | string | The second captured group (the character that was escaped) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The unescaped character |

#### Internal Logic
It returns only the second captured group (p2), effectively removing the escaping backslash.

## Dependencies
This module does not have any external dependencies. It uses only built-in JavaScript features and regular expressions.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the input to both `Escape` and `Unescape` functions is a valid string. If non-string inputs are provided, it may lead to runtime errors.
