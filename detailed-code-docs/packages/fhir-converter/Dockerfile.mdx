title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a Node.js application, specifically for the FHIR Converter. It creates a production-ready Docker image with minimal dependencies, optimized for size and security.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile consists of two main stages: the build stage and the production stage. The build stage prepares the application, while the production stage creates the final, lightweight image.

## Symbols

### Base Image (Build Stage)
#### Description
This stage sets up the build environment using Node.js 18 and prepares the application for production.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `node:18` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/app`
3. Copies the entire application to the container
4. Installs production dependencies using npm

### Prod Image (Production Stage)
#### Description
This stage creates the final production image using a slim version of Node.js 18.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `node:18-slim` as the base image
2. Copies the built application from the build stage
3. Sets the working directory to `/app`
4. Exposes port 8080
5. Sets the entrypoint to `/app/docker-entrypoint.sh`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:18 | Base image for the build stage |
| node:18-slim | Base image for the production stage |

## TODOs
1. TODO: #1810 remove comment about `libcurl4-gnutls-dev` installation if not needed after cleaning up unused FHIR converter code
2. TODO: #1810 remove comment about `chmod` command if not needed after cleaning up unused FHIR converter code

## Notes
1. The commented-out `RUN` command for installing `libcurl4-gnutls-dev` suggests that this dependency might have been needed in the past but is currently not required.
2. The commented-out `RUN` command for changing permissions of `/app/deploy/webapp.sh` indicates that this file might have been important in previous versions but is not currently used.
3. The use of `--only=production`, `--no-fund`, `--no-optional`, and `--no-audit` flags in the npm install command optimizes the installation process for production use and minimizes the image size.
