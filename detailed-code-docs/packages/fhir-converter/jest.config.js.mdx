## High-level description
This file contains the Jest configuration for the FHIR Converter project. It sets up the testing environment and specifies patterns for test file matching and ignoring.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported for Jest to use when running tests for the FHIR Converter project.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| module.exports | Object | Jest configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object defines several key settings for Jest:

1. `testEnvironment`: Sets the test environment to "node", indicating that tests will run in a Node.js environment.
2. `verbose`: Set to `true`, which enables verbose output during test execution.
3. `testPathIgnorePatterns`: An array of patterns for directories that should be ignored when looking for test files.
4. `testMatch`: An array of patterns to match test files that should be executed.

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't explicitly import any external libraries, but it is used by Jest, which is implied to be a project dependency.

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| testEnvironment | string | "node" | Specifies that tests should run in a Node.js environment |
| verbose | boolean | true | Enables verbose output during test execution |
| testPathIgnorePatterns | array of strings | ["/node_modules/", "/dist/"] | Patterns for directories to ignore when searching for test files |
| testMatch | array of strings | ["**/__tests__/**/(*.)+test.js?(x)"] | Patterns to match test files that should be executed |

## Notes
1. The configuration ignores the `/node_modules/` and `/dist/` directories when searching for test files. This is a common practice to avoid running tests in third-party libraries or in compiled output directories.

2. The `testMatch` pattern `"**/__tests__/**/(*.)+test.js?(x)"` indicates that:
   - Tests should be located in directories named `__tests__`
   - Test file names should end with `.test.js` or `.test.jsx`
   - This pattern will search recursively through all subdirectories

3. This configuration is specifically for JavaScript files (`.js` or `.jsx`). If the project includes TypeScript files, you might need to adjust the `testMatch` pattern to include `.ts` and `.tsx` extensions.

4. The `verbose` option set to `true` will provide detailed information about each test being run, which can be helpful for debugging but may produce a lot of output for large test suites.

5. This configuration file is separate from other linting or TypeScript configurations (like the related `.eslintrc.js` file shown), focusing specifically on Jest test runner settings.
