title: "package.json"
---

## High-level description
This package.json file defines the configuration and dependencies for the "connect-widget" project, which appears to be a React-based web application. It includes scripts for development, building, testing, and linting, as well as a comprehensive list of dependencies and development dependencies.

## Code Structure
The package.json file is structured into several main sections:
1. Metadata (name, version, privacy)
2. Scripts
3. ESLint configuration
4. Browser compatibility
5. Dependencies
6. Development dependencies

## Symbols

### Scripts
#### Description
Defines various npm scripts for development, building, testing, and maintenance of the project.

#### Internal Logic
- `clean`: Removes build artifacts and node_modules
- `install-deps`: Installs dependencies without running scripts or funding messages
- `start`: Starts the development server with Git SHA environment variable
- `build`: Builds the project for production with Git SHA
- `build:cloud`: Conditional build for staging or production environments
- `typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking
- `lint` and `lint-fix`: Run ESLint for code linting
- `prettier-fix`: Formats code using Prettier
- `test`: Runs Jest tests
- `test:e2e`: Runs Playwright end-to-end tests

### Dependencies
#### Description
Lists the production dependencies required for the project to run.

#### Internal Logic
Includes various libraries for UI components (Chakra UI), routing (react-router-dom), HTTP requests (axios), state management (React), and development tools (TypeScript, testing libraries).

### DevDependencies
#### Description
Lists the development dependencies used for building, testing, and maintaining the project.

#### Internal Logic
Includes tools for building (craco), testing (Playwright), linting (ESLint), and code formatting (Prettier).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @chakra-ui/react | UI component library |
| @emotion/react | CSS-in-JS library |
| @metriport/api-sdk | Metriport API SDK |
| react | Core React library |
| react-router-dom | Routing for React |
| typescript | TypeScript language support |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | "connect-widget" | Package name |
| version | string | "1.10.2-alpha.0" | Package version |
| private | boolean | true | Prevents accidental publishing |

## Browserslist
Defines the supported browsers for production and development environments.

## Notes
- The project uses Craco (Create React App Configuration Override) for customizing the build configuration without ejecting from Create React App.
- The package includes both unit testing (Jest) and end-to-end testing (Playwright) setups.
- ESLint and Prettier are configured for code quality and formatting.
- The project appears to be part of a larger monorepo structure, given the specific version of @metriport/api-sdk dependency.
