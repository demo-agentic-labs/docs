title: "jest.config.ts"

## High-level description
This file configures Jest for the connect-widget package. It sets up the testing environment, specifies test file patterns, and adjusts the configuration based on whether end-to-end (E2E) tests are being run or not.

## Symbols

### `config`
#### Description
This constant defines the Jest configuration options for the connect-widget package. It sets up the testing environment and specifies which files should be included or excluded from the test runs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This symbol doesn't take any direct inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Config.InitialOptions | Jest configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the preset to "ts-jest" for TypeScript support.
2. Configures the test environment as "node".
3. Enables verbose output.
4. Specifies patterns for files to be ignored during testing.
5. Determines the test file pattern based on whether E2E tests are being run.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @jest/types | Provides TypeScript types for Jest configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| preset | string | "ts-jest" | Configures Jest to use ts-jest for TypeScript support |
| testEnvironment | string | "node" | Sets the test environment to Node.js |
| verbose | boolean | true | Enables verbose output during test runs |
| testPathIgnorePatterns | string[] | ["/node_modules/", "/dist/", "/build/"] | Specifies patterns for directories to ignore during testing |
| testMatch | string[] | Conditional | Specifies patterns for test files to include, based on whether E2E tests are being run |

## Side Effects
The file sets the `ENV_TYPE` environment variable to "dev":
```typescript
process.env.ENV_TYPE = "dev";
```

This may affect the behavior of tests or the application being tested, depending on how this environment variable is used elsewhere in the codebase.

## Notes
1. The configuration uses a boolean flag `isE2E` to determine whether end-to-end tests are being run:
   ```typescript
   const isE2E = process.env.E2E === "true";
   ```
   This allows for different test file patterns to be used for E2E tests versus regular tests.

2. The `testMatch` configuration is conditionally set based on the `isE2E` flag:
   - For E2E tests: `["**/__tests__/**/(*.)+(spec|test).e2e.[jt]s?(x)"]`
   - For regular tests: `["**/__tests__/**/(*.)+(spec|test).[jt]s?(x)"]`

3. The configuration is exported as the default export, allowing it to be easily imported and used in Jest's configuration.

This Jest configuration file provides a flexible setup for running both regular and E2E tests in a TypeScript environment, with appropriate file matching patterns and environment settings.
