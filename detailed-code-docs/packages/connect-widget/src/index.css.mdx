## High-level description
This CSS file defines basic styling for the body and code elements of a web application. It sets up a default font stack, removes default body margin, and applies font smoothing for better text rendering across different operating systems.

## Symbols

### body
#### Description
This selector applies styles to the `&lt;body&gt;` element of the HTML document, which affects the overall appearance of the web page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes default margin (set to 0).
2. Defines a font stack prioritizing system fonts for better performance and native look.
3. Applies font smoothing for improved text rendering on webkit and Firefox browsers.

### code
#### Description
This selector applies styles to the `&lt;code&gt;` element, which is typically used for displaying inline code snippets or blocks of code within the web page.

#### Internal Logic
Defines a monospace font stack suitable for displaying code, prioritizing fonts commonly available on different operating systems.

## Dependencies
This CSS file does not have any external dependencies. It uses standard CSS properties and values.

## Performance Considerations
The use of system fonts in the font stack for both body and code elements helps improve performance by reducing the need to download custom fonts. This approach, known as "system font stack," ensures faster rendering and a native look across different devices and operating systems.
