## High-level description
This CSS file defines the styles for the main App component in a React application. It provides basic styling for the app's layout, header, logo animation, and link color.

## Symbols

### .App
#### Description
Defines the basic styling for the main App component.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the text alignment to center for all content within the App component.

### .App-logo
#### Description
Styles the logo element within the App.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the height of the logo to 40% of the viewport height (40vmin).
- Disables pointer events on the logo, making it non-interactive.

### @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)
#### Description
Applies an animation to the App logo when the user has not specified a preference for reduced motion.

#### Internal Logic
Applies the `App-logo-spin` animation to the `.App-logo` element, making it rotate infinitely over a 20-second linear cycle.

### .App-header
#### Description
Styles the header section of the App.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets a dark background color (#282c34).
- Makes the header take up the full viewport height (min-height: 100vh).
- Uses flexbox to center content both vertically and horizontally.
- Sets the font size to be responsive (calc(10px + 2vmin)).
- Sets the text color to white.

### .App-link
#### Description
Defines the style for links within the App.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the color of links to a light blue (#61dafb).

### @keyframes App-logo-spin
#### Description
Defines the rotation animation for the App logo.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies the starting point (0 degrees) and ending point (360 degrees) of the rotation.
- This creates a full 360-degree rotation effect.

## Performance Considerations
The use of viewport units (vmin) for the logo size and calc() for font sizing allows for responsive design without the need for multiple media queries, which can be beneficial for performance.

## Dependencies
This CSS file doesn't directly depend on external libraries, but it's designed to work with a React application structure, particularly one created with Create React App (as evidenced by the default styles and animation).
