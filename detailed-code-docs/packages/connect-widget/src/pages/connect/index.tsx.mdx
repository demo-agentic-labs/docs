## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ConnectPage` that serves as the main page for connecting user accounts. It handles the user agreement, displays providers for connection, and manages error states. The component uses various utility functions and components to set up the API, manage local storage, and render different views based on the user's agreement status.

## Code Structure
The `ConnectPage` component is the main symbol in this file. It uses several imported functions and components to manage its state and render different views. The component interacts with local storage, the API setup, and handles URL search parameters to configure its behavior.

## Symbols

### `ConnectPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the connect page. It manages the state for user agreement, loading status, and errors. It also handles the initial setup of the page, including storing color mode and redirect URLs, and setting up the API.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses `useState` hooks to manage state for agreement, loading, and errors.
2. It extracts search parameters from the URL using `useSearchParams`.
3. An `useEffect` hook is used to run the initial setup:
   - Stores color mode and redirect URLs in local storage.
   - Sets up the agreement state.
   - Initializes the API.
   - Handles any errors during setup.
4. The component renders different views based on the loading and agreement states:
   - If loading, it renders an empty fragment.
   - If the agreement is accepted, it renders the `ConnectProviders` component.
   - If the agreement is not accepted, it renders the `Agreement` component with an `AgreementFooter`.
5. An `ErrorDialog` is rendered if there's an error.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses `useEffect` with dependencies to avoid unnecessary re-renders and ensure the setup is only performed when needed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @chakra-ui/react | UI component library |
| react | Core React library |
| react-router-dom | Routing library for React |

## Error Handling
The component implements error handling in the `setupConnectPage` function. It catches any errors during the setup process and sets the error state, which then triggers the rendering of an `ErrorDialog` component.

## Side Effects
The component has several side effects:
1. Storing color mode and redirect URLs in local storage.
2. Setting up the API.
3. Managing the agreement state in local storage.

These side effects are managed within the `useEffect` hook to ensure they are only executed when necessary.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
