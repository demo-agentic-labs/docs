### AgreementFooter
#### Description
`AgreementFooter` is a functional React component that renders a footer with a privacy policy agreement text and a "Continue" button. It uses Chakra UI components for styling and layout.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onAcceptAgreement | () =&gt; void | A callback function to be executed when the user clicks the "Continue" button |

#### Outputs
This component doesn't return a value but renders JSX.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses Chakra UI's `useColorModeValue` hook to determine background color based on the current color mode (light/dark).
2. Renders a sticky `Box` component at the bottom of the screen.
3. Displays a divider, agreement text with a link to the privacy policy, and a "Continue" button.
4. When the "Continue" button is clicked, it calls the `onAcceptAgreement` callback.

## Dependencies
The component relies on the following external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @chakra-ui/react | UI component library for React |

## Configuration
This component doesn't have any specific configuration options. However, it uses Chakra UI's theming system, which allows for customization of colors and styles.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `useColorModeValue` hook suggests that this component is designed to work with Chakra UI's color mode system, allowing for seamless switching between light and dark themes.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API endpoint, this component expects to be used as follows:

```tsx
&lt;AgreementFooter onAcceptAgreement={() =&gt; handleAgreementAccepted()} /&gt;
```

Where `handleAgreementAccepted` is a function defined by the parent component to handle the user's acceptance of the agreement.
