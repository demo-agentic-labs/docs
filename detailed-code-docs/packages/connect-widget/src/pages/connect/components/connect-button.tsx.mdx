## Symbols

### ConnectButton
#### Description
A functional component that renders a button for connecting to a provider. It uses Chakra UI components for styling and responsiveness.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isDisabled | boolean | Indicates if the button should be disabled |
| isLoading | object | An object containing loading states for providers |
| isConnected | boolean | Indicates if the provider is connected |
| provider | object | The provider object containing provider information |
| onRedirect | function | Callback function to handle redirection on button click |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useBreakpointValue` to determine the button content and width based on screen size.
2. Renders a `Button` component with conditional properties based on the input props.
3. The button displays different content for connected and disconnected states.
4. The button's width and text content change based on the screen size.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| @chakra-ui/react | Provides UI components and hooks for styling and responsiveness |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useBreakpointValue` hook, which may cause re-renders on window resize events. However, this is generally efficient for responsive design and shouldn't cause performance issues in most cases.
