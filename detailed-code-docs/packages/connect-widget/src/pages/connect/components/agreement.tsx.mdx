## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Agreement` that displays information about how an app uses Metriport to connect health accounts. It presents several key points about data security, health data access, and compliance standards using a series of styled components.

## Code Structure
The main `Agreement` component renders a heading and four `Point` components. Each `Point` component represents a specific aspect of the agreement, such as data security or compliance. The `Point` component is a reusable sub-component that takes props to customize its content.

## Symbols

### `Agreement`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders information about the app's use of Metriport for connecting health accounts.

#### Outputs

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a heading using Chakra UI's `Heading` component.
2. Renders four `Point` components, each with specific icons, titles, and body text.
3. The last `Point` component includes additional footer content with compliance logos.

## Dependencies

## References
The component imports two image assets:
- `hippa.jpg`: HIPAA compliance logo
- `soc2.png`: SOC 2 compliance logo

These images are used in the footer of the last `Point` component to visually represent compliance certifications.

This component is likely used within the `ConnectPage` component (from the related code snippet) when the agreement has not yet been accepted by the user.
