## High-level description
This code defines a React component for an error page in a connect widget. It displays an error message and provides a button to redirect the user either to a custom URL or back to the main page.

## Code Structure
The `Error` component is the main export of this file. It uses various Chakra UI components for styling and layout, and React Router hooks for navigation and URL parameter handling.

## References
- `WidgetContainer` from "../../shared/components/WidgetContainer"
- `Constants` from "../../shared/constants"
- `redirectToCustomUrl` and `redirectToMain` from "../../shared/util"

### Error
#### Description
A functional React component that renders an error page with a message and a continue button.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves search parameters and navigation function using React Router hooks.
2. Defines a `handleClick` function to manage redirection:
   - Checks for a custom redirect URL in localStorage.
   - If found, redirects to the custom URL.
   - Otherwise, redirects to the main page.
3. Renders the error message and continue button using Chakra UI components.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @chakra-ui/icons | Provides the NotAllowedIcon for visual representation of an error |
| @chakra-ui/react | Provides UI components for layout and styling |
| react-router-dom | Provides hooks for navigation and URL parameter handling |

## Side Effects
- Reads from localStorage to check for a custom redirect URL.
- Performs navigation based on user interaction and stored URL.

## Performance Considerations
The component is relatively lightweight, with minimal computation. The main performance consideration would be the rendering of Chakra UI components.

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement explicit error handling, as it is itself an error page. However, it provides a way for users to navigate away from the error state.

## API/Interface Reference
While this component doesn't expose an API, it interacts with the application's routing system and expects certain URL parameters and localStorage items to be set:

| Item | Source | Description |
|:-----|:-------|:------------|
| searchParams | URL | Used for redirection to the main page |
| FAILURE_REDIRECT_URL_PARAM | localStorage | Custom URL for redirection on error |

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
