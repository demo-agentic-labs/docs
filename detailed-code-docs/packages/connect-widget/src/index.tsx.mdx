## High-level description
This code is the entry point for a React application that integrates Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring. It initializes Sentry with specific configuration options, sets up the React root, renders the main App component, and includes web vitals reporting.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary dependencies, initializes Sentry, creates a React root, renders the App component, and sets up web vitals reporting. The main symbols (Sentry initialization, React rendering, and web vitals reporting) are independent of each other but work together to set up the application.

## References
- `App` component from "./App"
- `reportWebVitals` function from "./reportWebVitals"
- `getEnvType` and `getEnvVar` functions from "./shared/util"

## Symbols

### Sentry Initialization
#### Description
Initializes Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring with specific configuration options.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the Sentry DSN from environment variables.
2. Configures Sentry with various options including release, environment, and integrations.
3. Sets up BrowserTracing and Replay integrations.
4. Sets sampling rates for traces and replays (currently set to 0).

### React Root Rendering
#### Description
Creates a React root and renders the main App component within React.StrictMode.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a React root using `ReactDOM.createRoot`.
2. Renders the `App` component wrapped in `React.StrictMode`.

### `reportWebVitals` Function Call
#### Description
Calls the `reportWebVitals` function to start measuring performance in the app.
