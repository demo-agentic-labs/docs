## High-level description
This code defines a `Constants` class that contains various static readonly properties used throughout the connect-widget application. These constants include URL parameters, environment variables, breakpoints, and color values, which are crucial for maintaining consistency and configurability across the application.

### `Constants`
#### Description
A class that serves as a centralized repository for constant values used throughout the connect-widget application. It contains static readonly properties to ensure immutability.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines various constants, including:
1. URL parameters (e.g., `TOKEN_PARAM`, `SANDBOX_PARAM`, `COLOR_MODE_PARAM`)
2. Environment-related constants (e.g., `DEMO_TOKEN`, `CLOUD_ENV`)
3. UI-related constants (e.g., `BREAKPOINTS`, `PRIMARY_COLOR`, `HOVER_COLOR`)

These constants are used across different components and modules of the application to maintain consistency and allow for easy configuration.

## References
The `Constants` class is referenced in several other files within the project:
1. `WidgetContainer.tsx`: Uses `CUSTOM_COLOR_PARAM`, `PRIMARY_COLOR`, `HOVER_COLOR`, and `BREAKPOINTS`
2. `connect/index.tsx`: Uses various URL parameter constants
3. `error/index.tsx`: Uses `FAILURE_REDIRECT_URL_PARAM`
4. `providers.tsx`: Uses `TOKEN_PARAM`
5. `api.ts`: Uses `TOKEN_PARAM`, `DEMO_TOKEN`, and `CLOUD_ENV`
6. `redirect-url.ts`: Uses `SUCCESS_REDIRECT_URL_PARAM` and `FAILURE_REDIRECT_URL_PARAM`
7. `providers.ts`: Uses `PROVIDERS_PARAM`
8. `util.ts`: Uses `SANDBOX_PARAM` and `CLOUD_ENV`
9. `apple.ts`: Uses `APPLE_PARAM`
10. `success/index.tsx`: Uses `SUCCESS_REDIRECT_URL_PARAM`

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Notes
1. The use of static readonly properties ensures that these values cannot be modified during runtime, maintaining the integrity of the constants.
2. The `BREAKPOINTS` object defines responsive design breakpoints, which are likely used in conjunction with a UI framework like Chakra UI.
3. The `PRIMARY_COLOR` and `HOVER_COLOR` constants are used for maintaining a consistent color scheme across the application.
4. Many of these constants are used for handling URL parameters, which suggests that the application relies heavily on URL-based configuration and state management.
