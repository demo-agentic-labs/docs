## High-level description
This code defines an Analytics class that initializes and uses the PostHog analytics library for tracking events in a React application. It provides methods for emitting events and identifying users, specifically tailored for a connect-widget platform.

## Code Structure
The code initializes the PostHog library and defines an Analytics class with static methods for emitting events and identifying users. The class also contains a static object defining common event names.

## References
The `Analytics` class is used in other parts of the application:

1. In `packages/connect-widget/src/pages/connect/components/providers.tsx`:
   - `Analytics.emit()` is called when a user attempts to connect a provider.

2. In `packages/connect-widget/src/shared/localStorage/agreement.ts`:
   - `Analytics.emit()` is called when a user accepts an agreement.

3. In `packages/connect-widget/src/pages/success/index.tsx`:
   - `Analytics.emit()` is called when a connection is successful.

These references show that the Analytics class is used throughout the application to track important user actions and events.
