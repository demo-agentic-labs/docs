## High-level description
This code defines the main `App` component for a React application using React Router for navigation and Chakra UI for styling. It sets up the routing structure for a connect widget with three main pages: Connect, Success, and Error. The app also integrates Sentry for error tracking and monitoring.

## Code Structure
The `App` component serves as the root component, wrapping the entire application with necessary providers and routing logic. It uses `BrowserRouter` for client-side routing, `ChakraProvider` for theming, and `SentryRoutes` for Sentry integration with React Router.

## Symbols

### `App`
#### Description
The `App` function is the main component that sets up the application structure, including routing and theming.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered application structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Wraps the entire application with `BrowserRouter` for routing capabilities.
2. Applies Chakra UI theming using `ChakraProvider`.
3. Sets up routes using `SentryRoutes` (Sentry-integrated version of React Router's `Routes`).
4. Defines three main routes: root ("/") for Connect page, "/success" for Success page, and "/error" for Error page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @chakra-ui/react | UI component library for styling and layout |
| @sentry/react | Error tracking and monitoring integration for React |
| react-router-dom | Routing library for navigation in React applications |

## References
The `App` component references the following imported components:
- `Connect`: The main connection page (defined in `src/pages/connect/index.tsx`)
- `Success`: The success page (not provided in the related snippets)
- `Error`: The error page (defined in `src/pages/error/index.tsx`)
- `theme`: Custom theme configuration (imported from `./Theme`)

## Notes
1. The application uses Sentry for error tracking, specifically integrating it with React Router v6 using `Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV6Routing`.
2. The `Connect` page (from the related snippets) handles user agreement, connection to providers, and error handling.
3. The `Error` page (from the related snippets) displays an error message and provides a way to retry or redirect based on stored URLs.
4. The application uses CSS modules (imported as `./App.css`) for additional styling.

This `App` component serves as the entry point for the connect widget, providing a structured layout and routing for the main functionalities of connecting, displaying success, and handling errors.
