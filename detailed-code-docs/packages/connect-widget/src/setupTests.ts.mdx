title: "setupTests.ts"

## High-level description
This file sets up the testing environment for a React application by importing the `@testing-library/jest-dom` package. It enhances Jest's capabilities with custom matchers for asserting on DOM nodes, improving the readability and expressiveness of tests involving DOM elements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @testing-library/jest-dom | Provides custom Jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes |

## Symbols
There are no explicit symbols (functions, classes, or methods) defined in this file. The file's purpose is to import and set up the testing library.

## Side Effects
Importing `@testing-library/jest-dom` extends Jest's global `expect` object with additional matchers for DOM-related assertions. This affects the entire test environment, allowing these custom matchers to be used in all test files without additional imports.

## Error Handling
This file does not implement any explicit error handling mechanisms.

## Logging
This file does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This file does not expose any API or interface. It's a setup file that enhances the testing environment.

## Notes
1. The commented section at the top of the file provides an example of how the custom matchers can be used:
   ```javascript
   expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)
   ```
   This demonstrates that after importing `@testing-library/jest-dom`, you can use matchers like `toHaveTextContent` to assert on DOM elements.

2. The comment also includes a link to learn more about `jest-dom`: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom

3. This file is typically used in conjunction with Jest's `setupFilesAfterEnv` configuration to ensure these custom matchers are available for all test files in the project.

4. While this file doesn't contain much code, it plays a crucial role in setting up a more powerful and expressive testing environment for React applications, particularly when dealing with DOM-related assertions.
