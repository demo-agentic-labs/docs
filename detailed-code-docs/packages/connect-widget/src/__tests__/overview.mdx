## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the Metriport Connect widget. It includes end-to-end (e2e) tests, unit tests, and shared utility functions for testing. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of the widget, focusing on its rendering and interaction with the Metriport API.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory performs the following tasks:

1. End-to-end testing: It verifies that the Metriport Connect widget renders correctly when accessed with a valid token. This test simulates a real user interaction by creating a new user, obtaining a connect token, and checking if the widget displays the expected content.

2. Unit testing: Currently, it includes a minimal unit test that serves as a placeholder to ensure the test infrastructure is working correctly.

3. Test configuration: It provides utility functions to manage environment variables and configuration settings across different testing environments (development and Checkly).

These tests help ensure that the Metriport Connect widget functions as expected and integrates correctly with the Metriport API.

## Key Files

1. `connect.test.e2e.ts`:
   This file contains the end-to-end test for the Metriport Connect widget. It uses Playwright for browser automation and the Metriport Devices API SDK to interact with the Metriport API. The test creates a new user, obtains a connect token, navigates to the widget URL, and verifies that the agreement page is rendered correctly.

2. `shared.ts`:
   This file provides utility functions for managing environment variables and configuration settings in the test environment. It includes functions to build environment variable names, retrieve environment variables for testing, and get a test configuration object with essential URLs and API keys.

3. `unit.test.ts`:
   This file contains a minimal unit test suite for the connect-widget package. Currently, it includes a single placeholder test case to ensure the test infrastructure is working correctly.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. Playwright (version not specified):
   Used for browser automation in end-to-end testing.

2. @metriport/api-sdk (version not specified):
   Metriport API SDK for interacting with the Metriport API in the end-to-end test.

3. uuid (version not specified):
   Used to generate unique identifiers for creating test users.

4. Jest (implied, version not specified):
   Testing framework used for unit tests and providing assertion functions.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust testing environment for both end-to-end and unit testing of the Metriport Connect widget.

## Configuration
The test suite uses the following configuration options:

1. `widgetUrl`: URL of the Metriport Connect widget
2. `apiUrl`: URL of the Metriport API
3. `testApiKey`: API key for authentication with the Metriport API

These configuration options are obtained from the `getTestConfig()` function in the `shared.ts` file. The function retrieves the values from environment variables, supporting different environments (development and Checkly).

The `shared.ts` file provides utility functions to manage these environment variables:

- `buildEnvVarName(key: string, envType: string)`: Constructs an environment variable name by combining a key and an environment type.
- `envVarForTest(key: string)`: Retrieves the value of an environment variable for testing purposes, handling different environments.

Example usage:

```typescript
const config = getTestConfig();
const { widgetUrl, apiUrl, testApiKey } = config;
```

These configuration options allow the tests to be run in different environments without modifying the test code, making it easier to integrate into continuous integration pipelines.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how the end-to-end test is structured in `connect.test.e2e.ts`:

```typescript
test("check if renders agreement", async ({ page }) =&gt; {
  const appUserId = uuidv4();
  const metriportUserId = await getMetriportUserId(appUserId);
  const token = await getConnectToken(metriportUserId);

  await page.goto(`${widgetUrl}?token=${token}`);
  await expect(page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Agreement" })).toBeVisible();

  await deleteUser(metriportUserId);
});
```

This test case demonstrates the workflow of creating a user, obtaining a token, navigating to the widget URL, and verifying the rendered content.

The `shared.ts` file provides utility functions for configuration management:

```typescript
export function getTestConfig() {
  return {
    apiUrl: envVarForTest("API_URL"),
    widgetUrl: envVarForTest("WIDGET_URL"),
    testApiKey: envVarForTest("WIDGET_TEST_API_KEY"),
  };
}
```

This function retrieves the necessary configuration options from environment variables, making it easy to use consistent settings across different test files.

In conclusion, this test directory provides a comprehensive testing setup for the Metriport Connect widget, covering both end-to-end and unit testing scenarios. The shared utility functions ensure consistent configuration management across different testing environments.
