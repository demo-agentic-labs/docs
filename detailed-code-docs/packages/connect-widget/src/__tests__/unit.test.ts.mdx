title: "unit.test.ts"

## High-level description
This file contains a minimal unit test suite for the connect-widget package. It includes a single test case that serves as a placeholder to ensure the test infrastructure is working correctly.

## Symbols

### `describe` block: "Unit Test"
#### Description
This `describe` block groups related test cases under the label "Unit Test". In this case, it contains only one test case.

### `it` block: "expects true"
#### Description
This test case is a simple assertion that verifies if `true` is equal to `true`. It's a trivial test that always passes.

#### Internal Logic
1. The test uses the `expect` function from a testing framework (likely Jest).
2. It checks if `true` is strictly equal to `true` using the `toBe` matcher.
3. The test is marked as asynchronous with the `async` keyword, although it doesn't contain any asynchronous operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jest (implied) | Testing framework providing `describe`, `it`, `expect`, and `toBe` functions |

## TODOs
The comment "STRICTLY SO UNIT TESTS CAN RUN FOR NOW" suggests that this is a temporary placeholder test. It implies that more meaningful unit tests should be added in the future to properly test the connect-widget package.
