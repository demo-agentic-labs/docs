## High-level description
This code configures Webpack for a React application using Create React App (CRA) with CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override). It specifically disables certain Node.js core modules in the browser environment to prevent potential issues with dependencies that might try to use these modules.

## Code Structure
The code exports a configuration object for CRACO, which modifies the Webpack configuration used by Create React App.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported for use by CRACO. It contains a `webpack` property with a `configure` object that modifies the Webpack configuration.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration sets up fallback values for certain Node.js core modules in the browser environment:
- `https`: set to `false`
- `stream`: set to `false`
- `crypto`: set to `false`

This is done to prevent errors that might occur when certain dependencies try to use these Node.js-specific modules in a browser environment where they are not available.

## Dependencies
This configuration is related to the following dependencies in the `package.json` file:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @craco/craco | Provides the ability to customize the Create React App configuration without ejecting |
| react-scripts | The base scripts and configuration used by Create React App |

## Configuration
The configuration modifies the Webpack resolve options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| resolve.fallback.https | boolean | false | Disables the Node.js https module in the browser |
| resolve.fallback.stream | boolean | false | Disables the Node.js stream module in the browser |
| resolve.fallback.crypto | boolean | false | Disables the Node.js crypto module in the browser |

## Performance Considerations
By disabling these Node.js core modules, the configuration helps to reduce the bundle size and prevent potential issues with dependencies that might try to use these modules in a browser environment. This can lead to improved performance and compatibility of the application in web browsers.

## TODOs
The code includes a comment with a link to a GitHub issue:
```
// https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11889#issuecomment-1114928008
```
This suggests that the configuration is addressing a specific issue related to Create React App. Developers working on this project should refer to this issue for context and potential future updates.
