title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.ref.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically designed for reference projects. It extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration and sets up additional options for compiling TypeScript code in the `src` directory of the connect-widget package.

## Symbols

### Configuration Object
#### Description
The configuration object defines TypeScript compiler options and project settings for the connect-widget package.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration.
2. Specifies the `src` directory and its subdirectories for inclusion in the compilation process.
3. Enables the `composite` compiler option for project references.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./tsconfig.json | Base TypeScript configuration that this file extends |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "./tsconfig.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array | ["src/**/*"] | Defines which files to include in the compilation |
| compilerOptions.composite | boolean | true | Enables project references support |

## Notes
1. This configuration is specifically tailored for reference projects, which are typically used in larger TypeScript codebases to improve build performance and manage dependencies between different parts of the project.
2. The `composite` option in `compilerOptions` is set to `true`, which is crucial for enabling project references. This allows other projects to depend on this one and enables incremental builds.
3. The `include` array specifies that all files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories should be included in the compilation process.
4. By extending `./tsconfig.json`, this configuration inherits all settings from the base configuration file, which may contain additional compiler options and project settings.

This configuration is essential for properly setting up the connect-widget package as a referenceable TypeScript project within a larger codebase or monorepo structure.
