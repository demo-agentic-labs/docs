title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for the "commonwell-jwt-maker" package. It defines compiler options and project settings for TypeScript, extending a recommended configuration and adding strict type-checking rules to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured into three main sections: extends, compilerOptions, and file inclusion/exclusion settings.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object defines various TypeScript compiler options that control how the code is compiled and type-checked.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set to:
1. Target ECMAScript 2020
2. Generate source maps and declaration files
3. Enable decorator metadata and experimental decorators
4. Implement strict type-checking rules
5. Set the output directory to "./dist"
6. Disable the "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature" option

### include
#### Description
Specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Includes all files in the "./src" directory.

### exclude
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Excludes the "dist" and "node_modules" directories, as well as any files in "__tests__" directories.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| @tsconfig/recommended | Provides a base recommended TypeScript configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| target | string | "es2020" | Specifies the ECMAScript target version |
| sourceMap | boolean | true | Generates corresponding .map files |
| declaration | boolean | true | Generates corresponding .d.ts files |
| declarationMap | boolean | true | Generates a sourcemap for .d.ts files |
| emitDecoratorMetadata | boolean | true | Enables experimental support for emitting type metadata for decorators |
| experimentalDecorators | boolean | true | Enables experimental support for decorators |
| outDir | string | "./dist" | Specifies the output directory for compiled files |
| noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature | boolean | false | Disables errors when accessing properties using an index signature |

## TODOs
There is a comment referencing issue #340, indicating that the "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature" option is left off due to its limited impact considering the nature of this package.
