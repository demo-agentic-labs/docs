## High-level description
This file (.eslintrc.js) is an ESLint configuration file for the CommonWell JWT Maker package. It sets up the linting rules and parser for TypeScript code in the project, ensuring code quality and consistency.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single configuration object that defines the ESLint settings for the project.

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported by the file. It defines the ESLint settings for the CommonWell JWT Maker package.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object includes the following key properties:
1. `extends`: An array of ESLint configurations to extend from.
2. `parser`: Specifies the parser to be used for TypeScript files.
3. `plugins`: An array of ESLint plugins to be used.
4. `root`: A boolean flag indicating that this is the root configuration file.

Let's break down each property:

1. `extends`:
   - `'eslint:recommended'`: Uses ESLint's recommended rule set.
   - `'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'`: Extends the recommended rules for TypeScript from the @typescript-eslint plugin.
   - `'prettier'`: Extends the Prettier configuration to avoid conflicts between ESLint and Prettier.

2. `parser`: Set to `'@typescript-eslint/parser'`, which allows ESLint to understand TypeScript syntax.

3. `plugins`: Includes `'@typescript-eslint'`, which adds TypeScript-specific linting rules.

4. `root`: Set to `true`, indicating that ESLint should stop looking for configuration files in parent directories.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @typescript-eslint/parser | Parser for TypeScript files |
| @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin | ESLint plugin for TypeScript-specific linting rules |
| eslint-config-prettier | Prettier configuration for ESLint |

Note: These dependencies are inferred from the configuration and are also listed in the package.json file of the project.

## Configuration
The ESLint configuration is set up to work with TypeScript files and integrate with Prettier for code formatting. It uses recommended settings for both ESLint and TypeScript-specific rules.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this configuration file.
