## High-level description
The `packages/carequality-cert-runner` directory contains a tool designed to run through Carequality certification test cases. It's implemented as a Node.js package with TypeScript, focusing on patient discovery processes within healthcare information exchange systems. The package is set up as a command-line interface (CLI) tool and includes configurations for TypeScript compilation, linting, and package management.

## What does it do?
The Carequality certification test runner performs the following main functions:

1. Sets up a command-line interface for running certification test cases.
2. Configures the environment using command-line options and a .env file.
3. Generates a standardized patient discovery request payload.
4. Initiates a patient discovery request using the IHE Gateway SDK.

The tool simulates the process of querying for patient information across different healthcare organizations, which is crucial for healthcare interoperability. It creates a mock patient record with predefined attributes and sends this information as part of a patient discovery request. This process helps validate that the system can correctly format, send, and potentially receive patient information in compliance with Carequality standards.

## Key Files
1. `src/index.ts`:
   - Main entry point of the application.
   - Sets up the command-line interface using the `commander` library.
   - Orchestrates the overall process of running the certification test cases.
   - Initializes the IHE Gateway and triggers the patient discovery request.

2. `src/payloads.ts`:
   - Contains the `generatePatient` function for creating a standardized patient discovery request payload.
   - Defines the structure and content of the mock patient data used in the certification process.

3. `package.json`:
   - Defines the package configuration, including dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
   - Sets up the CLI command `carequality-cert-runner`.

4. `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.ref.json`:
   - Configure TypeScript compiler options for the package.
   - Enable strict compilation rules and project references.

5. `.eslintrc.js`:
   - Configures ESLint for code linting, extending recommended configurations for TypeScript and integrating with Prettier.

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies used in this project are:

1. @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk (^0.12.0):
   - Provides the `IHEGateway` class for interacting with the IHE Gateway.
   - Implements healthcare information exchange protocols.

2. @metriport/shared (^0.8.0):
   - Provides shared utilities and components.

3. dotenv (version not specified):
   - Used for loading environment variables from a .env file.

4. commander (version not specified):
   - Handles command-line argument parsing.

## Configuration
The application uses a .env file for configuration with the following required environment variables:

```
IHE_GATEWAY_URL=&lt;URL of the IHE Gateway&gt;
XCPD_GATEWAY_ID=&lt;ID of the XCPD Gateway&gt;
XCPD_GATEWAYS_OID=&lt;OID of the XCPD Gateway&gt;
XCPD_GATEWAYS_URL=&lt;URL of the XCPD Gateway&gt;
ORG_NAME=&lt;Name of the organization&gt;
ORG_OID=&lt;OID of the organization&gt;
```

These configuration options are crucial for setting up the IHE Gateway and specifying the details of the organization and XCPD Gateway involved in the certification process.

The application also accepts command-line arguments to specify the path to the .env file, allowing for flexible configuration across different environments or test scenarios.

It's worth noting that the current implementation focuses on patient discovery, with plans to include document query and retrieval functionality in future updates when the corresponding API routes are ready.
