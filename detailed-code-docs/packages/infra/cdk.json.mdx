## High-level description
This `cdk.json` file is a configuration file for AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) in a Node.js-based infrastructure project. It defines the entry point for the CDK app, build and watch settings, and various context configurations for AWS services and CDK behavior.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a JSON object with top-level keys for app configuration, build settings, watch settings, and a context object containing AWS CDK-specific configurations.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
Specifies the entry point for the CDK application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | string | Path to the compiled JavaScript file that serves as the entry point |

### `build`
#### Description
Defines the command to build the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| build | string | NPM script command to build the project |

### `watch`
#### Description
Configures file watching for development purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | string[] | Glob patterns for files to include in watching |
| exclude | string[] | Glob patterns for files to exclude from watching |

### `context`
#### Description
Contains various AWS CDK-specific configurations that influence the behavior of CDK constructs and stacks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various AWS service configurations | boolean/string[] | Configuration flags for different AWS services and CDK behaviors |

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't directly depend on external libraries, but it is used by the AWS CDK CLI and runtime.

## Configuration
The `context` object in this file serves as a configuration section for various AWS CDK behaviors:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| @aws-cdk/aws-apigateway:usagePlanKeyOrderInsensitiveId | boolean | true | Enables order-insensitive IDs for API Gateway usage plans |
| @aws-cdk/core:stackRelativeExports | boolean | true | Enables stack-relative exports in CloudFormation |
| @aws-cdk/aws-rds:lowercaseDbIdentifier | boolean | true | Uses lowercase database identifiers for RDS |
| ... | ... | ... | (Various other AWS service-specific configurations) |

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't expose an API directly, it serves as a configuration interface for the AWS CDK CLI and runtime. The `app` property specifies the entry point for the CDK application:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| node dist/bin/infrastructure.js | N/A | N/A | N/A | Entry point for the CDK application |

This configuration file is crucial for defining how the AWS CDK should behave when synthesizing and deploying the infrastructure defined in the project. It sets up various best practices and configurations for different AWS services that will be used in the infrastructure code.
