## High-level description
This JSON file defines a CloudWatch dashboard for monitoring various AWS services and resources in a production environment. The dashboard includes widgets for monitoring API servers, databases, Lambda functions, ECS services, and other components of the infrastructure.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of a single "widgets" array containing multiple widget objects. Each widget represents a different metric or set of metrics to be displayed on the dashboard.

## Symbols

### Widget
#### Description
Each widget in the "widgets" array represents a visual component on the CloudWatch dashboard. Widgets can display various types of data, including metrics, logs, and text.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| height | number | Height of the widget |
| width | number | Width of the widget |
| y | number | Vertical position of the widget |
| x | number | Horizontal position of the widget |
| type | string | Type of widget (e.g., "metric", "log", "text") |
| properties | object | Configuration properties for the widget |

#### Internal Logic
The internal logic of each widget varies depending on its type. For metric widgets, the "metrics" array defines the data to be displayed, including the namespace, metric name, dimensions, and visualization options.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AWS CloudWatch | Monitoring and visualization of metrics |
| AWS ECS | Container orchestration and management |
| AWS RDS | Database management |
| AWS Lambda | Serverless compute |
| AWS API Gateway | API management |
| AWS SQS | Message queuing |
| AWS OpenSearch | Search and analytics |

## Configuration
The dashboard is configured to monitor resources in the "us-west-1" region. Various widgets are set up to display metrics for different components of the infrastructure, including:

1. API Servers (ECS)
2. Databases (RDS)
3. Lambda functions
4. API Gateway
5. SQS queues
6. OpenSearch cluster
7. IHE Gateway (Inbound and Outbound)

## Error Handling
The dashboard includes widgets for monitoring error rates and status codes for various services, such as API Gateway responses and Lambda function errors.

## Logging
Several log widgets are included to display container insights and performance metrics for ECS tasks.

## Performance Considerations
The dashboard includes widgets for monitoring CPU utilization, memory usage, and various latency metrics across different services, allowing for performance tracking and optimization.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the dashboard configuration. However, the presence of both "old" and "new" API server metrics suggests that there might be an ongoing migration or update process.

This CloudWatch dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the production environment, allowing for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting of various AWS services and custom applications.
