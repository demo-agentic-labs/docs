## High-level description
This JSON file defines a CloudWatch dashboard for a staging environment. It contains various widgets that display metrics for different AWS services such as ECS, RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, and SQS. The dashboard is designed to monitor the performance and health of various components of a system, including API servers, databases, FHIR servers, and Lambda functions.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of a single "widgets" array containing multiple widget objects. Each widget object defines a specific metric visualization on the dashboard, including its type, size, position, and the metrics to be displayed.

## Symbols

### widgets
#### Description
An array of widget objects that define the layout and content of the CloudWatch dashboard.

#### Internal Logic
Each widget in the array represents a specific metric or group of metrics to be displayed on the dashboard. The widgets are positioned using x, y, width, and height properties, and their content is defined by the "properties" object, which specifies the metrics, visualization type, and other display options.

## Key Components Monitored

1. API Servers (OSS and Internal)
   - CPU and Memory Utilization
   - Task Count

2. Databases (API DB and FHIR DB)
   - CPU Utilization
   - Memory Usage
   - IOPS
   - Latency
   - ACU Utilization

3. FHIR Server
   - CPU and Memory Utilization
   - Task Count

4. FHIR Converter
   - CPU and Memory Utilization
   - Task Count

5. Lambda Functions
   - Invocations
   - Errors
   - Duration
   - Memory Usage

6. API Gateway
   - Request Count
   - 4XX and 5XX Errors
   - Latency

7. SQS Queues
   - Number of Messages Received

The dashboard is organized into sections using text widgets as headers, such as "OSS", "Internal/Admin", "FHIR Server", "FHIR Converter", and "Others".

## Performance Considerations
The dashboard uses various statistics (e.g., Maximum, Average, SampleCount) and time periods (e.g., 60 seconds, 300 seconds) for different metrics, allowing for both detailed and overview monitoring of the system's performance.

This comprehensive dashboard allows for monitoring of multiple components of the system, enabling quick identification of performance issues or anomalies across different services and resources in the staging environment.
