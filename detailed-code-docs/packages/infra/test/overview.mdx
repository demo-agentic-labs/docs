## High-level description
This file contains a Jest test suite for an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) infrastructure stack. The test is currently commented out and serves as an example of how to test the creation of an SQS (Simple Queue Service) queue in the infrastructure.

## Symbols

### `test("SQS Queue Created", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is a Jest test case that demonstrates how to verify the creation of an SQS queue in an AWS CDK stack. The test is currently commented out and not active.

#### Internal Logic
The commented-out test follows this structure:
1. Arrange: Create a new CDK app and instantiate the InfrastructureStack.
2. Act: Generate a CloudFormation template from the stack.
3. Assert: Check if the template includes an SQS queue resource with the specified visibility timeout.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @jest/globals | Importing the `test` function from Jest testing framework |
| aws-cdk-lib | (Commented out) CDK core library for defining cloud infrastructure |
| aws-cdk-lib/assertions | (Commented out) Provides utilities for asserting CDK stack properties |

## TODOs
The presence of commented-out code suggests that this test file is a placeholder or template for future infrastructure tests. To make the test functional, the following steps should be taken:
1. Uncomment the import statements at the top of the file.
2. Uncomment the test implementation within the `test` function.
3. Ensure that the `InfrastructureStack` class is properly implemented in the `../lib/infrastructure-stack.ts` file.
4. Add more test cases as needed to cover other aspects of the infrastructure stack.

## Notes
1. The `export {}` statement at the end of the file is used to mark this file as a module, which is necessary for TypeScript to treat the file as a script with its own scope.
2. The commented-out code provides a clear example of how to structure and write tests for CDK stacks, which can be useful for developers who are new to testing CDK infrastructure.
3. The test is checking for a specific property of the SQS queue (VisibilityTimeout: 300), which suggests that this is an important configuration detail for the queue in this infrastructure.
