## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration and dependencies for the "infrastructure" package, which is likely responsible for managing the cloud infrastructure of the project. It includes scripts for building, testing, and linting the codebase, as well as dependencies for AWS CDK, TypeScript, and other development tools.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a standard `package.json` file, containing metadata about the package, scripts for various tasks, and dependencies required for development and runtime.

## Symbols

### `scripts`
#### Description
Defines various npm scripts for managing the project.

#### Internal Logic
- `clean`: Removes the `dist` directory and `node_modules`.
- `build`: Compiles TypeScript code.
- `build:cloud`: Alias for `build`.
- `watch`: Watches for changes and recompiles TypeScript.
- `typecheck`: Runs TypeScript compiler without emitting files.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint on TypeScript files in `bin` and `lib` directories.
- `lint-fix`: Runs lint with auto-fix option.
- `prettier-fix`: Runs Prettier to format TypeScript files.
- `test`: Runs Jest tests, passing even if no tests are found.
- `cdk`: Runs the AWS CDK CLI.

### `devDependencies`
#### Description
Lists the development dependencies required for the project.

#### Internal Logic
Includes TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, AWS CDK, and other development tools with specific versions.

### `dependencies`
#### Description
Lists the runtime dependencies required for the project.

#### Internal Logic
Includes AWS CDK libraries, constructs, dotenv for environment variable management, and source-map-support.
