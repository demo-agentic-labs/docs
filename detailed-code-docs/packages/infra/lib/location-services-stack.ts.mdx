## High-level description
This code defines the `LocationServicesStack` class, which extends the AWS CDK `Stack` class. It creates an Amazon Location Service Place Index resource using AWS CDK constructs. The stack is conditionally created based on the provided configuration and outputs the name of the created Place Index.

## Code Structure
The `LocationServicesStack` class is the main symbol in this code. It uses the `ALS.CfnPlaceIndex` construct to create a Place Index resource and the `CfnOutput` construct to output the index name.

## Symbols

### LocationServicesStack
#### Description
This class represents an AWS CDK stack that creates an Amazon Location Service Place Index. It's conditionally created based on the provided configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | Construct | The parent construct |
| id | string | The ID of the stack |
| props | LocationServicesStackProps | Configuration properties for the stack |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets termination protection to true for the stack.
2. Checks if location service configuration is provided.
3. If provided, creates a new Place Index using the `ALS.CfnPlaceIndex` construct.
4. Creates a `CfnOutput` to expose the Place Index name.

### LocationServicesStackProps
#### Description
An interface that extends `StackProps` and includes a `config` property of type `EnvConfig`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib | Provides core CDK constructs like `Stack` and `CfnOutput` |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-location | Provides the `CfnPlaceIndex` construct for creating a Place Index |
| constructs | Provides the `Construct` base class |
| ../config/env-config | Provides the `EnvConfig` type for configuration |

## Configuration
The stack's behavior is controlled by the `config` property of type `EnvConfig`. Specifically, it uses the `locationService` property:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| locationService | object | undefined | Contains configuration for the location service |
| locationService.placeIndexName | string | - | The name to use for the Place Index |

## Error Handling
The code includes a basic error handling mechanism by checking if `props.config.locationService` exists before creating the Place Index. If it doesn't exist, the function returns early, effectively skipping the creation of the Location Service resources.

## Outputs
The stack outputs the following information:

| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| PlaceIndexName | The name of the created Place Index |

This output can be used by other stacks or external processes that need to reference the created Place Index.
