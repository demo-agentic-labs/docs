## High-level description
This code defines a `SecretsStack` class that extends the AWS CDK `Stack` class. It is responsible for creating and managing AWS Secrets Manager secrets for various components of the infrastructure, including provider secrets, CommonWell secrets, Carequality secrets, Canvas secrets, and analytics secrets.

## Code Structure
The `SecretsStack` class contains a constructor that initializes the stack and creates secrets based on the provided configuration. It uses helper functions like `makeSecret` and `logSecretInfo` to create and log information about the secrets.

## Symbols

### `SecretsStack`
#### Description
A class that extends the AWS CDK `Stack` class to create and manage AWS Secrets Manager secrets for various components of the infrastructure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | Construct | The parent construct |
| id | string | The ID of the stack |
| props | SecretStackProps | Configuration properties for the stack |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets termination protection to true.
2. Defines a `makeSecret` function to create secrets with optional replication.
3. Iterates through different types of secrets (provider, CommonWell, Carequality, Canvas, analytics) and creates them using `makeSecret`.
4. Logs secret information using the `logSecretInfo` function.

### `logSecretInfo`
#### Description
A helper function that creates a `CfnOutput` for a given secret's ARN.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stack | Construct | The parent construct |
| secret | secret.Secret | The secret to log information about |
| secretName | string | The name of the secret |

#### Internal Logic
Creates a `CfnOutput` with the secret's ARN as the value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib | Provides core CDK constructs and classes |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-secretsmanager | Provides constructs for working with AWS Secrets Manager |
| constructs | Provides the base Construct class |
| ../config/env-config | Provides the EnvConfig type for configuration |

## Configuration
The stack uses the `EnvConfig` type from the imported configuration file to determine which secrets to create and how to configure them.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the AWS CDK to handle errors during the creation of resources.

## Side Effects
- Creates AWS Secrets Manager secrets based on the provided configuration.
- Outputs the ARNs of created secrets using `CfnOutput`.

This code is crucial for managing sensitive information securely within the infrastructure. It creates secrets for various components, ensuring that sensitive data is stored and managed properly using AWS Secrets Manager.
