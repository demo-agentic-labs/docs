## High-level description
This code defines a function `createLambda` that sets up a Lambda function for document uploading in an AWS infrastructure. It configures the Lambda with specific properties, grants necessary permissions, and sets up event triggers for S3 bucket object creation events.

## Code Structure
The main function `createLambda` takes a set of parameters and uses them to create and configure a Lambda function. It also sets up S3 bucket permissions and event sources for the Lambda.

## Symbols

### `createLambda`
#### Description
This function creates and configures a Lambda function for document uploading.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lambdaLayers | LambdaLayers | Lambda layers to be used |
| stack | Construct | The CDK construct representing the stack |
| vpc | ec2.IVpc | The VPC for the Lambda |
| apiAddress | string | The API address |
| envType | EnvType | The environment type |
| medicalDocumentsBucket | s3.IBucket | The destination bucket for medical documents |
| medicalDocumentsUploadBucket | s3.Bucket | The upload bucket for medical documents |
| sentryDsn | string \| undefined | The Sentry DSN for error tracking |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a Lambda function using `defaultCreateLambda` with specific configuration.
2. Grants read/write permissions to the Lambda for both upload and destination buckets.
3. Adds an S3 event source to trigger the Lambda on object creation in the upload bucket.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2 | For VPC-related configurations |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-event-sources | For setting up S3 event sources |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3 | For S3 bucket configurations |
| constructs | For CDK constructs |
| ../env-type | For environment type enum |
| ../shared/lambda | For default Lambda creation function |
| ../shared/lambda-layers | For Lambda layers type definition |

## Configuration
The Lambda function is configured with the following environment variables:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_URL | string | `http://${apiAddress}` | The API URL |
| MEDICAL_DOCUMENTS_DESTINATION_BUCKET | string | medicalDocumentsBucket.bucketName | The destination bucket name |
| SENTRY_DSN | string | sentryDsn (if provided) | The Sentry DSN for error tracking |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising.

## Logging
The code doesn't implement any explicit logging mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The Lambda function is configured with the shared layer, which may impact cold start times but can improve performance for subsequent invocations.
