## High-level description
This code defines a `DailyBackup` class that creates an AWS Backup plan for daily backups of specified resources. It allows customization of backup schedules, retention periods, and other backup-related settings.

## Code Structure
The `DailyBackup` class extends the `Construct` class and contains a `backupPlan` property. The class constructor takes `BackupProps` as input and sets up the backup plan based on the provided configuration.

## Symbols

### DailyBackup
#### Description
A construct that creates a daily backup plan for specified AWS resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | Construct | The scope in which to define this construct |
| id | string | The scoped construct ID |
| props | BackupProps | Configuration properties for the backup plan |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| backupPlan | bk.BackupPlan | The created AWS Backup plan |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates input parameters (cronHour and cronMinute)
2. Calculates backup windows based on input or default values
3. Creates a `BackupPlanRule` with the specified schedule and retention settings
4. Creates a `BackupPlan` with the rule and adds the specified resources to it
5. Outputs the Backup Plan ID and ARN

### BackupProps (interface)
#### Description
Defines the properties for configuring the DailyBackup construct.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resources | bk.BackupResource[] | Resources to apply the backup plan to |
| backupPlanName | string | Display name of the backup plan |
| backupCompletionWindow | Duration (optional) | Time window for backup completion |
| backupStartWindow | Duration (optional) | Time window for backup start |
| deleteBackupAfter | Duration (optional) | Retention period for backups |
| moveBackupToColdStorageAfter | Duration (optional) | Time after which to move backups to cold storage |
| cronMinute | number (optional) | Minute of the hour to run the backup |
| cronHour | number (optional) | Hour of the day to run the backup |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib | Provides AWS CDK constructs and utilities |
| constructs | Base class for CDK constructs |

## Error Handling
The constructor includes error checking for invalid `cronHour` and `cronMinute` values, as well as ensuring the completion window is at least 60 minutes greater than the start window.

## Outputs
The construct outputs the Backup Plan ID and ARN using `CfnOutput`.

This code provides a reusable construct for setting up daily backups in AWS, allowing for easy configuration and management of backup plans for various resources.
