## High-level description
This code defines a function `createScheduledLambda` that creates an AWS Lambda function triggered by a schedule. It allows for the creation of Lambda functions that run periodically based on specified cron expressions, with the ability to call a specific URL or execute custom code.

## Code Structure
The main function `createScheduledLambda` uses the `createLambda` function (imported from "./lambda") to create the Lambda function. It then sets up CloudWatch Event Rules to trigger the Lambda based on the provided schedule expressions.

## Symbols

### `createScheduledLambda`
#### Description
Creates a Lambda function that is triggered by a schedule defined using cron expressions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | ScheduledLambdaProps | Configuration properties for the scheduled Lambda |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lambdaFn | Lambda | The created Lambda function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a Lambda function using `createLambda` with the provided properties.
2. If a URL is provided, it sets up the Lambda to call that URL.
3. Creates CloudWatch Event Rules for each schedule expression provided.
4. Associates the Lambda function with the created rules as a target.

### `ScheduledLambdaProps` (type)
#### Description
Defines the properties required to create a scheduled Lambda function.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scheduleExpression | string \| string[] | Cron expression(s) for the schedule |
| entry | string (optional) | Entry point for the Lambda function |
| url | string (optional) | URL to be called by the Lambda function |
| (other properties) | various | Other properties inherited from LambdaProps |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-events | For creating CloudWatch Event Rules |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-events-targets | For setting Lambda as a target for Event Rules |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda | For working with Lambda functions |
| ./lambda | For creating the base Lambda function |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Error management would be handled by the underlying AWS services and the Lambda function's implementation.

## Performance Considerations
- The performance of the scheduled Lambda depends on the frequency of the schedule and the complexity of the Lambda function's logic.
- Multiple schedules can be defined for a single Lambda, which can affect invocation frequency and potential concurrency.

This code provides a flexible way to create scheduled Lambda functions in AWS, allowing for easy setup of periodic tasks or API calls within the infrastructure.
