## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript module that exports a type `DnsZones`. The module is related to DNS configuration in an AWS CDK infrastructure setup, specifically for managing public and private hosted zones in Amazon Route 53.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single type definition `DnsZones` that references two imported types from the AWS CDK library.

### DnsZones
#### Description
`DnsZones` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure for DNS zones used in the infrastructure. It includes both a private and a public hosted zone.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines two properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| privateZone | r53.IPrivateHostedZone | Represents a private hosted zone in Route 53 |
| publicZone | r53.IHostedZone | Represents a public hosted zone in Route 53 |

#### Outputs
As a type definition, it doesn't produce outputs. It's used to type-check objects that represent DNS zones in the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53 | Provides types for Route 53 resources |

The code imports types from the AWS CDK library, specifically from the Route 53 module. This indicates that the infrastructure is likely using Amazon Route 53 for DNS management.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this type can be used as an interface for objects representing DNS zones in the application. Here's how it might be used:

```typescript
function configureDns(zones: DnsZones) {
  // Use zones.privateZone for private DNS configurations
  // Use zones.publicZone for public DNS configurations
}
```

This type definition ensures that any object passed as DNS zones will have both a private and a public zone, helping to maintain consistency and prevent errors in DNS-related operations throughout the infrastructure code.
