## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `buildLbAccessLogPrefix` that constructs a standardized S3 prefix for storing load balancer access logs. It provides a consistent way to organize and access these logs within an S3 bucket.

## Symbols

### `buildLbAccessLogPrefix`
#### Description
This function generates a standardized S3 prefix for load balancer access logs. It prepends a fixed path to the given prefix, ensuring consistent organization of access logs in the S3 bucket.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| prefix | string | A custom prefix to be appended to the standard path |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The complete S3 prefix for load balancer access logs |

#### Internal Logic
The function concatenates the fixed path `"load-balancers/access-logs/"` with the provided `prefix` to create the full S3 prefix.

## References
This function is used in the related file `packages/infra/lib/api-stack/fhir-converter-service.ts`. Specifically, it's used in the following context:

```typescript
fargateService.loadBalancer.logAccessLogs(
  props.generalBucket,
  buildLbAccessLogPrefix("fhir-converter")
);
```

This usage suggests that the function is employed to generate the appropriate S3 prefix for storing access logs of the FHIR Converter service's load balancer.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure JavaScript/TypeScript function that manipulates strings.

## Performance Considerations
The `buildLbAccessLogPrefix` function is a simple string concatenation operation, which is generally very fast and efficient. There are no significant performance considerations for this function.
