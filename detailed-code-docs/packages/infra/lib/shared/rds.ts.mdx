## High-level description
This code defines a function `addDBClusterPerformanceAlarms` that creates CloudWatch alarms for various performance metrics of an Amazon RDS database cluster. It sets up alarms for metrics such as freeable memory, CPU utilization, volume read/write IOPs, ACU utilization, and free local storage.

## Code Structure
The main function `addDBClusterPerformanceAlarms` takes several parameters and creates multiple alarms using a helper function `createAlarm`. Each alarm is configured with specific metrics, thresholds, and evaluation criteria.

## Symbols

### `addDBClusterPerformanceAlarms`
#### Description
This function sets up CloudWatch alarms for various performance metrics of an RDS database cluster.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | Construct | The construct scope in which to create the alarms |
| dbCluster | rds.DatabaseCluster | The RDS database cluster to monitor |
| dbClusterName | string | The name of the database cluster |
| thresholds | RDSAlarmThresholds | Optional. Threshold values for different metrics |
| alarmAction | SnsAction | Optional. The action to take when an alarm is triggered |

#### Internal Logic
1. If no thresholds are provided, the function returns without creating any alarms.
2. It defines a helper function `createAlarm` to create individual alarms.
3. It creates alarms for the following metrics:
   - Freeable Memory
   - CPU Utilization
   - Volume Read IOPs
   - Volume Write IOPs
   - ACU Utilization
   - Free Local Storage

### `createAlarm` (internal helper function)
#### Description
This internal function creates a CloudWatch alarm for a given metric and configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the alarm |
| metric | cloudwatch.Metric | The metric to monitor |
| threshold | number | The threshold value for the alarm |
| evaluationPeriods | number | The number of periods to evaluate the alarm |
| comparisonOperator | cloudwatch.ComparisonOperator | Optional. The comparison operator for the alarm |
| treatMissingData | cloudwatch.TreatMissingData | Optional. How to treat missing data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a CloudWatch alarm using the provided metric and configuration.
2. If an `alarmAction` is provided, it adds it as both an alarm action and an OK action.
3. Returns the created alarm.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudwatch | For creating CloudWatch alarms and metrics |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudwatch-actions | For SNS actions on alarms |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-rds | For working with RDS database clusters |
| constructs | For working with CDK constructs |
| ../../config/aws/rds | For RDSAlarmThresholds type |
| ../shared/util | For the mbToBytes utility function |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DEFAULT_MIN_LOCAL_STORAGE_MB_ALARM | number | 10000 | Default minimum local storage in MB for the alarm |

## Notes
- The Free Local Storage alarm is always created, even for Aurora Serverless, due to compliance controls (SOC2).
- The function uses the `mbToBytes` utility to convert MB to bytes for certain thresholds.
