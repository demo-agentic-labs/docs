#### Inputs
N/A (This is a constant value)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| vCPU | number | The number of virtual CPU units, set to 1024 |

## Dependencies

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| vCPU | number | 1024 | Represents the number of virtual CPU units for a Fargate task or service |

## Performance Considerations
In the context of AWS Fargate, the vCPU value directly affects the computational resources allocated to a task or service. A value of 1024 typically corresponds to 1 vCPU, which is a moderate amount of processing power. Adjusting this value would impact the performance and cost of the Fargate tasks or services that use it.
