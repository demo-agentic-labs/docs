## High-level description
This code defines a function `addDefaultMetricsToTargetGroup` that adds default CloudWatch metrics and alarms to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) target group. It sets up alarms for unhealthy host count and HTTP 5xx errors, which are common indicators of issues in a web application.

### `addDefaultMetricsToTargetGroup`
#### Description
This function adds two default CloudWatch alarms to a given Application Load Balancer target group: one for unhealthy host count and another for HTTP 5xx errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| targetGroup | ApplicationTargetGroup | The ALB target group to add metrics to |
| scope | Construct | The CDK construct scope |
| id | string | An identifier for the alarms |
| idx | number | Optional index for multiple target groups (default: 0) |
| alarmAction | SnsAction | Optional SNS action for alarm notifications |

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a unique name for the alarms using the provided `id` and `idx`.
2. Adds an alarm for unhealthy host count:
   - Threshold: 1
   - Evaluation period: 1
   - Comparison operator: Greater than or equal to threshold
3. Adds an alarm for HTTP 5xx errors:
   - Threshold: 5
   - Evaluation period: 1
   - Comparison operator: Greater than or equal to threshold
4. Both alarms are set to not breach when missing data.
5. If provided, attaches the `alarmAction` to both alarms.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudwatch | Importing CloudWatch-related types and enums |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudwatch-actions | Importing SNS action for alarms |
| aws-cdk-lib/aws-elasticloadbalancingv2 | Importing ALB-related types |
| constructs | Importing the Construct type |
| ../shared/cloudwatch-metric | Importing the `addAlarmToMetric` function |

## References
The `addDefaultMetricsToTargetGroup` function is used in the related file `packages/infra/lib/api-stack/fhir-converter-service.ts`. It's called to add default metrics to the target group of a Fargate service running a FHIR converter application.

## Performance Considerations
The function sets up CloudWatch alarms, which may incur additional costs depending on the AWS pricing for CloudWatch metrics and alarms. The alarms are configured with relatively short evaluation periods (1 period), which might lead to more frequent alarm state changes and potentially more notifications if an SNS action is attached.
