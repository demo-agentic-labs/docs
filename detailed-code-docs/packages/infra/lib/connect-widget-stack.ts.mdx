## High-level description
This code defines a `ConnectWidgetStack` class that extends the AWS CDK `Stack` class. It creates an infrastructure stack for hosting a static website (Connect Widget) on AWS, including an S3 bucket for content storage, CloudFront distribution for content delivery, and Route53 for DNS management.

## Code Structure
The `ConnectWidgetStack` class contains a constructor that sets up various AWS resources. These resources are interconnected to create a complete infrastructure for hosting a static website securely and efficiently.

## Symbols

### ConnectWidgetStack
#### Description
This class represents the main infrastructure stack for the Connect Widget. It sets up all necessary AWS resources for hosting a static website.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | Construct | The parent construct |
| id | string | The stack's unique identifier |
| props | ConnectWidgetStackProps | Configuration properties for the stack |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up variables and constants based on the provided configuration.
2. Creates an S3 bucket for storing website content.
3. Sets up a CloudFront distribution with an Origin Access Identity for secure content delivery.
4. Creates an ACM certificate for HTTPS support.
5. Sets up Route53 DNS records to point to the CloudFront distribution.

### Symbol: CfnOutput
#### Description
This symbol is used multiple times to create stack outputs for important resource information.

### Symbol: cloudfront.OriginAccessIdentity
#### Description
Creates an Origin Access Identity for CloudFront to securely access the S3 bucket.

### Symbol: s3.Bucket
#### Description
Creates an S3 bucket for storing the website content with specific security settings.

### Symbol: acm.DnsValidatedCertificate
#### Description
Creates an ACM certificate for HTTPS support, validated using DNS.

### Symbol: cloudfront.Distribution
#### Description
Sets up a CloudFront distribution for content delivery with specific behaviors and error responses.

### Symbol: route53.ARecord
#### Description
Creates a Route53 A record to point the domain to the CloudFront distribution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib | Provides core CDK constructs and classes |
| constructs | Provides the base Construct class |
| ../config/env-config | Imports configuration types |
| ./shared/lambda | Imports a utility function for Lambda error alarms |

## Performance Considerations
The use of CloudFront as a CDN ensures efficient content delivery with low latency. The S3 bucket is configured with appropriate security settings to prevent public access and ensure encryption.
