## High-level description
This code defines an enumeration called `EnvType` which represents different environment types for a software system. It includes three possible values: production, sandbox, and staging.

### `EnvType`
#### Description
`EnvType` is an enumeration that defines three different environment types used in the application infrastructure.

#### Internal Logic
The enumeration consists of three string values:
1. `production`: Represents the live, customer-facing environment.
2. `sandbox`: Represents a testing or development environment isolated from production.
3. `staging`: Represents a pre-production environment for final testing before deployment to production.

## References
This `EnvType` enum is referenced in several other parts of the codebase, including:
- `packages/infra/lib/lambdas-nested-stack.ts`
- `packages/infra/lib/api-stack/fhir-server-connector.ts`
- `packages/infra/lib/api-stack/ccda-search-connector.ts`
- `packages/infra/lib/api-stack/document-upload.ts`
- `packages/infra/config/example.ts`

These files use the `EnvType` to configure different aspects of the infrastructure based on the current environment.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a standalone TypeScript enumeration.

___

This enumeration is a crucial part of the infrastructure code, allowing for environment-specific configurations and behaviors throughout the application. It enables developers to write code that can adapt to different deployment scenarios (production, sandbox, or staging) without hard-coding environment-specific logic.
