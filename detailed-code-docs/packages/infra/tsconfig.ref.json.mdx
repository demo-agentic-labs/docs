title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.ref.json`) extends the base configuration and specifies compilation settings for the "infra" package. It includes specific directories for compilation and enables composite project mode, which is useful for structuring larger TypeScript projects.

## Code Structure
The configuration file extends the base `tsconfig.json` and adds specific settings for the "infra" package.

## References
This file is referenced in the root `tsconfig.json` file as part of the project's overall TypeScript configuration.

### Configuration Object
#### Description
The main configuration object defines TypeScript compiler options and specifies which files to include in the compilation process for the "infra" package.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration.
2. Specifies directories to include in the compilation.
3. Enables composite project mode.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./tsconfig.json | Base TypeScript configuration that this file extends |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "./tsconfig.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array of strings | ["bin/**/*", "config/**/*", "lib/**/*"] | Specifies which directories to include in the compilation |
| compilerOptions.composite | boolean | true | Enables TypeScript's composite project mode |

## Additional Notes
1. The `extends` option allows this configuration to inherit settings from the base `tsconfig.json` file, which helps maintain consistency across the project while allowing package-specific customizations.

2. The `include` array specifies that all files in the `bin`, `config`, and `lib` directories (and their subdirectories) should be included in the compilation process.

3. The `composite` option in `compilerOptions` is set to `true`, which enables TypeScript's project references feature. This is useful for breaking up large projects into smaller pieces, which can improve build times and enforce logical groupings of dependencies.

4. This file is part of a larger project structure, as evidenced by its reference in the root `tsconfig.json` file. It specifically configures the TypeScript compiler for the "infra" package within the project.

5. The configuration doesn't override any other compiler options, relying on the base `tsconfig.json` for most settings. This suggests that the "infra" package mostly follows the project-wide TypeScript configuration, with the main differences being the included files and the use of composite mode.
