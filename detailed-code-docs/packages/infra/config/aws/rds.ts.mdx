## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript type `RDSAlarmThresholds` that represents thresholds for various Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) alarms. It is used to configure monitoring and alerting for RDS instances, specifically for Aurora Serverless v2 clusters.

### `RDSAlarmThresholds`
#### Description
`RDSAlarmThresholds` is a TypeScript type that defines a set of threshold values for different RDS metrics. These thresholds are used to trigger alarms when the specified limits are exceeded.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| acuUtilizationPct | number | Threshold for Aurora Capacity Unit (ACU) utilization percentage |
| cpuUtilizationPct | number | Threshold for CPU utilization percentage |
| freeableMemoryMb | number | Threshold for freeable memory in megabytes |
| volumeReadIops | number | Threshold for volume read I/O operations per second |
| volumeWriteIops | number | Threshold for volume write I/O operations per second |
| freeLocalStorageMb | number (optional) | Threshold for free local storage in megabytes |

#### Internal Logic
The `RDSAlarmThresholds` type is a simple structure that defines thresholds for various RDS metrics. It includes a comment for the `freeLocalStorageMb` property, indicating that it defaults to 10GB if not specified.

## References
This type is referenced in the related file `packages/infra/config/env-config.ts` within the `EnvConfigBase` type, specifically in the `apiDatabase.alarmThresholds` property. This suggests that `RDSAlarmThresholds` is used to configure RDS alarms for different environments in the infrastructure setup.

## Dependencies
The code doesn't explicitly import any external libraries or modules.

## Configuration
The `RDSAlarmThresholds` type itself serves as a configuration structure for RDS alarms. It allows users to set specific threshold values for different metrics when creating or managing RDS instances.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.

This type definition plays a crucial role in monitoring and maintaining the health of RDS instances in the infrastructure, allowing for fine-tuned control over when alarms should be triggered based on various performance metrics.
