## High-level description
This code defines two types, `ECS_MEMORY` and `ECS_CPU`, which represent memory and CPU configurations for Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) tasks. The file provides detailed information about the valid combinations of memory and CPU values for ECS task definitions.

## Symbols

### `ECS_MEMORY`
#### Description
`ECS_MEMORY` is a type alias for `number`, representing the memory allocation for an ECS task in megabytes (MB). The comments provide a comprehensive guide to the valid memory values and their corresponding CPU options.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ECS_MEMORY | number | Represents the memory allocation for an ECS task in MB |

#### Internal Logic
The comments detail the valid memory configurations and their corresponding CPU options. For example:
- 512 MB to 2048 MB can be paired with 256 (.25 vCPU)
- 1024 MB to 4096 MB can be paired with 512 (.5 vCPU)
- Larger memory allocations allow for more CPU options, up to 122880 MB (120 GB) paired with 16384 (16 vCPU)

### `ECS_CPU`
#### Description
`ECS_CPU` is a type alias for `number`, representing the CPU allocation for an ECS task. The comments provide a detailed guide to the valid CPU values and their corresponding memory options.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ECS_CPU | number | Represents the CPU allocation for an ECS task |

#### Internal Logic
The comments detail the valid CPU configurations and their corresponding memory options. For example:
- 256 (.25 vCPU) can be paired with 0.5GB, 1GB, or 2GB of memory
- 512 (.5 vCPU) can be paired with 1GB to 4GB of memory
- Larger CPU allocations allow for more memory options, up to 16384 (16 vCPU) paired with 32GB to 120GB of memory

## Dependencies
The code doesn't explicitly import any external libraries or modules. However, it references the AWS ECS documentation for task definition parameters.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AWS ECS Documentation | Provides information on valid task size configurations |

## References
The code includes a reference to the AWS ECS documentation for task definition parameters:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size

This reference is crucial for understanding the valid combinations of memory and CPU allocations for ECS tasks.

## Performance Considerations
While not explicitly stated in the code, the choice of memory and CPU allocations can significantly impact the performance and cost of ECS tasks. Users of these types should carefully consider their application's requirements and choose appropriate values based on the provided guidelines.
