## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for an infrastructure project, likely built using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit). It defines various configuration types and interfaces for different AWS services, environment-specific settings, and third-party integrations. The configurations are structured to support multiple environments (sandbox, staging, production) and various components of a health application infrastructure.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a comprehensive configuration framework for setting up and managing a complex cloud infrastructure, specifically tailored for a health application. It accomplishes the following:

1. Defines configuration types for AWS services like ECS (Elastic Container Service), RDS (Relational Database Service), and OpenSearch.
2. Specifies environment-specific configurations for different deployment stages (sandbox, staging, production).
3. Sets up configurations for third-party integrations such as PropelAuth, Carequality, and CommonWell.
4. Provides structures for managing secrets, API endpoints, and various S3 buckets.
5. Configures IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Gateway properties.
6. Sets up Lambda function configurations for various purposes, including OpenSearch connectors.

This configuration framework allows developers and infrastructure managers to:
- Consistently set up and manage infrastructure across different environments.
- Easily adjust resource allocations and service configurations.
- Manage security settings and secret names.
- Configure integrations with health-specific services and standards.

## Key Files

1. `env-config.ts`:
   This file is the cornerstone of the configuration structure. It defines the main `EnvConfig` type, which is a union of `EnvConfigSandbox` and `EnvConfigNonSandbox`. These types extend from `EnvConfigBase`, providing a flexible structure for environment-specific configurations.

2. `aws/ecs.ts` and `aws/rds.ts`:
   These files define configurations specific to AWS ECS and RDS services. They provide type definitions for valid memory and CPU configurations for ECS tasks, and alarm thresholds for RDS instances.

3. `ihe-gateway-config.ts`:
   This file defines configuration types for an IHE Gateway service, including ECS task properties, Java runtime properties, and general IHE Gateway properties.

4. `open-search-config.ts`:
   This file provides configuration types for OpenSearch clusters and associated Lambda functions.

5. `example.ts`:
   This file demonstrates how to use the configuration types by providing a sample production environment configuration.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies used across these configuration files are:

1. AWS CDK Library (`aws-cdk-lib`): Used for defining AWS resource configurations and importing types like `Duration`.
2. AWS CDK EC2 Library (`aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2`): Used for EC2-specific configurations.

These dependencies are crucial for defining infrastructure as code using AWS CDK.

## Configuration
The configuration structure is highly modular and extensible. Key configuration areas include:

1. Environment settings (sandbox, staging, production)
2. AWS service configurations (ECS, RDS, OpenSearch)
3. API and database settings
4. Authentication and security configurations
5. Third-party service integrations
6. S3 bucket configurations
7. Secret management

The `EnvConfigBase` interface in `env-config.ts` provides a comprehensive view of the configurable options, including database settings, API endpoints, secret names, and various service-specific configurations.

For example, the RDS configuration allows setting alarm thresholds:

```typescript
const alarmThresholds: RDSAlarmThresholds = {
  acuUtilizationPct: 80,
  cpuUtilizationPct: 70,
  freeableMemoryMb: 1024,
  volumeReadIops: 1000,
  volumeWriteIops: 500,
  freeLocalStorageMb: 5120 // 5 GB
};
```

The configuration structure is designed to be flexible and allow for easy additions or modifications as the infrastructure requirements evolve.

In conclusion, this configuration directory provides a robust and flexible framework for managing complex cloud infrastructure for a health application, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments and easy management of various AWS services and third-party integrations.
