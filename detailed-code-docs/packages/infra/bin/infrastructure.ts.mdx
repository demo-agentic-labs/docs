## High-level description
This code defines an infrastructure stack using AWS CDK for deploying various AWS resources. It sets up multiple stacks including API, Connect Widget, IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise), Location Services, and Secrets. The main functionality is to create and configure these stacks based on the provided environment configuration.

## Code Structure
The main `infrastructure.ts` file orchestrates the deployment of different stacks. It imports configurations and stack definitions from other files and creates instances of these stacks based on the environment configuration. The stacks are interdependent, with the Secrets stack being deployed first, followed by other stacks that may depend on the secrets.

## Symbols

### `deploy` function
#### Description
This asynchronous function is responsible for deploying all the stacks based on the provided configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | EnvConfig | Environment configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the AWS environment using the account and region from the configuration.
2. Deploys the SecretsStack first.
3. Conditionally deploys the LocationServicesStack if configured.
4. Deploys the APIStack.
5. Conditionally deploys the IHEStack if configured.
6. Conditionally deploys the ConnectWidgetStack for non-sandbox environments.
7. Synthesizes the CloudFormation template using `app.synth()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-cdk-lib | Provides core CDK constructs and classes |
| source-map-support/register | Enables source map support for better error tracking |

## Configuration
The stack uses an `EnvConfig` object for configuration, which is initialized using the `initConfig` function from the shared config module.

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, such as checking for the presence of required configuration properties before using them.

## API/Interface Reference
The main entry point is the `deploy` function, which is called with the initialized configuration.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment mentioning the need to set up WAF (Web Application Firewall) in the IHE stack.
