## High-level description
This YAML file defines a load testing configuration for Artillery, targeting a FHIR-compliant server. It sets up authentication, defines test scenarios, and configures various aspects of the load test, including phases, variables, and custom functions.

## Code Structure
The YAML file is structured into several main sections: `config`, `before`, and `scenarios`. The `config` section defines the overall test configuration, including the target server, HTTP settings, plugins, and test phases. The `before` section sets up authentication, while the `scenarios` section defines the actual test flows.

## Symbols

### config
#### Description
Configures the overall test settings, including the target server, HTTP timeout, plugins, test phases, and variables.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the target server URL
- Configures HTTP timeout to 60 seconds
- Sets up CloudWatch metrics publishing
- Defines two test phases: a warm-up phase and a ramp-up phase
- Declares a variable for authentication
- Specifies a processor file for custom functions

### before
#### Description
Defines actions to be performed before the main test scenarios, specifically for authentication.

#### Internal Logic
- Logs a message about getting an auth token
- Sends a POST request to "/auth/login" with email and password
- Captures the authentication token from the response

### scenarios
#### Description
Defines the main test scenario, including steps to create and retrieve a FHIR Patient resource.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a custom function `functionFromProcessor` before the scenario
- Logs a message with a variable from the processor
- Sends a POST request to create a FHIR resource
- Captures the created resource's ID
- Sends a GET request to retrieve the created resource
- Executes custom functions before the request and after the response

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Artillery | Load testing framework |
| CloudWatch | Metrics publishing |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| target | string | "https://yourserver.com" | The base URL of the server to test |
| http.timeout | number | 60 | HTTP request timeout in seconds |
| phases | array | [Warm up, Ramp up load] | Test phases with duration and arrival rates |
| variables.auth | string | "Bearer ....." | Authentication token template |
| processor | string | "./example.js" | Path to the custom processor file |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /auth/login | POST | JSON with email and password | JSON with auth code | Authenticates the user |
| /fhir/R4/ | POST | FHIR resource JSON | Created resource with ID | Creates a FHIR resource |
| /fhir/R4/Patient/{id} | GET | - | FHIR Patient resource | Retrieves a specific Patient resource |

This configuration file sets up a comprehensive load test for a FHIR-compliant server, including authentication, resource creation, and retrieval. It uses custom functions from an external processor file and implements CloudWatch metrics publishing for monitoring test results.
