## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files and scripts for conducting functional and load tests on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) operations. It focuses on testing both batch and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for two FHIR implementations: HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR. The directory utilizes Artillery.io as the primary testing framework and includes utilities for generating test payloads, processing responses, and verifying the creation and retrieval of various FHIR resources.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up and executes tests that simulate real-world usage of FHIR APIs. The main functionalities include:

1. Authentication: Handles user authentication for Medplum tests to obtain access tokens for API requests using OAuth2.

2. Payload Generation: Provides functions to create random request bodies or specific functional test payloads for various FHIR resources like Patient, Organization, and DocumentReference.

3. Batch Operations: Sends batch requests to FHIR servers, which include multiple operations in a single request.

4. CRUD Operations: Performs individual Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on different FHIR resources.

5. Response Verification: Checks responses to ensure operations were successful and expected resources were created or modified.

6. Resource Retrieval: Performs GET requests for individual FHIR resources to verify their creation and accessibility.

7. Load Testing: Includes configurations for load testing to assess the performance of FHIR servers under various levels of concurrent requests.

8. Metrics Collection: Sets up tests to publish metrics to CloudWatch for monitoring and analysis of test results.

9. Health Checks: Includes specific configurations for testing the health check endpoints of both HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR servers.

## Key Files

1. `base-processor.js`: Defines a function for generating random data using the Faker library, primarily creating unique identifiers (UUIDs) for use in load testing scenarios.

2. `example.js`: Contains three functions used in Artillery.io for load testing HTTP endpoints, serving as hooks for processing requests and responses, and modifying the user context during test execution.

3. `example.yml`: Defines a load testing configuration for Artillery, targeting a FHIR-compliant server. It sets up authentication, defines test scenarios, and configures various aspects of the load test.

4. `fhir/batch/batch.js`: Contains utility functions for generating request bodies and processing responses for batch operations in FHIR tests.

5. `fhir/batch/functional-hapi.yml` and `fhir/batch/functional-medplum.yml`: Define functional tests for HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR implementations respectively, focusing on batch operations.

6. `fhir/batch/load-hapi.yml` and `fhir/batch/load-medplum.yml`: Define load testing configurations for HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR implementations.

7. `fhir/crud-hapi.yml` and `fhir/crud-medplum.yml`: Define load testing configurations for FHIR CRUD operations on HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR servers respectively.

8. `healthcheck-hapi.yml` and `healthcheck-medplum.yml`: Define load testing configurations specifically for the health check endpoints of HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR servers.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies used in this directory are:

1. Artillery.io: The primary testing framework used for both functional and load testing.
2. @faker-js/faker: Used for generating random data in test payloads.
3. CloudWatch: Used for publishing metrics from the tests.
4. fs (Node.js File System module): Used for file operations in batch tests.

## Configuration
The test configurations use several environment variables and settings:

1. HAPI_URL / MEDPLUM_URL: The base URL of the FHIR server being tested.
2. REGION: AWS region for CloudWatch metrics.
3. HAPI_TENANT_ID: Tenant ID for HAPI FHIR requests.
4. MEDPLUM_USER / MEDPLUM_PASSWORD: Credentials for Medplum authentication.

Test phases typically include:
- Warm-up phase: To initialize the system under test.
- Ramp-up phases: To gradually increase the load.

HTTP timeouts and other Artillery-specific configurations are set in the YAML files. The tests use custom JavaScript functions for generating payloads and processing responses, which are referenced in the YAML configurations.

This directory provides a comprehensive set of tools and configurations for testing FHIR operations, covering both functional correctness and performance under load for different FHIR server implementations. It allows for thorough testing of batch operations, individual CRUD operations, and health checks on various FHIR resources and server implementations.
