title: "healthcheck-hapi.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a load testing configuration for Artillery, targeting a HAPI FHIR server. It specifies a series of HTTP GET requests to the server's root endpoint to perform a health check, with a gradually increasing load over time.

## Code Structure
The configuration is divided into three main sections: `config`, `phases`, and `scenarios`, which define the test environment, load patterns, and specific actions to be performed during the test.

## Symbols

### config
#### Description
Configures the overall test environment and plugins.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the target URL from an environment variable `HAPI_URL`.
- Configures the CloudWatch plugin for publishing metrics.

### phases
#### Description
Defines the load testing phases with varying durations and request rates.

#### Internal Logic
1. Warm-up phase: 10 seconds duration with 10 requests per second.
2. Ramp-up phase: 60 seconds duration, starting at 50 requests per second and increasing to 200 requests per second.

### scenarios
#### Description
Specifies the actions to be performed during the load test.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a single scenario named "Healthcheck HAPI".
- Loops 10 times, sending a GET request to the root URL ('/') in each iteration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Artillery | Load testing framework used to execute this configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| HAPI_URL | string | N/A | The URL of the HAPI FHIR server to be tested |
| REGION | string | N/A | AWS region for CloudWatch metrics publishing |

## Performance Considerations
This configuration is designed to test the performance and scalability of the HAPI FHIR server. It starts with a low load (warm-up phase) and then gradually increases the load (ramp-up phase) to observe how the server handles increasing traffic. The use of CloudWatch for metrics publishing allows for monitoring and analysis of the server's performance during the test.
