## High-level description
This code defines a module that provides a function for generating random data using the Faker library. The primary purpose is to create a unique identifier (UUID) and assign it to the user context, which can be used in load testing or data generation scenarios.

## Symbols

### `generateRandomData`
#### Description
This function generates a random UUID and assigns it to the `id` property of the `userContext.vars` object. It's designed to be used as a callback or middleware in a testing or data generation pipeline.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userContext | Object | An object containing user-specific data, including a `vars` property for storing variables |
| events | Object | Not used in this function, but likely part of the expected signature for compatibility with a testing framework |
| done | Function | A callback function to be called when the random data generation is complete |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return a value directly. Instead, it modifies the `userContext` object and calls the `done` callback.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generate a random UUID using `faker.string.uuid()`.
2. Assign the generated UUID to `userContext.vars.id`.
3. Call the `done` callback to signal completion.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random data, specifically UUIDs in this case |

## Notes
- The function is designed to work with a testing or load generation framework that expects a specific function signature (userContext, events, done).
- Only the UUID generation is implemented, but the structure allows for easy expansion to generate other types of random data if needed.
- The module exports only the `generateRandomData` function, making it the primary interface for this module.
