title: "healthcheck-medplum.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a load testing configuration for Artillery, targeting the Medplum healthcheck endpoint. It sets up a test scenario that gradually increases the load on the server, monitoring its performance and publishing metrics to AWS CloudWatch.

## Code Structure
The configuration is divided into three main sections: `config`, `phases`, and `scenarios`, which define the test environment, load patterns, and specific actions to be performed during the test.

## Symbols

### config
#### Description
Configures the overall test environment and plugins.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the target URL from an environment variable
- Configures the CloudWatch plugin for metrics publishing
- Defines test phases for warm-up and ramp-up load

### phases
#### Description
Defines the different stages of the load test.

#### Internal Logic
1. Warm-up phase: 10 seconds duration with 10 requests per second
2. Ramp-up phase: 60 seconds duration, starting at 50 requests per second and increasing to 200

### scenarios
#### Description
Specifies the actions to be performed during the test.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a single scenario named "Healthcheck Medplum"
- Loops 10 times, sending GET requests to the '/healthcheck' endpoint

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Artillery | Load testing framework |
| CloudWatch | Metrics publishing |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MEDPLUM_URL | string | N/A | Target URL for the Medplum server |
| REGION | string | N/A | AWS region for CloudWatch metrics |

## Performance Considerations
This configuration is designed to test the performance and scalability of the Medplum healthcheck endpoint. It starts with a warm-up phase to establish a baseline, then ramps up the load significantly to stress-test the system. The use of CloudWatch for metrics allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of the server's performance under load.
