title: "crud-hapi.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a load testing configuration for FHIR CRUD operations using Artillery. It targets a HAPI FHIR server and simulates various create, read, and delete operations for Patient, Organization, and DocumentReference resources.

## Code Structure
The configuration is divided into several main sections: `config`, `scenarios`, and various HTTP requests within the `flow` of the scenario. The `config` section sets up the test environment, while the `scenarios` section defines the actual test flow.

### config
#### Description
Configures the load test environment, including target URL, HTTP settings, plugins, test phases, and variables.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the target URL from an environment variable
- Configures HTTP timeout
- Sets up CloudWatch metrics publishing
- Defines three test phases: warm-up, two ramp-up phases
- Sets a tenant ID variable from an environment variable
- Specifies a processor file for custom functions

### scenarios
#### Description
Defines the test scenario "FHIR CRUD HAPI" with a series of CRUD operations on FHIR resources.

#### Internal Logic
The scenario includes:
1. A loop that creates, reads, and deletes Patient resources twice
2. Creation, reading, and deletion of an Organization resource
3. Creation, reading, and deletion of a DocumentReference resource

Each operation captures relevant data for use in subsequent requests.
