title: "crud-medplum.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a load testing configuration for FHIR CRUD operations using Artillery.io. It targets a Medplum FHIR server, authenticates using OAuth2, and performs various CRUD operations on Patient, Organization, and DocumentReference resources.

## Code Structure
The configuration is divided into several main sections: `config`, `before`, and `scenarios`. The `config` section sets up the test environment, plugins, and phases. The `before` section handles authentication, while the `scenarios` section defines the actual CRUD operations to be performed during the test.

## Symbols

### config
#### Description
Configures the load test environment, including target URL, HTTP settings, plugins, test phases, and variables.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the target URL from an environment variable
- Configures HTTP timeout
- Sets up CloudWatch metrics publishing
- Defines three test phases with increasing load
- Sets a variable for OAuth2 code challenge

### before
#### Description
Defines the authentication flow to obtain an access token before running the test scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Performs a login request to obtain an authorization code
2. Uses the authorization code to request an OAuth2 access token
3. Captures the access token for use in subsequent requests

### scenarios
#### Description
Defines the main test scenario, "FHIR CRUD Medplum", which performs CRUD operations on Patient, Organization, and DocumentReference resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loops twice through Patient CRUD operations:
   - Create a Patient with random data
   - Retrieve the Patient by ID
   - Retrieve the Patient by name
   - Delete the Patient
2. Performs Organization CRUD operations:
   - Create an Organization with random data
   - Retrieve the Organization by ID
   - Retrieve the Organization by name
   - Delete the Organization
3. Performs DocumentReference CRUD operations:
   - Create a DocumentReference with random data
   - Retrieve the DocumentReference by ID
   - Delete the DocumentReference

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Artillery.io | Load testing framework |
| CloudWatch | Metrics publishing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MEDPLUM_URL | string | N/A | Target Medplum server URL |
| MEDPLUM_USER | string | N/A | Medplum user email for authentication |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /auth/login | POST | JSON with email, password, codeChallenge | Authorization code | Initiates login process |
| /oauth2/token | POST | Form data with grant_type, code, code_verifier | Access token | Obtains OAuth2 access token |
| /fhir/R4/Patient | PUT, GET, DELETE | FHIR Patient resource | FHIR Patient resource | CRUD operations for Patient |
| /fhir/R4/Organization | PUT, GET, DELETE | FHIR Organization resource | FHIR Organization resource | CRUD operations for Organization |
| /fhir/R4/DocumentReference | PUT, GET, DELETE | FHIR DocumentReference resource | FHIR DocumentReference resource | CRUD operations for DocumentReference |

This configuration file sets up a comprehensive load test for FHIR CRUD operations on a Medplum server, covering authentication, resource creation, retrieval, and deletion for multiple FHIR resource types.
