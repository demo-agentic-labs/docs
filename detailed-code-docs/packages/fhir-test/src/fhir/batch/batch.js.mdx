## High-level description
This code provides utility functions for generating and processing batch requests in a FHIR testing environment. It includes functions to create random request bodies, check operation outcomes, and generate functional test payloads.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are three exported functions: `makeBodyRandom`, `makeBodyFunctional`, and `checkOperationOutcomes`. These functions are designed to work together in a testing scenario, with `makeBodyRandom` and `makeBodyFunctional` generating request payloads, and `checkOperationOutcomes` processing the responses.

## Symbols

### `makeBodyRandom`
#### Description
This function generates a random request body by selecting a random file from a specified directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userContext | Object | Context object for the virtual user |
| events | Object | Event object (not used in the function) |
| done | Function | Callback function to be called when the operation is complete |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return a value directly but modifies the `userContext` object and calls the `done` callback.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads files from a specified directory
2. Selects a random file using faker
3. Reads the contents of the chosen file
4. Parses the file contents as JSON
5. Adds the parsed content and filename to the userContext
6. Calls the done callback

### `checkOperationOutcomes`
#### Description
This function checks the operation outcomes in a response, processes successful entries, and extracts resource IDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requestParams | Object | Request parameters (not used in the function) |
| response | Object | The response object to be checked |
| context | Object | Context object to store extracted IDs |
| ee | Object | Event emitter object (not used in the function) |
| next | Function | Callback function to be called when the operation is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses the response body
2. Filters entries into errors and successes
3. Extracts resource IDs for various FHIR resource types
4. Stores extracted IDs in the context object
5. Calls the next callback with an error if there are any operation outcome errors

### `makeBodyFunctional`
#### Description
This function generates a functional test payload by reading a specific JSON file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userContext | Object | Context object for the virtual user |
| events | Object | Event object (not used in the function) |
| done | Function | Callback function to be called when the operation is complete |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return a value directly but modifies the `userContext` object and calls the `done` callback.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads a specific JSON file ("payload-functional.json")
2. Parses the file contents as JSON
3. Adds the parsed content and filename to the userContext
4. Calls the done callback

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fs | File system operations |
| @faker-js/faker | Generating random data |

## Error Handling
The functions use try-catch blocks to handle errors. If an error occurs, it is logged to the console, and in some cases, thrown or passed to the callback function.
