title: "load-hapi.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a load testing configuration for Artillery, targeting a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) server using the HAPI implementation. It sets up a scenario to test batch operations on the FHIR server with varying load patterns and custom metrics collection.

## Code Structure
The YAML file is structured into several main sections: `config`, `scenarios`, and various subsections within them. The `config` section defines the test environment, plugins, and load phases, while the `scenarios` section describes the actual test flow.

## Symbols

### config
#### Description
Defines the overall configuration for the load test, including the target URL, HTTP settings, plugins, test phases, and variables.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the target URL from an environment variable
- Configures HTTP timeout
- Sets up plugins for metrics publishing and endpoint-specific metrics
- Defines two test phases: a warm-up phase and a ramp-up phase
- Sets a variable for the tenant ID

### scenarios
#### Description
Defines the test scenario for the FHIR Batch HAPI Load test.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a `makeBodyRandom` function before each scenario
- Performs a POST request to the FHIR server with a JSON payload

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| artillery | Load testing framework |
| publish-metrics plugin | Publishes metrics to CloudWatch |
| metrics-by-endpoint plugin | Collects metrics by endpoint |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| HAPI_URL | string | N/A | The URL of the HAPI FHIR server |
| REGION | string | N/A | AWS region for CloudWatch metrics |
| HAPI_TENANT_ID | string | N/A | Tenant ID for the FHIR server |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |

| /fhir/{{ tenantId }}/ | POST | JSON payload | Not specified | Sends a batch request to the FHIR server |

This load testing configuration is designed to stress test a HAPI FHIR server with batch operations. It uses Artillery to generate load and custom plugins to collect and publish metrics. The test scenario includes a warm-up phase followed by a ramp-up phase, allowing for gradual increase in load. The configuration uses environment variables for flexibility and includes custom JavaScript processing through the `batch.js` file.
