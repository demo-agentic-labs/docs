## High-level description
This YAML file defines a functional test configuration for FHIR Batch operations using Artillery.io. It sets up a scenario to test FHIR resource creation and retrieval through batch operations against a HAPI FHIR server, verifying the successful creation and subsequent retrieval of various FHIR resources.

## Code Structure
The configuration is divided into several main sections: `config`, `scenarios`, and a series of HTTP requests within the scenario's flow. The `config` section sets up the test environment and plugins, while the `scenarios` section defines the actual test flow, including batch submissions and individual resource retrievals.

### config
#### Description
Configures the test environment, including the target URL, HTTP timeout, plugins, test phases, and variables.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the target URL from an environment variable
- Configures HTTP timeout
- Sets up CloudWatch metrics publishing
- Defines a single test phase with one arrival
- Sets a tenant ID variable from an environment variable
- Specifies a processor script (`batch.js`)

### scenarios
#### Description
Defines the test scenario "FHIR Batch HAPI Functional" with a series of HTTP requests to test batch operations and individual resource retrievals.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a `beforeScenario` function to prepare the request body
2. Posts a batch request and verifies the response
3. Reposts the same batch and checks for operation outcomes
4. Performs GET requests for various FHIR resources to verify their creation
5. Includes commented-out sections for resources not currently tested or supported

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| Artillery.io | Load testing and functional testing framework |
| CloudWatch | Metrics publishing for test results |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| HAPI_URL | string | N/A | URL of the HAPI FHIR server |
| REGION | string | N/A | AWS region for CloudWatch metrics |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /fhir/{{tenantId}}/ | POST | JSON batch request | 200/201 status | Submit FHIR batch |

## TODOs
- Uncomment and implement tests for Claim and ExplanationOfBenefit resources once Synthea generates them for CCDA
- Implement tests for Encounter and Immunization resources once FHIR conversion is supported
