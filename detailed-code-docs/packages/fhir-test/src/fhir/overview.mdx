## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files and scripts for conducting functional and load tests on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) operations, focusing on both batch and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It includes test scenarios for two FHIR implementations: HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR. The directory utilizes Artillery.io as the primary testing framework and provides utilities for generating test payloads, processing responses, and verifying the creation and retrieval of various FHIR resources.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up and executes tests that simulate real-world usage of FHIR APIs. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Authentication: For Medplum tests, it handles user authentication to obtain access tokens for API requests using OAuth2.

2. Payload Generation: It provides functions to create random request bodies or specific functional test payloads for various FHIR resources like Patient, Organization, and DocumentReference.

3. Batch Operations: The tests send batch requests to FHIR servers, which include multiple operations in a single request.

4. CRUD Operations: Individual Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations are performed on different FHIR resources.

5. Response Verification: After sending requests, the tests check the responses to ensure the operations were successful and the expected resources were created or modified.

6. Resource Retrieval: The tests perform GET requests for individual FHIR resources to verify their creation and accessibility.

7. Load Testing: In addition to functional tests, the directory includes configurations for load testing, which helps assess the performance of the FHIR servers under various levels of concurrent requests.

8. Metrics Collection: The tests are set up to publish metrics to CloudWatch, allowing for monitoring and analysis of test results.

## Key Files

1. `batch/batch.js`:
   - Contains utility functions for generating request bodies and processing responses for batch operations.
   - Exports functions like `makeBodyRandom`, `makeBodyFunctional`, and `checkOperationOutcomes`.
   - Uses file system operations to read JSON payloads and faker.js for generating random data.

2. `batch/functional-hapi.yml` and `batch/functional-medplum.yml`:
   - Define functional tests for HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR implementations respectively.
   - Configure scenarios to test FHIR resource creation and retrieval through batch operations.
   - Include verification steps for various FHIR resource types.

3. `batch/load-hapi.yml` and `batch/load-medplum.yml`:
   - Define load testing configurations for HAPI FHIR and Medplum FHIR implementations.
   - Set up warm-up and ramp-up phases for gradually increasing load.
   - Use custom plugins for metrics collection.

4. `crud-hapi.yml`:
   - Defines a load testing configuration for FHIR CRUD operations on a HAPI FHIR server.
   - Simulates create, read, and delete operations for Patient, Organization, and DocumentReference resources.

5. `crud-medplum.yml`:
   - Similar to `crud-hapi.yml`, but designed for the Medplum FHIR implementation.
   - Includes an OAuth2 authentication flow before running the test scenarios.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies used in this directory are:

1. Artillery.io: The primary testing framework used for both functional and load testing.
   - Chosen for its ability to handle both functional and load testing scenarios for APIs.

2. @faker-js/faker: Used for generating random data in test payloads.
   - Chosen for its extensive library of fake data generators, useful for creating varied test payloads.

3. CloudWatch: Used for publishing metrics from the tests.
   - Integrated through Artillery plugins.
   - Chosen for its ability to collect and visualize test metrics, especially useful in AWS environments.

4. fs (Node.js File System module): Used for file operations in batch tests.

## Configuration
The test configurations use several environment variables and settings:

1. HAPI_URL / MEDPLUM_URL: The base URL of the FHIR server being tested.
2. REGION: AWS region for CloudWatch metrics.
3. HAPI_TENANT_ID: Tenant ID for HAPI FHIR requests.
4. MEDPLUM_USER / MEDPLUM_PASSWORD: Credentials for Medplum authentication.

Test phases are typically configured to include:
- Warm-up phase: To initialize the system under test.
- Ramp-up phases: To gradually increase the load.

HTTP timeouts and other Artillery-specific configurations are set in the YAML files.

The tests use custom JavaScript functions (defined in `batch.js` for batch operations) for generating payloads and processing responses, which are referenced in the YAML configurations.

This directory provides a comprehensive set of tools and configurations for testing FHIR operations, covering both functional correctness and performance under load for different FHIR server implementations. It allows for thorough testing of batch operations as well as individual CRUD operations on various FHIR resources.
