## Notes
1. The package is set as private, which means it's not intended to be published to a public npm registry.
2. The test script is currently a placeholder and will need to be implemented with actual tests.
3. The package uses Faker.js as a development dependency, suggesting that it may be used for generating mock data in tests or development scenarios.
4. The main entry point is set to "index.js", but this file is not included in the provided code snippet.
5. The description field is empty, which could be filled to provide more information about the package's purpose.
6. The author field is empty and could be populated with relevant information.

This `package.json` file appears to be a basic setup for a FHIR-related testing project, with minimal configuration and a single development dependency. Further development would likely involve adding more dependencies, implementing the test script, and possibly adding more npm scripts for various development tasks.
