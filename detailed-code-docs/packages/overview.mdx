## High-level description
The `packages` directory contains a collection of modular components and tools that form the core of the Metriport healthcare interoperability platform. It includes various SDKs, APIs, infrastructure code, and utility packages designed to facilitate healthcare data exchange, processing, and integration across different systems and standards.

## What does it do?
The packages in this directory collectively provide a comprehensive suite of functionalities for healthcare interoperability:

1. API and SDK Development: Implements APIs for medical data exchange and provides SDKs in multiple languages (Java, Python, TypeScript) for easy integration.

2. Healthcare Data Processing: Offers tools for converting between different healthcare data formats (e.g., FHIR, CDA), patient discovery, and document management.

3. Infrastructure Management: Includes AWS CDK-based infrastructure-as-code for deploying and managing cloud resources.

4. Integration with Healthcare Networks: Provides SDKs and tools for integrating with healthcare networks like CommonWell and Carequality.

5. Data Validation and Conversion: Implements validators and converters for various healthcare data standards.

6. User Interface Components: Offers React Native and web-based UI components for healthcare data integration.

7. Serverless Functions: Contains AWS Lambda functions for various data processing and integration tasks.

8. Utility Libraries: Provides shared utilities for common tasks across different packages.

## Entry points
The main entry points vary by package, but generally include:

1. SDK entry points in respective language directories (e.g., Java, Python, TypeScript)
2. API endpoints defined in the `api` package
3. Infrastructure deployment scripts in the `infra` package
4. Lambda function handlers in the `lambdas` package
5. React components in UI-related packages

## Key Files
While each package has its own set of important files, some key files across the directory include:

1. `api/src/app.ts`: Main application file for the Metriport Medical API
2. `infra/bin/infrastructure.ts`: Entry point for AWS CDK infrastructure deployment
3. `sdks/*/index` files: Main export points for various language-specific SDKs
4. `lambdas/src/*.ts` files: Individual Lambda function implementations
5. `shared/src/index.ts`: Exports shared utilities and types used across packages

## Dependencies
The packages rely on a variety of dependencies, including:

1. AWS SDK and CDK for cloud infrastructure and services
2. Express.js for API development
3. React and React Native for UI components
4. TypeScript as the primary development language
5. Various healthcare-specific libraries (e.g., FHIR types, CDA processing)
6. Testing frameworks like Jest
7. Database ORMs like Sequelize

## Configuration
Configuration across packages is managed through:

1. Environment variables for runtime configuration
2. TypeScript configuration files (`tsconfig.json`) for build settings
3. ESLint and Prettier for code style and formatting
4. Package-specific configuration files (e.g., `cdk.json` for infrastructure)
5. AWS service configurations in infrastructure code

Each package typically includes its own README with specific setup and configuration instructions.

In conclusion, the `packages` directory houses a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and services for healthcare interoperability, covering everything from low-level data processing to high-level user interfaces and cloud infrastructure management. This modular approach allows for flexibility in development, deployment, and integration of Metriport's healthcare data exchange platform.
