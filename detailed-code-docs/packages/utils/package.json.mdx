## High-level description
This package.json file defines the configuration, dependencies, and scripts for a utility package called "utils" within a larger project. It includes various development tools, testing frameworks, and libraries for working with AWS services, data processing, and API interactions.

## Code Structure
The package.json file defines the project's metadata, dependencies, and scripts. It includes both production dependencies and development dependencies, as well as various npm scripts for building, testing, and running utility functions.

## Symbols

### Scripts
#### Description
The "scripts" section defines various npm commands that can be run for development, building, and utility purposes.

#### Internal Logic
- `clean`: Removes build artifacts and node_modules
- `build`: Compiles TypeScript files
- `typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking without emitting files
- `lint`: Runs ESLint on TypeScript files
- `test`: Runs Jest for testing
- Various utility scripts for specific tasks (e.g., `mock-webhook`, `fhir-uploader`, `doc-query`, etc.)

### Dependencies
#### Description
Lists the production dependencies required for the package.

#### Internal Logic
Includes libraries for AWS SDK, API interactions, data processing, and various utility functions.

### DevDependencies
#### Description
Lists the development dependencies used for building, testing, and linting the package.

#### Internal Logic
Includes TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, and other development tools.

## Dependencies

| @aws-sdk/* | AWS SDK for various services |
| @medplum/core | Medical data processing |
| axios | HTTP client for making requests |
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation |
| express | Web application framework |
| sequelize | ORM for database interactions |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|

## Error Handling
The package.json file itself doesn't implement error handling, but it includes dependencies like `@sentry/serverless` which can be used for error tracking in serverless environments.

## Logging
While not directly implemented in package.json, the inclusion of dependencies like `@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs` suggests that the package may use CloudWatch for logging in AWS environments.
