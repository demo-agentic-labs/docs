Here's a high-level description of the target file:

The file "develop-fhir-resource-count.json" contains a JSON object that represents the count of various FHIR resources in a dataset. It includes a total count of resources and a breakdown of counts for specific resource types such as AllergyIntolerance, Composition, Condition, and others. This file likely serves as a summary or inventory of the FHIR resources available in a particular system or dataset.

## Code Structure

The JSON object has two main properties:
1. "total": Represents the total number of resources across all types.
2. "countPerType": An object containing key-value pairs, where each key is a FHIR resource type and the value is the count of resources for that type.

## Symbols

### total
#### Description
The total number of FHIR resources across all types in the dataset.

#### Outputs
| Name  | Type    | Description                            |
|:------|:--------|:---------------------------------------|
| total | integer | Total count of all FHIR resources      |

### countPerType
#### Description
An object containing the count of resources for each FHIR resource type.

#### Outputs
| Name         | Type    | Description                                     |
|:-------------|:--------|:------------------------------------------------|
| ResourceType | integer | Count of resources for the specific FHIR type   |

For example:
```json
"AllergyIntolerance": 819,
"Composition": 9445,
...
```

Each key in the "countPerType" object represents a FHIR resource type, and its corresponding value is the count of resources of that type in the dataset.

This file provides a quick overview of the distribution of FHIR resources in the system, which can be useful for data analysis, system monitoring, or resource planning purposes.
