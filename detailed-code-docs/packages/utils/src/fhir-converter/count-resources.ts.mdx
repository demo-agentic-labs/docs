title: "count-resources.ts"

## High-level description
This code is a utility script that counts the number of resources in a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) bundle. It can process either a single JSON file containing a FHIR bundle or recursively search through a directory of such files, providing a consolidated count of resources by type.

## Code Structure
The main function `main()` serves as the entry point, which processes command-line arguments to determine whether to count resources in a single file or a directory. It then calls appropriate helper functions from the `shared.ts` file to perform the counting and display the results.

## References
This code references functions from:
- `../shared/fs`: `isDirectory`
- `./shared`: `countResourcesPerDirectory`, `getResourceCountByFile`

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the resource counting process based on the provided command-line argument.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| process.argv[2] | string | The path to a JSON file or directory |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if a file/directory name is provided as an argument.
2. If the argument is a directory, it calls `countResourcesPerDirectory()` to process all files recursively.
3. If the argument is a file, it calls `getResourceCountByFile()` to process a single file.
4. Outputs the results (resource counts by type and total) to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | For loading environment variables |
| ../shared/fs | For file system operations |
| ./shared | For FHIR resource counting functions |

## Error Handling
The script exits with a status code of 1 if no filename is provided as an argument, displaying a usage message.

## API/Interface Reference
This script is intended to be run from the command line with the following usage:
```
ts-node src/fhir-converter/count-resources.ts &lt;file/folder.json&gt;
```

## Performance Considerations
For large directories with many FHIR bundle files, this script may take a considerable amount of time to process all files recursively. The script processes files sequentially, which could be optimized for parallel processing in future iterations if performance becomes a concern.
