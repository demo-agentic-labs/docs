## High-level description
This Python script analyzes FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) JSON files in a specified directory to count and categorize "dead" resources. It also includes functionality to count Condition resources with categories. The script is designed to help identify potentially incomplete or problematic resources in FHIR data.

## Code Structure
The script contains three main functions: `count_conditions_categories`, `count_dead_resources`, and the `__main__` block. These functions work together to traverse a directory, analyze JSON files, and report on various resource types and their characteristics.

## Symbols

### `count_conditions_categories(directory)`
#### Description
This function counts the number of Condition resources and how many of them have a category field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| directory | str | Path to the directory containing FHIR JSON files |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| condition_category_count | int | Number of Condition resources with a category |
| conditions_count | int | Total number of Condition resources |

#### Internal Logic
1. Walks through the directory and its subdirectories.
2. Opens each JSON file and loads its content.
3. Iterates through the "entry" array in each file.
4. Counts Condition resources and those with a "category" field.
5. Prints the file path and resource ID for Conditions with a category.

### `count_dead_resources(directory)`
#### Description
This function counts "dead" resources, which are resources with minimal content (only resourceType and id, or including meta and identifier).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| directory | str | Path to the directory containing FHIR JSON files |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resource_counts | dict | Dictionary with resource types as keys and their counts as values |

#### Internal Logic
1. Walks through the directory and its subdirectories.
2. Opens each JSON file and loads its content.
3. Iterates through the "entry" array in each file.
4. Identifies "dead" resources based on their content.
5. Counts occurrences of each resource type.
6. Prints file path and ID for DiagnosticReport resources.
7. Handles sub-references in Location resources.

### `__main__` block
#### Description
The main execution block of the script that processes command-line arguments and calls the counting functions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the correct number of command-line arguments.
2. Calls `count_dead_resources` with the provided directory.
3. Prints the counts for each resource type.

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling:
- Skips files that contain a JSON array at the top level instead of a dictionary.
- Exits with an error message if the correct number of command-line arguments is not provided.

## Performance Considerations
The script processes all JSON files in the given directory and its subdirectories, which could be time-consuming for large datasets. It uses file I/O operations and JSON parsing, which may impact performance for very large files or directories with many files.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | File system operations |
| json | JSON parsing |
| sys | Command-line argument handling |

This script is designed for analyzing FHIR JSON data and identifying potential issues with resource completeness. It's particularly useful for data quality assessment and debugging in FHIR-based healthcare systems.
