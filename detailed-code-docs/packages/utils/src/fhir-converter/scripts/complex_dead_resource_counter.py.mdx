## High-level description
This Python script analyzes JSON and HBS files in a specified directory to identify and count "dead responses" in FHIR resources. It focuses on finding specific phrases that indicate a lack of data or information in various resource types, including both plaintext and base64-encoded content.

## Code Structure
The script consists of two main functions: `find_dead_responses` and `find_dead_responses_in_b64`, which analyze different file types. The main execution block calls both functions and prints the results.

## Symbols

### `find_dead_responses(directory)`
#### Description
This function walks through the specified directory, reads JSON files, and identifies "dead responses" in FHIR resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| directory | str | Path to the directory containing JSON files to analyze |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dead_responses | dict | A dictionary containing identified dead responses, their counts, and associated resource types |

#### Internal Logic
1. Walks through the directory and its subdirectories
2. Reads each JSON file
3. Examines specific fields in each resource
4. Checks for predefined phrases indicating lack of data
5. Counts occurrences and tracks associated resource types

### `find_dead_responses_in_b64(directory)`
#### Description
This function analyzes HBS files in the specified directory, focusing on base64-encoded content within Observation resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| directory | str | Path to the directory containing HBS files to analyze |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dead_responses | dict | A dictionary containing identified dead responses in base64-encoded content, their counts, and associated resource types |

#### Internal Logic
1. Walks through the directory and its subdirectories
2. Reads each HBS file containing "Observation"
3. Identifies base64-encoded content
4. Decodes the content and checks for predefined phrases
5. Counts occurrences and tracks associated resource types

### Main Execution Block
#### Description
The main execution block processes command-line arguments, calls the analysis functions, and prints the results.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for correct command-line usage
2. Calls `find_dead_responses` and prints results
3. Calls `find_dead_responses_in_b64` and prints results
4. Calculates and prints the total count of resources with dead responses

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | File system operations |
| json | JSON parsing |
| sys | Command-line argument handling |
| base64 | Decoding base64-encoded strings |

## TODOs
- The script needs to process the base64-encoded content, as indicated by the comment: "TODO gotta get the ones in the b64 still"

This script is a useful tool for identifying and quantifying instances where FHIR resources contain placeholder or null responses, which can be valuable for data quality assessment and improvement in healthcare information systems.
