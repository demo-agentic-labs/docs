## High-level description
This directory contains Python scripts designed to analyze and process FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data. The scripts focus on identifying and counting "dead" or incomplete resources within FHIR JSON files, as well as analyzing specific resource types like Conditions. These tools are valuable for assessing data quality and identifying potential issues in FHIR-based healthcare information systems.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Analyze JSON and HBS files in a specified directory to identify and count "dead responses" in FHIR resources. These are responses that indicate a lack of data or information.

2. Count and categorize "dead" resources, which are resources with minimal content (only resourceType and id, or including meta and identifier).

3. Specifically count Condition resources and how many of them have a category field.

4. Examine both plaintext and base64-encoded content within the FHIR resources.

5. Provide detailed reports on the findings, including counts of different resource types, occurrences of specific phrases indicating lack of data, and file paths for certain resource types.

These processes help healthcare professionals and data analysts identify potential data quality issues, incomplete records, or areas where data collection or processing might need improvement.

## Key Files

### complex_dead_resource_counter.py
This script focuses on identifying and counting "dead responses" in FHIR resources. It analyzes both JSON and HBS files, including base64-encoded content. Key features include:

- `find_dead_responses(directory)`: Analyzes JSON files to identify dead responses.
- `find_dead_responses_in_b64(directory)`: Analyzes HBS files, focusing on base64-encoded content within Observation resources.
- Counts occurrences of predefined phrases indicating lack of data.
- Tracks associated resource types for each dead response.

### dead_resource_counter.py
This script counts and categorizes "dead" resources in FHIR JSON files. Key features include:

- `count_conditions_categories(directory)`: Counts Condition resources and those with a category field.
- `count_dead_resources(directory)`: Identifies and counts resources with minimal content.
- Provides detailed counts for each resource type.
- Handles sub-references in Location resources.

Both scripts use similar dependencies (os, json, sys) and include error handling for incorrect command-line usage and JSON parsing issues.

## Dependencies
Both scripts rely on standard Python libraries:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| os | File system operations | Standard library |
| json | JSON parsing | Standard library |
| sys | Command-line argument handling | Standard library |
| base64 | Decoding base64-encoded strings (in complex_dead_resource_counter.py) | Standard library |

These standard libraries were chosen for their reliability, performance, and built-in availability in Python environments, eliminating the need for external dependencies.

## Configuration
Both scripts are designed to be run from the command line and require a directory path as an argument. For example:

```bash
python complex_dead_resource_counter.py /path/to/fhir/data
python dead_resource_counter.py /path/to/fhir/data
```

No additional configuration files or environment variables are required. The scripts are configured through their internal logic to look for specific patterns and resource types within the FHIR JSON files.

In summary, these scripts provide powerful tools for analyzing FHIR data quality, focusing on identifying incomplete or problematic resources. They offer valuable insights for healthcare data professionals working with FHIR-based systems, helping to improve data integrity and completeness.
