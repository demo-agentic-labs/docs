## High-level description
This code is part of a utility for converting C-CDA XML files to FHIR format and generating a Medical Record (MR) summary. It processes XML files, converts them to FHIR JSON, consolidates the resources, generates an HTML summary, and provides statistics on the conversion process.

## Code Structure
The main function `main()` orchestrates the conversion process. It uses helper functions from imported modules to read files, convert them, and process the results. The code interacts with a FHIR converter API, handles file operations, and generates various outputs including JSON files and HTML summaries.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the entire conversion and summary generation process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the environment and initializes variables.
2. Reads XML files from the specified folder.
3. Converts XML files to FHIR format using the `convertCDAsToFHIR` function.
4. Consolidates all FHIR resources into a single bundle.
5. Generates an HTML summary of the Medical Record.
6. Counts and reports on the resources in the converted files.
7. Stores statistics and logs.

### `getResourcesPerDirectory(dirName: string, fileExtension = ".json")`
#### Description
Retrieves FHIR resources from JSON files in a specified directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dirName | string | The directory to search for files |
| fileExtension | string | The file extension to look for (default: ".json") |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resources | BundleEntry&lt;Resource&gt;[] | An array of FHIR resource entries |

#### Internal Logic
1. Searches for files with the specified extension in the given directory.
2. Reads the contents of each file.
3. Extracts and returns the FHIR resources from the files.

### `getResources(fileName: string)`
#### Description
Extracts FHIR resources from a single file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fileName | string | The name of the file to read |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resources | BundleEntry&lt;Resource&gt;[] | An array of FHIR resource entries from the file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the contents of the specified file.
2. Parses the JSON content.
3. Extracts and returns the FHIR resources from the parsed content.

### `storeStats(stats: any)`
#### Description
Stores the conversion statistics in a JSON file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stats | any | The statistics object to store |

#### Internal Logic
Writes the provided statistics object to a JSON file in the logs folder.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Loading environment variables |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | FHIR type definitions |
| @metriport/core | Core functionality for FHIR conversion |
| @metriport/shared | Shared utilities |
| axios | Making HTTP requests |
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation |
| fs | File system operations |
| path | File path manipulation |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, particularly in the `convertCDAsToFHIR` function. It catches and logs errors during the conversion process, storing error information in separate files.

## Logging
The code uses console.log for logging various steps and results of the conversion process. It also stores logs and statistics in files within a designated logs folder.

## TODOs
- There is a TODO comment suggesting moving some logic to a shared file to avoid duplication with the SQS to converter lambda.

This code is part of a larger system for processing medical records and converting them to FHIR format. It's designed to handle batch processing of XML files and provide comprehensive output including converted FHIR resources and summary reports.
