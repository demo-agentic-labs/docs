## High-level description
This code is a script that analyzes FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) bundles stored in JSON files. It counts the number of resources and references within these bundles, including missing references, and provides a summary of the analysis. The script is designed to process multiple files in a specified folder and can be run with a verbose option for more detailed output.

## Code Structure
The main function `main()` orchestrates the overall execution of the script. It uses helper functions like `executeForFile()` and `getResources()` to process individual files and extract resources. The script also utilizes external functions from imported modules for specific tasks such as getting references from resources and file operations.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the execution of the script. It processes all JSON files in a specified folder, excluding those with "error" in their name.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the folder name
2. Gets a list of JSON files in the specified folder
3. Processes each file using `executeForFile()`
4. Calculates and logs summary statistics

### `executeForFile(fileName: string, verbose: boolean)`
#### Description
Processes a single JSON file, extracting resources and references, and updating global counters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fileName | string | The name of the file to process |
| verbose | boolean | Whether to log detailed information about missing references |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts resources from the file
2. Gets references and missing references from the resources
3. Updates global counters
4. Logs summary information for the file
5. If verbose, logs detailed information about missing references

### `getResources(fileName: string)`
#### Description
Reads a JSON file and extracts FHIR resources from it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fileName | string | The name of the file to read |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resources | Resource[] | Array of FHIR resources extracted from the file |
| raw | string | Raw contents of the file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the file contents
2. Parses the JSON content
3. Extracts and returns the resources from the FHIR bundle

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | For loading environment variables |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | For FHIR type definitions |
| @metriport/core/external/fhir/shared/bundle | For getting references from resources |
| @metriport/shared | For utility functions like sleep and number formatting |
| commander | For parsing command-line arguments |
| dayjs | For date and duration calculations |
| lodash | For utility functions like uniqBy |
| ../shared/fs | For file system operations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| folderName | string | "" | The folder containing JSON files to process |
| referencesToInclude | ResourceType[] | [] | Types of references to include in the analysis |
| verbose | boolean | undefined | Whether to log detailed information about missing references |

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling, such as checking for a valid folder name and handling invalid bundles. It uses console.log for error reporting.

## Performance Considerations
The script processes files sequentially, which may not be optimal for large numbers of files. Consider implementing parallel processing for improved performance with large datasets.
