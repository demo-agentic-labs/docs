## High-level description
This code is a script that handles the post-processing of an uploaded document. It uses environment variables to configure the source and destination buckets, AWS region, and API URL. The main functionality is to call the `documentUploaderHandler` function from the `@metriport/core` package to process the uploaded file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | To load environment variables from a .env file |
| @metriport/core | To use the `documentUploaderHandler` function |

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is an asynchronous function that serves as the entry point for the script. It calls the `documentUploaderHandler` function with the necessary parameters and handles any errors that may occur during the process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the API server URL by appending "/internal/docs/doc-ref" to the base API URL.
2. Calls the `documentUploaderHandler` function with the following parameters:
   - sourceBucket
   - sourceKey
   - destinationBucket
   - region
   - apiServerURL
3. Logs a success message if the operation completes without errors.
4. Catches and logs any errors that occur during the process.

## Configuration
The script uses several environment variables for configuration:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| SOURCE_BUCKET | string | The source S3 bucket name |
| SOURCE_KEY | string | The key of the source file in the S3 bucket |
| DESTINATION_BUCKET | string | The destination S3 bucket name |
| AWS_REGION | string | The AWS region where the S3 buckets are located |
| API_URL | string | The base URL of the API server |

## Error Handling
The script uses a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the `documentUploaderHandler` function. If an error occurs, it is logged to the console.

## References
The script references the `documentUploaderHandler` function from the `@metriport/core/external/aws/lambda-logic/document-uploader` module. This function is responsible for the actual processing of the uploaded document.

Based on the related code snippet provided, the `documentUploaderHandler` function performs the following tasks:
1. Parses the S3 file key to extract customer ID, patient ID, and document ID.
2. Retrieves file information from the source S3 bucket.
3. Copies the file from the source bucket to the destination bucket.
4. Prepares file data and forwards it to the API server.
5. Creates and uploads a document metadata file.
6. Handles file size limitations.

The script in the target file serves as a wrapper to execute this handler function with the necessary parameters derived from environment variables.
