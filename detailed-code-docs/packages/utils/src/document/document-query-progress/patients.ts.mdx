## Symbols

### `patientsToCreate`
#### Description
An array of `PatientCreate` objects representing fictional patients for document queries. Each object contains basic patient information including name, date of birth, gender, and address.

#### Inputs
This is a constant, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientsToCreate | PatientCreate[] | An array of patient objects |

#### Internal Logic
The array contains 9 `PatientCreate` objects, each representing a different fictional character from popular superhero franchises (DC Comics and Marvel). Each object follows the same structure:

1. `firstName`: String representing the character's first name
2. `lastName`: String representing the character's last name
3. `dob`: String representing the character's date of birth in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
4. `genderAtBirth`: String representing the character's gender at birth ("M" for male, "F" for female)
5. `address`: Object containing address information:
   - `addressLine1`: String with a generic street address
   - `city`: String with the character's associated city
   - `state`: Always set to `USState.NY` (New York)
   - `zip`: String with a generic ZIP code "12345"
   - `country`: String set to "USA"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Provides the `PatientCreate` type used for defining patient objects |
| @metriport/shared | Provides the `USState` enum used for specifying the state in addresses |

## Notes
1. All patients are set to reside in New York (NY) state, regardless of their fictional origins.
2. The address information is generic, using "123 Test Ave" for all patients and a placeholder ZIP code.
3. The dates of birth correspond to the characters' first appearance in comics or other media, not their in-universe birth dates.
4. The list includes characters from both DC Comics (e.g., Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent) and Marvel Comics (e.g., Tony Stark, Steve Rogers), providing a diverse set of test data.

This file appears to be used for testing or demonstration purposes, providing a consistent set of patient data that can be used across different parts of the application or for running document queries.
