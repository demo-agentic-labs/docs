## References
The types defined in this file are referenced in the related file `cq-org-builder.ts`. Specifically:

1. The `Gateway` type is used to type the `originalPayloadFromCW` variable, which is imported from a JSON file.
2. The `Org` type is indirectly used when mapping over `gateway.Organizations` in the `cq-org-builder.ts` file.

These types serve as the foundation for processing and structuring data related to CommonWell organizations and gateways in the larger application context, particularly in the organization building and hydration process implemented in `cq-org-builder.ts`.
