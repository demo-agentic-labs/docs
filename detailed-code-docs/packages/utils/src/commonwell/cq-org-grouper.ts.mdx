## High-level description
This script processes and organizes CommonWell Health Alliance (CW) organizations and gateways data. It generates two CSV files: one for organizations and another for gateways, with relevant information sorted and formatted for external processing.

## Code Structure
The main function `main()` orchestrates the entire process, calling helper functions to initialize CSV files, fetch organization data, and write the sorted information to the respective CSV files.

## Symbols

### `initCSVs()`
#### Description
Initializes two CSV files with their respective headers.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates or overwrites `cq-orgs.csv` with the header for organization data.
- Creates or overwrites `cq-orgs-by-gateway.csv` with the header for gateway data.

### `toStr(v: string)`
#### Description
Sanitizes string input for CSV formatting.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| v | string | Input string to be sanitized |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | Sanitized string with trimmed whitespace and tabs replaced by spaces |

### `main()`
#### Description
The main function that executes the entire process of fetching, processing, and writing organization and gateway data to CSV files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the start time of the process.
2. Initializes CSV files by calling `initCSVs()`.
3. Fetches organization data using `getOrgs()` from an external module.
4. Loads gateway data from a JSON file (`originalPayloadFromCW`).
5. Processes and writes gateway data to the gateway CSV file, sorted by the number of organizations in descending order.
6. Processes and writes organization data to the organization CSV file, sorted by organization name in ascending order.
7. Logs the completion of the process and file locations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Load environment variables from a .env file |
| @metriport/core/external/commonwell/cq-bridge/get-orgs | Fetch organization data |
| fs | File system operations for writing CSV files |
| lodash | Utility functions, specifically `orderBy` for sorting |

## Configuration
The script uses environment variables loaded by `dotenv`, but specific variables are not explicitly mentioned in the code.

## Performance Considerations
The script processes potentially large datasets of organizations and gateways. The use of `orderBy` from lodash for sorting may impact performance for very large datasets.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for file operations and data fetching.
- Evaluate the need for streaming writes for larger datasets to improve memory usage.
- Add command-line arguments for customizing output file names or locations.
