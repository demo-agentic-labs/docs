## High-level description
This directory contains utility scripts and types for interacting with the CommonWell Health Alliance network. It includes tools for managing sessions, enhancing coverage, building and grouping organization lists, and performing coverage assessments. The code is designed to work with the CommonWell API and related services, providing functionality for both local development and cloud-based operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key functions related to CommonWell Health Alliance:

1. Session Management: Maintains active sessions with CommonWell, handling authentication, cookie management, and code challenges.

2. Coverage Enhancement: Updates patient information and queries documents to improve data coverage within the CommonWell network.

3. Organization List Management: Processes and organizes CommonWell organizations and gateways, including prioritization and state information hydration.

4. Coverage Assessment: Evaluates coverage for a subset of patients, optionally downloading documents and generating reports.

5. Code Challenge Handling: Manages code challenges required for authentication, supporting both local and cloud-based implementations.

These utilities help healthcare providers and organizations interact with the CommonWell network more effectively, manage patient data, and assess the availability of health information across the network.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `session-manager.ts`: Manages CommonWell sessions, handling authentication and cookie management.
2. `enhance-coverage.ts`: Orchestrates the process of enhancing coverage for patients in the CommonWell network.
3. `coverage-assessment.ts`: Performs coverage assessments for patients, generating detailed reports.
4. `cq-org-builder.ts`: Builds and updates the list of CommonWell organizations with additional metadata.
5. `cq-org-grouper.ts`: Organizes CommonWell organizations and gateways into structured CSV files.

These scripts can be run independently to perform their respective tasks. They interact with various CommonWell APIs and services, as well as with AWS services for cloud-based operations.

## Key Files
1. `cq-org-types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types for CommonWell organizations and gateways.
2. `cq-org-list-by-prio.ts`: Contains prioritized lists of CommonWell organization OIDs.
3. `code-challenge-secret-manager.ts`: Implements code challenge retrieval from AWS Secrets Manager.

These files provide essential types, data structures, and utilities used across the other scripts in the directory.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. @metriport/core and @metriport/shared: Custom packages providing core functionality and shared utilities.
2. @metriport/commonwell-sdk: SDK for interacting with the CommonWell API.
3. dotenv: For loading environment variables.
4. axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
5. playwright: Browser automation tool used for session management.
6. lodash: Utility library for various operations.
7. dayjs: Date manipulation library.
8. commander: Command-line argument parsing.
9. AWS SDK: For interacting with AWS services like Secrets Manager.

These dependencies are chosen to provide robust functionality for API interactions, data processing, and cloud integration.

## Configuration
The scripts in this directory use various environment variables for configuration, including:

- API URLs and credentials for CommonWell
- AWS region and secret ARNs
- Sequoia API key
- Organization certificate folder paths
- Customer IDs and other operational parameters

Configuration is typically loaded using dotenv, allowing for easy management of environment-specific settings.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with the CommonWell Health Alliance network, enabling efficient management of patient data, organization information, and network interactions. The code is designed to be flexible, supporting both local development and cloud-based deployments, and can be extended or modified to meet specific integration needs.
