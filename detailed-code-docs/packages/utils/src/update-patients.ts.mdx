## High-level description
This code is a utility script designed to trigger patient updates for specified customer IDs (cxIds) through an internal API endpoint. It uses environment variables for configuration and implements a delay between each API call to prevent overwhelming the server.

## Code Structure
The script imports necessary dependencies, sets up configuration, and defines a main function that iterates through customer IDs, making API calls for each one with a specified delay between calls.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the script. It iterates through a list of customer IDs, making a POST request to trigger a patient update for each ID, with a delay between requests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the API URL by combining the base URL with the endpoint path.
2. Iterates through the list of customer IDs (`cxIds`).
3. For each customer ID:
   - Makes a POST request to the API endpoint with the customer ID as a query parameter.
   - Waits for a specified duration before processing the next customer ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Loads environment variables from a .env file |
| @metriport/shared | Provides the `sleep` utility function |
| axios | Makes HTTP requests to the API |
| @metriport/core/util/env-var | Retrieves environment variables |
| dayjs | Handles date and time operations |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_URL | string | N/A | The base URL for the API, retrieved from environment variables |
| SLEEP_TIME_BETWEEN_CX | Duration | 1 second | The delay between API calls for different customer IDs |

## Performance Considerations
The script implements a delay between API calls to prevent overwhelming the server with rapid requests. This is particularly important when dealing with a large number of customer IDs.

## TODOs
The `cxIds` array is currently empty (`[""]`). This should be populated with actual customer IDs before running the script.

## Notes
1. The script uses `dotenv.config()` at the top to ensure environment variables are loaded before any other imports.
2. The `getEnvVarOrFail` function is used to retrieve the API_URL, which will throw an error if the environment variable is not set.
3. The script is designed to be run as a standalone utility and not as part of a larger application.
4. Error handling for API calls is not implemented in this script. Consider adding try-catch blocks or error handling logic for production use.
