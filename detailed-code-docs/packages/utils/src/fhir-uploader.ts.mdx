## High-level description
This code implements a command-line interface (CLI) tool called "fhir-uploader" that uploads synthetic data from Synthea into a FHIR server. It reads JSON files from a specified folder and posts them to a FHIR server using HTTP requests.

## Code Structure
The main functionality is implemented in the `main` function, which is called at the end of the file. The CLI is set up using the Commander library, and HTTP requests are made using Axios.

## Symbols

### `program`
#### Description
This symbol represents the Command object from the Commander library, used to set up the CLI interface.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the name and description of the CLI tool
- Defines required and optional command-line options
- Adds custom help text with ASCII art
- Sets the version number

### `main`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is the entry point of the script, handling the file reading and uploading process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up Axios defaults and headers for FHIR server communication
2. Reads JSON files from the specified folder
3. Iterates through each file:
   - Reads and parses the file contents
   - Posts the data to the FHIR server
   - Logs the response status and time taken
4. Logs the total number of files processed and total time taken

#### Performance Considerations
The function processes files sequentially, which may not be optimal for large numbers of files. Consider implementing parallel processing for improved performance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| axios | Making HTTP requests to the FHIR server |
| commander | Creating the command-line interface |
| fs | Reading files from the local filesystem |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| --folder | string | (required) | Absolute path to the folder containing the Synthea files |
| --server | string | (required) | Address of the FHIR server |
| --path | string | "/" | The URI/path within the server to post data to |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on default error handling from Axios and Node.js.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` for basic logging of progress and results.

## TODOs
- Implement error handling for file reading and HTTP request errors
- Consider adding support for authentication with the FHIR server
- Optimize performance for large numbers of files by implementing parallel processing
