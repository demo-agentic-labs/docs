title: "query-to-s3.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code exports the contents of a SQL query to an Amazon S3 bucket as a JSON file. It's designed to query a specific table, filtering records based on their creation date, and then upload the results to S3. The script is configurable through environment variables and includes memory usage logging.

## Code Structure
The main functionality is encapsulated in the `main()` function, which orchestrates the database query and S3 upload process. Helper functions like `getMemoryUsage()` and `logMemoryUsage()` are used for monitoring memory consumption throughout the execution.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is the entry point of the script. It performs the database query, uploads the results to S3, and logs the process details and memory usage.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the database connection using Sequelize.
2. Executes the SQL query to retrieve records.
3. Uploads the query results to S3 as a JSON file.
4. Logs memory usage and execution time.
5. Exits the process explicitly to prevent hanging.

### `getMemoryUsage()`
#### Description
Returns an object containing formatted strings representing various memory usage metrics.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rss | string | Resident Set Size in MB |
| heapTotal | string | Total size of the allocated heap in MB |
| heapUsed | string | Actual memory used during execution in MB |
| external | string | Memory used by C++ objects bound to JavaScript objects in MB |

### `logMemoryUsage()`
#### Description
Logs the current memory usage by calling `getMemoryUsage()` and printing the result to the console.

### `getFileName()`
#### Description
Generates a filename for the S3 upload based on the table name, date range, and current timestamp.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fileName | string | Generated filename for S3 upload |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Load environment variables from a .env file |
| @metriport/core/util/env-var | Retrieve environment variables |
| @metriport/shared/common/date | Date formatting constants |
| aws-sdk | Interact with AWS services (S3) |
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation |
| sequelize | ORM for database operations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DB_CREDS | string | N/A | JSON string containing database credentials |
| S3_BUCKET_NAME | string | N/A | Name of the S3 bucket for file upload |
| AWS_REGION | string | N/A | AWS region for S3 operations |
| daysToKeep | number | 999 | Number of days of data to retain |
| tableName | string | "&lt;TABLE&gt;" | Name of the database table to query |

## Performance Considerations
The script includes memory usage logging, which can be useful for monitoring performance and identifying potential memory leaks. The use of Sequelize for database operations and the AWS SDK for S3 uploads may have performance implications for large datasets.

## TODOs
- Update `tableName` and `daysToKeep` to match specific needs.
- Consider implementing error handling for database connection, query execution, and S3 upload.
- Evaluate the need for the explicit `process.exit(0)` call and consider alternative ways to handle script completion.
