title: "peek-dlq.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file, `peek-dlq.ts`, is intended to provide functionality for peeking into an SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) without removing messages. However, the actual implementation is currently commented out, and the file suggests considering a more mature solution like `sqsPeek`.

## Code Structure
The file currently exports an empty object as default. The commented-out code defines types and functions for interacting with an SQS DLQ, including retrieving message counts and generating download links for associated S3 files.

## Symbols

### Default export
#### Description
The file exports an empty object as the default export.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
An empty object

## TODOs
The code includes a TODO comment suggesting to consider using a more mature and tested solution like `https://github.com/yashLadha/sqsPeek` or another similar library for peeking into SQS queues.

## Commented-out Code
The file contains a significant amount of commented-out code that appears to implement the following functionality:

1. Defining a `ConversionDLQMessageType` type for messages in the DLQ.
2. Implementing a `peekIntoQueue` function that:
   - Retrieves the message count from the queue
   - Peeks at up to 10 messages from the queue
   - Parses the message bodies and attributes
   - Generates signed URLs for downloading associated S3 files
   - Returns the message count and details of up to 10 messages

This commented-out code suggests that the file was intended to provide functionality for inspecting messages in a Dead Letter Queue related to a file conversion process, likely for healthcare data (given the presence of `patientId` and `cxId` fields).

## Dependencies
The commented-out code references several undefined functions and constants, suggesting dependencies on other modules:

- `Config.getSidechainFHIRConverterDQLURL()`
- `BadRequestError`
- `getMessageCountFromQueue`
- `peekMessagesFromQueue`
- `getSignedUrl`

## Error Handling
The commented-out code includes basic error handling, throwing a `BadRequestError` if the DLQ URL is missing.

In conclusion, while the file currently exports an empty object, it contains commented-out code that suggests a more complex implementation for peeking into an SQS Dead Letter Queue. The TODO comment indicates that the developers are considering using a more established library for this functionality instead of implementing it themselves.
