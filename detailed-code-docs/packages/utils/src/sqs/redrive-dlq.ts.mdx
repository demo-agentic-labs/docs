## High-level description
This file contains code for redriving messages from a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) to a regular SQS queue, with the ability to process and deduplicate messages before redriving. However, the main functionality is currently commented out, and the file only exports an empty object.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main functions: `redriveDLQ` and `redriveSQSUnique`, both of which are currently commented out. These functions work together to retrieve messages from a source queue, deduplicate them, and send them to a destination queue.

## Symbols

### `redriveDLQ` (commented out)
#### Description
This function is designed to retrieve all messages from a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), deduplicate them, and send the unique messages to a regular queue for re-processing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| maxNumberOfMessages | number | The maximum number of messages to process |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | \{ originalCount: number, uniqueCount: number \} | An object containing the original message count and the count of unique messages |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the DLQ and regular queue URLs are available
2. Calls `redriveSQSUnique` with the appropriate parameters, including a custom content comparator function

### `redriveSQSUnique` (commented out)
#### Description
This function retrieves messages from a source queue, deduplicates them, and sends the unique messages to a destination queue.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sourceQueueUrl | string | The URL of the source SQS queue |
| destinationQueueUrl | string | The URL of the destination SQS queue |
| maxNumberOfMessages | number | The maximum number of messages to process |
| contentComparator | function (optional) | A function to compare message contents for deduplication |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | \{ originalCount: number, uniqueCount: number \} | An object containing the original message count and the count of unique messages |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates the actual maximum number of messages to process
2. Retrieves the message count from the source queue
3. Fetches messages from the source queue in parallel
4. Deduplicates the messages using the provided content comparator
5. Sends the unique messages to the destination queue
6. Returns the original and unique message counts

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-sdk | For interacting with AWS SQS |
| lodash | For utility functions like `uniq` and `uniqBy` |
| @metriport/core/util/uuid-v7 | For generating UUIDs |

## TODOs
- Consider exposing the `redriveSQSUnique` function to a shared library in core, along with Lambda's SQSUtils

## Notes
The code is currently commented out, with only an empty object being exported. The comment at the top suggests that this code should only be built if there's a need to process messages before redriving them. Otherwise, it recommends using the `sqsmover` tool (https://github.com/mercury2269/sqsmover) for simple redriving.
