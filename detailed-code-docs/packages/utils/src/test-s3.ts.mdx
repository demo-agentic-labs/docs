## High-level description
This code is a utility script for testing S3 file uploads. It demonstrates how to upload a file to an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for JavaScript, with the file path structured according to a specific pattern involving customer and patient IDs.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is an asynchronous function that performs the S3 upload test. It retrieves necessary configuration from environment variables, sets up the AWS S3 client, and uploads a test file to the specified S3 bucket.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieve the AWS region and S3 bucket name from environment variables.
2. Define test data: customer ID, patient ID, and file name.
3. Initialize the AWS S3 client with the specified region.
4. Upload a test file to S3 with a key (path) structured as `${cxId}/${patientId}/${cxId}_${patientId}_${fileName}`.
5. Log the upload result.

#### Side Effects
- Logs messages to the console.
- Uploads a file to an S3 bucket.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Load environment variables from a .env file |
| @metriport/core/util/env-var | Retrieve environment variables |
| aws-sdk | Interact with AWS services, specifically S3 |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REGION | string | N/A | AWS region for S3 operations |
| S3_BUCKET_NAME | string | N/A | Name of the S3 bucket for file upload |

## Error Handling
The script uses `getEnvVarOrFail` to retrieve environment variables, which likely throws an error if the required variables are not set. However, there's no explicit error handling for the S3 upload operation.

## Logging
The script uses `console.log` to output information about the upload process and results.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for the S3 upload operation.
- The hardcoded test data (cxId, patientId, fileName) could be moved to environment variables or command-line arguments for more flexible testing.
- The file content ("contents of test file") is hardcoded. Consider reading from an actual file or allowing custom content input.
