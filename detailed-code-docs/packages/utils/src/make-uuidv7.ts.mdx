title: "make-uuidv7.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a simple function that generates and logs a UUID version 7 (UUIDv7) to the console. It imports the `uuidv7` function from a shared module and uses it to create a unique identifier.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
The `main` function is an asynchronous function that generates a UUIDv7 using the imported `uuidv7` function and logs it to the console.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value, but it produces a side effect by logging the generated UUID to the console.

#### Internal Logic
1. Call the imported `uuidv7()` function to generate a new UUIDv7.
2. Log the generated UUID to the console using `console.log()`.

## Side Effects
The main side effect of this code is logging output to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `./shared/uuid-v7` | Provides the `uuidv7` function for generating UUIDv7 identifiers |

## References
This code references the `uuidv7` function from the `./shared/uuid-v7` module. The implementation of this function is provided in the related code snippet.

## Additional Notes
1. The `main()` function is defined as asynchronous (`async`), but it doesn't use any `await` statements. This suggests that the asynchronous nature might be unnecessary for the current implementation.

2. The `main()` function is called immediately after its definition, which means this script will execute and log a UUIDv7 as soon as it's run.

3. The related `uuid-v7.ts` file contains a comprehensive implementation of UUID generation, including UUIDv7 and UUIDv4. It provides more functionality than what's being used in this simple script, such as object-oriented UUID representation, parsing, and comparison.

4. The UUIDv7 generation in the related file is designed to be monotonic and handles timestamp rollbacks, which is particularly useful for distributed systems where clock synchronization might be an issue.

5. While this script only uses the `uuidv7()` function, the related file also provides `uuidv7obj()`, `uuidv4()`, and `uuidv4obj()` functions for different UUID generation needs.
