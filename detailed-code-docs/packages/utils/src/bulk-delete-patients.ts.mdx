## High-level description
This code is a utility script for bulk deleting patients from both Metriport and CommonWell (CW) systems. It also deletes the corresponding person in CW if the person was created by the customer (CX). The script is designed to handle cases where patients were registered with incorrect demographics.

## Code Structure
The main function `main()` orchestrates the deletion process. It uses helper functions like `getCxData()`, `buildCWPatientId()`, and `getPersonId()` to retrieve necessary data and perform operations. The script interacts with both Metriport's internal API and the CommonWell API to delete patients and their associated records.

### `main()`

The main function that orchestrates the bulk deletion of patients.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves customer data using `getCxData()`.
2. Initializes the CommonWell API client.

   - Searches for the corresponding person in CommonWell.
   - If the person was created by the customer's organization, deletes the person from CommonWell.
