## High-level description
This script triggers the generation of consolidated medical records for a list of patients using the Metriport API. It allows for customization of date ranges, resources to include, and conversion type, while handling authentication and rate limiting between requests.

## Code Structure
The script imports necessary dependencies, sets up configuration variables, and defines the main function that iterates through patient IDs to make API requests for consolidated medical records.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the process of triggering consolidated medical record generation for a list of patients.

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the start of the process with customer ID and number of patients.
2. Iterates through the list of patient IDs.
3. For each patient, makes an API call to trigger the consolidated record generation.
4. Implements a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the API.
5. Logs the progress and timing information.

### Configuration Variables
#### Description
Several configuration variables are defined at the top of the file to customize the script's behavior.

| Variable | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| patientIds | string[] | List of patient IDs to process |
| fromDate | string \| undefined | Start date for the date range (inclusive) |
| toDate | string \| undefined | End date for the date range (inclusive) |
| resources | string[] \| undefined | List of resources to include in the consolidated record |
| conversionType | string | Type of conversion for the consolidated record (set to "pdf") |
| cxId | string | Customer ID retrieved from environment variables |
| apiUrl | string | API URL retrieved from environment variables |
| timeBetweenPatients | number | Delay between API calls in milliseconds |

### `axiosConfig`
#### Description
Configuration object for Axios HTTP client.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets a timeout of 120 seconds for requests
- Uses the `apiUrl` as the base URL for requests
- Includes an `x-api-key` header with the encoded customer ID for authentication

### `api`
#### Description
Axios instance created with the `axiosConfig` for making API requests.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Load environment variables from a .env file |
| @metriport/core/util/env-var | Retrieve environment variables |
| @metriport/shared | Utility functions (sleep, formatNumber) |
| axios | HTTP client for making API requests |
| base64url | Encode customer ID for authentication |
| dayjs | Date manipulation and formatting |

## Error Handling
The script does not implement explicit error handling. Errors from API calls or other operations will cause the script to terminate.

## Logging
The script uses console.log for logging progress, including:
- Start of the process with customer ID and number of patients
- Progress for each patient request
- Total execution time at the end of the process

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for API calls and other potential failure points.
- Implement a mechanism to resume the process from where it left off in case of interruption.
- Add command-line arguments or a configuration file for easier customization of script parameters.
