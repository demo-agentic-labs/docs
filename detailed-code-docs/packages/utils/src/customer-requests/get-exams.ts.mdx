## High-level description
This code implements a utility for executing asynchronous operations on a collection of items in parallel, with configurable concurrency, delay, and error handling. It's designed to process large datasets efficiently by distributing the workload across multiple concurrent executions.

## Code Structure
The main function `executeAsynchronously` orchestrates the parallel execution of tasks. It uses helper functions and types to manage the execution flow, handle errors, and provide logging capabilities.

## Symbols

### `executeAsynchronously&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
This function processes an array of items asynchronously, allowing for parallel execution with configurable options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| collection | T[] | Array of elements to be processed |
| fn | FunctionType&lt;T&gt; | Function to be executed asynchronously for each item |
| options | ExecuteInChunksOptions | Optional settings for execution |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;PromiseSettledResult&lt;void&gt;[]&gt; | Array of promise results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates input parameters
2. Copies the input collection
3. Calculates the number of parallel promises to run
4. Creates an array of promises, each processing a subset of items
5. Executes the promises in parallel
6. Returns the results of all promises

### `executeSynchronously&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
A helper function that processes items sequentially within each parallel execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| itemsToProcess | T[] | Array of items to process |
| fn | FunctionType&lt;T&gt; | Function to execute for each item |
| promiseIndex | number | Index of the current promise |
| amountOfPromises | number | Total number of parallel promises |
| indexControl | \{ currentIndex: number \} | Shared object to track overall progress |
| keepExecutingOnError | boolean | Whether to continue execution on error |
| log | function (optional) | Logging function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the items
2. Executes the provided function for each item
3. Handles errors based on the `keepExecutingOnError` flag
4. Updates the shared index control
5. Logs progress if a logging function is provided

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| errorToString | Converts errors to string format |
| sleep | Introduces delays between executions |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling through the `keepExecutingOnError` option. If set to `true`, errors in individual item processing won't stop the overall execution. Otherwise, an error will halt the entire process.

## Performance Considerations
- The function allows for parallel execution, which can significantly improve performance for I/O-bound tasks.
- The `numberOfParallelExecutions` option allows fine-tuning of concurrency based on system capabilities and task nature.
- Jitter and delay options can help prevent overwhelming external systems when making API calls.

This utility is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to process a large number of items efficiently, such as batch API calls, data processing, or any task that can benefit from parallel execution with controlled concurrency.
