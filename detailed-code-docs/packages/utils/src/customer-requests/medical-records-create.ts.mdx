## High-level description
This code is a utility script for generating and downloading Medical Records (MRs) as PDFs for a subset of a customer's patients. It creates a new folder, retrieves consolidated patient data as PDFs, and stores them in the designated folder.

## Code Structure
The main function orchestrates the process, calling helper functions to get medical record URLs and download files. It uses environment variables for configuration and external APIs for data retrieval.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the process of generating and downloading medical records for the specified patients.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the runs folder
2. Retrieves customer data
3. Creates a directory for storing the medical records
4. Iterates through the list of patient IDs:
   - Generates a medical record URL for each patient
   - Downloads the medical record file
5. Logs the total duration of the process

### `getMedicalRecordURL(patientId: string)`
#### Description
Retrieves the URL for a patient's medical record PDF.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string \| undefined | The URL of the medical record PDF, if available |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the API endpoint URL with query parameters
2. Makes a GET request to the API
3. Extracts the medical record URL from the response

### `downloadFile(url: string, patientId: string, dirName: string)`
#### Description
Downloads a file from the given URL and saves it to the specified directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL of the file to download |
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient (used for naming the file) |
| dirName | string | The directory to save the file in |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;string&gt; | A promise that resolves to "success" when the download is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a write stream for the file
2. Makes an HTTPS GET request to the URL
3. Pipes the response to the write stream
4. Resolves the promise when the file is fully written

| dotenv | Loading environment variables |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Type definitions for FHIR resources |
| @metriport/core/util/env-var | Utility for getting environment variables |
| @metriport/shared/common/error | Error handling utility |
| @metriport/shared/common/numbers | Number formatting utility |
| axios | Making HTTP requests |
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation |
| fs | File system operations |
| https | HTTPS requests for file downloads |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_URL | string | N/A | The base URL for the API |
| CX_ID | string | N/A | The customer ID |

## Error Handling
The script uses try-catch blocks to handle errors during the medical record generation and download process. Errors are logged with patient IDs for easier debugging.

## Logging
The script uses console.log for logging progress, errors, and timing information throughout the process.

## TODOs
- The `patientIds` array is empty in the provided code. It should be populated with the desired patient IDs before running the script.
