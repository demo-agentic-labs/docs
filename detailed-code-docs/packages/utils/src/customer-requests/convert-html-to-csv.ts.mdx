## High-level description
This code defines a function `convertHtmlTablesToCsv` that takes an HTML string as input and converts it into a CSV format. It specifically targets HTML tables within sections, extracts the data, and structures it into a CSV format, including patient information from a header table.

## Symbols

### `convertHtmlTablesToCsv`
#### Description
This function converts HTML tables to CSV format. It parses the HTML, extracts data from tables within sections, and formats it into CSV, including patient information from a header table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| html | string | The input HTML string containing tables to be converted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| convertedCsv | string | The resulting CSV string containing the extracted and formatted data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parse the HTML string using DOMParser.
2. Find all elements with class "section".
3. For each section:
   - Extract the section title.
   - Process tables within the section:
     - If there's one table, extract its data.
     - If there are multiple tables, process each table separately.
   - Format the extracted data into CSV strings.
4. Extract patient information from the header table.
5. Combine all extracted data into a single CSV string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| xmldom | Used for parsing HTML strings into DOM objects |

## TODOs
The code includes a comment indicating that this function is temporary and will need refactoring in the future:
```typescript
// This is temporary function that will eventually be introduced
// as another way to render patient data. (Will need refactoring)
```

## Performance Considerations
The function uses nested loops to iterate through DOM elements, which may impact performance for large HTML documents. Consider optimizing these loops or using more efficient DOM traversal methods for better performance in production environments.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. It might be beneficial to add try-catch blocks to handle potential errors during HTML parsing or data extraction.
