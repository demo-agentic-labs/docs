## High-level description
This code is a utility script for downloading specific files from an Amazon S3 bucket and storing them locally. It uses environment variables for configuration and AWS SDK for S3 operations.

## Code Structure
The main functionality is encapsulated in the `main()` function, which iterates through a list of file names, downloads each file from S3, and saves it locally.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the process of downloading files from S3 and saving them locally.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the output directory.
2. Initializes an S3 client.
3. Iterates through the list of file names to download.
4. For each file:
   - Retrieves the file from S3.
   - If the file body exists, saves its content to a local file.

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| outputFolderName | string | "" | The folder where downloaded files will be stored |
| inputFileNamesToDownload | string[] | [] | List of file names to download from S3 |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/external/aws/s3 | Provides the `makeS3Client` function for S3 operations |
| @metriport/core/util/env-var | Provides the `getEnvVarOrFail` function for retrieving environment variables |
| ../shared/fs | Provides file system utility functions |

## Error Handling
The code relies on the default error handling mechanisms of the AWS SDK and the imported utility functions. There's no explicit error handling implemented in this script.

## TODOs
- The `outputFolderName` and `inputFileNamesToDownload` variables are currently empty. These need to be populated with appropriate values before running the script.
- Consider adding error handling and logging for better robustness and debugging.
- The script might benefit from command-line arguments or configuration files instead of hardcoded values for flexibility.
