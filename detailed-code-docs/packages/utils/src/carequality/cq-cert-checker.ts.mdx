## High-level description
This code sets up an HTTPS server using Express.js and Node.js's built-in HTTPS module. It's designed to test a certificate issued by Carequality by creating a secure server that listens on port 3000.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary modules, reads SSL/TLS credentials from files, and creates an HTTPS server using Express.js.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the Express application, which will be used to handle HTTP requests.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | Express.Application | An Express application instance |

### `privateKey`
#### Description
Reads the private key from a file.

#### Inputs
None (file path is hardcoded)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| privateKey | string | The contents of the private key file |

### `certificateChain`
#### Description
Reads the certificate chain from a file.

#### Inputs
None (file path is hardcoded)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| certificateChain | string | The contents of the certificate chain file |

### `credentials`
#### Description
An object containing the private key and certificate chain for HTTPS server configuration.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credentials | object | An object with `key` and `cert` properties |

### HTTPS Server Creation
#### Description
Creates and starts an HTTPS server using the Express app and the SSL/TLS credentials.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credentials | object | SSL/TLS credentials |
| app | Express.Application | Express application instance |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an HTTPS server using the `https.createServer` method.
2. Configures the server with the provided credentials and Express app.
3. Starts the server listening on port 3000.
4. Logs a message to the console when the server starts successfully.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| express | Web application framework for Node.js |
| https | Node.js built-in module for creating HTTPS servers |
| fs | Node.js built-in module for file system operations |

## TODOs
- Replace `&lt;path_to_your_private_key&gt;` with the actual path to the private key file.
- Replace `&lt;path_to_your_chain&gt;` with the actual path to the certificate chain file.

## Notes
1. This script is specifically designed to test a certificate issued by Carequality.
2. The private key and certificate chain paths are hardcoded and need to be updated with actual file paths before running the script.
3. The server listens on port 3000 for HTTPS connections.
4. No routes or middleware are defined for the Express app in this code snippet.
5. The script can be run using `ts-node run-cert.ts` as mentioned in the comment.
6. Ensure that the necessary files (private key and certificate chain) are in place before running the script.
7. This setup is likely for testing purposes and may need additional security considerations for production use.
