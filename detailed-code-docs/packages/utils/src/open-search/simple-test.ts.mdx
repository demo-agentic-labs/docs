## High-level description
This code is a test script for performing simple operations on OpenSearch using the OpenSearch client library. It demonstrates how to create an index, add a document to the index, and then delete the index.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is an asynchronous function that serves as the entry point for the script. It performs a series of operations on OpenSearch, including checking if an index exists, creating the index if it doesn't exist, adding a document to the index, and finally deleting the index.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an OpenSearch client with the provided credentials and host.
2. Checks if the specified index exists.
3. If the index doesn't exist, creates it with a defined mapping.
4. Adds a sample document to the index.
5. Deletes the index.

#### Side Effects
- Creates, modifies, and deletes an OpenSearch index.
- Logs operations and results to the console.

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| username | string | "admin" | Username for OpenSearch authentication |
| password | string | "admin" | Password for OpenSearch authentication |
| host | string | "localhost:9200" | Host and port for OpenSearch server |
| indexName | string | "test" | Name of the index to be created and used |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @opensearch-project/opensearch | OpenSearch client library for Node.js |

## Error Handling
The script does not implement explicit error handling. Errors would be propagated and potentially cause the script to crash.

## Logging
The script uses `console.log` to output information about the operations being performed and their results.

## TODOs
- Implement proper error handling.
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive information like username and password.
- Add more robust testing scenarios, such as searching for documents or updating existing documents.
- Implement a cleanup mechanism to ensure the test index is always deleted, even if an error occurs during execution.
