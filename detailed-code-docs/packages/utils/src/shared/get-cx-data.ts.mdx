Here's the documentation for the target file `packages/utils/src/shared/get-cx-data.ts`:

## High-level description
This utility function `getCxData` retrieves customer data from an API endpoint using the provided customer ID. It returns essential information about the organization and facility associated with the customer.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `getCxData` function, which uses axios to make an API call and processes the response to return the required data.

## References
This code references the following external symbols:
- `Facility` and `Organization` from "@metriport/api-sdk"
- `getEnvVarOrFail` from "@metriport/core/util/env-var"
- `axios` for making HTTP requests

## Symbols

### `getCxData`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves customer data from an API endpoint and returns specific information about the organization and facility.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | The customer ID |
| facilityId | string \| undefined | Optional facility ID |
| includeFacility | boolean | Whether to include facility data (default: true) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | \{ facilityId: string \| undefined; npi: string \| undefined; orgName: string; orgOID: string; \} | An object containing the retrieved customer data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the start of the data retrieval process.
2. Makes a GET request to the API endpoint with the customer ID as a parameter.
3. Logs the retrieved customer data.
4. Extracts organization and facilities data from the response.
5. Validates the presence of organization and facilities data.
6. If `includeFacility` is true, it calls `getFacility()` to retrieve a specific facility or the only facility if there's just one.
7. Constructs and returns an object with the required data.

### `getFacility`
#### Description
An internal asynchronous function that retrieves a specific facility based on the provided facility ID or returns the only facility if there's just one.

#### Inputs
(No explicit inputs, uses closure variables)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| facility | Facility | The retrieved facility object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if facilities exist and throws an error if not.
2. If a facility ID is provided, it finds the matching facility.
3. If no facility ID is provided and there's more than one facility, it throws an error.
4. Returns the found facility or the only facility if there's just one.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | For loading environment variables |
| @metriport/api-sdk | For Facility and Organization types |
| @metriport/core/util/env-var | For retrieving environment variables |
| axios | For making HTTP requests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_URL | string | N/A | The URL of the API endpoint, retrieved from environment variables |

## Error Handling
The function throws errors in the following cases:
- If no organization is found in the API response
- If no facilities are found in the API response
- If no facility is found matching the provided ID
- If multiple facilities exist but no specific facility ID is provided

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `getCxData` function and its internal workings. It should help engineers and technical PMs understand the purpose, inputs, outputs, and behavior of this utility function.
