## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `initFile` that initializes a file with an optional header. It ensures the directory structure exists before creating the file, making it useful for setting up new files in potentially non-existent directories.

## Symbols

### `initFile`
#### Description
The `initFile` function creates a new file with an optional header. It first ensures that the directory path for the file exists, creating it if necessary, and then writes the header to the file if provided.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fileName | string | The path and name of the file to be created |
| header | string \| undefined | Optional content to be written at the beginning of the file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract the directory path from the given file name.
2. Check if the directory exists; if not, create it recursively.
3. If a header is provided, write it to the file.

## Side Effects
- Creates directories on the file system if they don't exist.
- Creates or overwrites a file on the file system.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fs | File system operations (checking existence, creating directories, writing files) |
| path | Handling file and directory paths |

## References
The `initFile` function is used in the related code snippet `packages/utils/src/coverage-assessment.ts`. It's utilized to initialize output files for a coverage assessment process:

```typescript
const outputFileName = getOutputFileName(orgName) + ".csv";
const errorFileName = getOutputFileName(orgName) + ".error";
initFile(outputFileName, csvHeader);
initFile(errorFileName);
```

This usage demonstrates how `initFile` is employed to set up both a CSV file (with a header) and an error log file at the beginning of a coverage assessment operation.
