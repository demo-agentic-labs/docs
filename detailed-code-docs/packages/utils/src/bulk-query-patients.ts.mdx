## High-level description
This script performs bulk document queries for patients of a specified customer in a healthcare-related application. It can query all patients or a specific set of patient IDs, with options for dry runs and webhook notifications. The script uses the Metriport API to fetch patient data and trigger document queries.

## Code Structure
The main function `main()` orchestrates the entire process, calling various helper functions to fetch patient IDs, display warnings, and execute document queries. The `queryDocsForPatient()` function handles the core logic of querying documents for individual patients.

## Symbols

### `main()`
#### Description
The main entry point of the script that orchestrates the entire bulk query process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the runs folder and parses command-line arguments.
2. Fetches customer data and patient IDs.
3. Displays a warning and confirmation message.
4. Initializes output files.
5. Processes patients in chunks, querying documents for each patient.
6. Logs progress and errors.

### `queryDocsForPatient()`
#### Description
Queries documents for a single patient and logs the results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient to query |
| outputFileName | string | The name of the file to write output |
| errorFileName | string | The name of the file to write errors |
| dryRun | boolean | Whether to perform a dry run |
| log | function | Logging function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches patient data and triggers a document query.
2. If not a dry run, processes the query results and counts FHIR resources.
3. Writes the results to the output file.
4. Handles and logs any errors.

### `displayWarningAndConfirmation()`
#### Description
Displays a warning message and waits for confirmation before proceeding with the bulk query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patientCount | number \| undefined | The number of patients to be queried |
| isAllPatients | boolean | Whether all patients are being queried |
| orgName | string | The name of the organization |
| dryRun | boolean | Whether it's a dry run |
| log | function | Logging function |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Loading environment variables |
| @metriport/api-sdk | Metriport API SDK for medical data |
| @metriport/core | Core utilities and domain logic |
| axios | HTTP client for making API requests |
| commander | Command-line interface parser |
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation library |
| fs | File system operations |
| lodash | Utility functions (chunk) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| CX_ID | string | N/A | Customer ID |
| API_KEY | string | N/A | API key for authentication |
| API_URL | string | N/A | Base URL for the API |
| PATIENT_CHUNK_SIZE | number | 10 | Number of patients to process in each chunk |
| PATIENT_CHUNK_DELAY_JITTER_MS | number | 1000 | Jitter delay between patient chunks |

## Error Handling
Errors are caught and logged to both the console and an error file. The script keeps track of patients with errors and continues processing other patients.

## Logging
The script uses a custom logging function that can be toggled for dry runs. It logs progress, errors, and important information throughout the execution.

## API/Interface Reference
The script primarily interacts with the Metriport API through the `MetriportMedicalApi` class and the `TriggerAndQueryDocRefsRemote` class.

## TODOs
- Consider adding more granular control over webhook notifications.
- Implement retry logic for failed patient queries.
- Add option to resume from a specific point in case of interruption.
