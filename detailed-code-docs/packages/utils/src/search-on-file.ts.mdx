## High-level description
This code is a utility script designed to search for multiple strings within a single large file. It reads the contents of a specified file and checks if it contains any of the given search strings, reporting the found matches.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is an asynchronous function that orchestrates the file reading and searching process. It reads the contents of the specified file, searches for the given strings, and logs the results.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the contents of the file specified by `filename` using `fs.readFileSync`.
2. Searches for each string in `whatToSearchFor` within the file contents using `Array.flatMap` and `String.includes`.
3. Logs the found matches to the console.

### `filename`
#### Description
A constant that holds the full path of the file to be searched.

### `whatToSearchFor`
#### Description
An array of strings that the script will search for within the specified file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation library |
| fs | Node.js file system module for reading files |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| filename | string | "..." | The full path of the file to be searched |
| whatToSearchFor | string[] | [] | An array of strings to search for in the file |

## Side Effects
The script reads from a file specified by `filename` and logs output to the console.

## Performance Considerations
For very large files, this script may consume significant memory as it reads the entire file contents into memory at once. For extremely large files, a streaming approach might be more appropriate.

## TODOs
The script includes a comment suggesting that users should set the `filename` and `whatToSearchFor` variables before running the script. This could be improved by accepting these as command-line arguments or environment variables for better usability.
