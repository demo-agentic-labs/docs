title: "jest.config.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file defines the Jest configuration for testing Lambda functions in a TypeScript project. It sets up the testing environment, specifies test file patterns, and configures TypeScript compilation for tests, with support for both unit and end-to-end (E2E) testing.

## Symbols

### `config`
#### Description
This constant defines the Jest configuration object of type `JestConfigWithTsJest`. It specifies various settings for running tests in the project.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a configuration object)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | JestConfigWithTsJest | Jest configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the preset to "ts-jest" for TypeScript support.
2. Configures the test environment as "node".
3. Enables verbose output.
4. Ignores test files in "/node_modules/" and "/dist/" directories.
5. Defines test file patterns based on whether it's an E2E test or not.
6. Specifies a setup file for the test environment.
7. Configures the TypeScript transformation using ts-jest with a custom tsconfig path.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| path | Used for resolving file paths |
| ts-jest | TypeScript preprocessor for Jest |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ENV_TYPE | string | "dev" | Sets the environment type for testing |
| E2E | string | N/A | Determines if E2E tests should be run when set to "true" |

## Side Effects
The script sets the `ENV_TYPE` environment variable to "dev".

## Performance Considerations
The configuration dynamically resolves the `tsconfig.json` file path, which may have a slight impact on startup time but ensures the correct TypeScript configuration is used regardless of the current working directory.

## Notes
1. The configuration supports both unit tests and E2E tests, determined by the `E2E` environment variable.
2. The `tsconfig` path is dynamically resolved to support different project structures (monorepo vs. single package).
3. The setup file `./src/__tests__/env-setup.ts` is used to configure the test environment before running tests.
