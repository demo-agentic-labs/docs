title: "tsconfig.dev.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.dev.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically tailored for development purposes. It extends the base TypeScript configuration while relaxing certain compiler options to provide a more lenient development environment.

## Code Structure
The configuration file consists of a single JSON object with two main properties: `extends` and `compilerOptions`.

## Symbols

### Root Configuration Object
#### Description
The root configuration object defines the TypeScript compiler options for the development environment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base TypeScript configuration file.
2. Overrides specific compiler options for development purposes.

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies the base configuration file that this development configuration extends from.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base TypeScript configuration file |

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This object contains specific TypeScript compiler options that are being modified for the development environment.

#### Internal Logic
Overrides two compiler options:
1. Sets `noUnusedLocals` to `false`
2. Sets `noUnusedParameters` to `false`

#### Performance Considerations
Disabling these checks may slightly improve compilation speed during development, as the TypeScript compiler will perform fewer checks.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./tsconfig | Base TypeScript configuration that this file extends |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Disables error reporting for unused local variables |
| noUnusedParameters | boolean | false | Disables error reporting for unused function parameters |

## Comments
The file includes a comment explaining the purpose of this configuration:
```
// don't worry about strictness while in development
```
This comment indicates that the purpose of this configuration is to relax certain TypeScript checks during the development process, allowing for a more flexible coding environment.
