## High-level description
This code exports the Node.js 'constants' module, making it available for use in browser environments. It serves as a compatibility layer, allowing code that relies on Node.js constants to function in browser-based JavaScript contexts.

## Symbols

### `module.exports`
#### Description
This assignment exports the entire 'constants' module from Node.js, making all its constants available to any code that requires this module.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| constants | Object | The Node.js constants module |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| constants | Provides a set of commonly used constants in Node.js |

## Notes
1. This file is likely part of a compatibility layer or polyfill for running Node.js-style code in a browser environment.
2. The 'constants' module in Node.js contains various constants related to operating system, file system, and other low-level operations.
3. In a true browser environment, this code might not work as-is, since the 'constants' module is specific to Node.js. It would likely need to be used in conjunction with a bundler or a Node.js emulation layer for browsers.
4. The purpose of this file is to maintain API compatibility between Node.js and browser environments, allowing code that depends on these constants to run in both contexts with minimal changes.
