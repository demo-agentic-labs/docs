## High-level description
This code demonstrates how to extract files from a tar archive using the `tar-stream` library. It reads a tar file, extracts its contents, and saves each file to the `/tmp` directory while logging the file names.

## Symbols

### Main Script
#### Description
The script sets up a pipeline to read a tar file, extract its contents, and save each extracted file to the `/tmp` directory.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a read stream from the 'test.tar' file.
2. Pipes the read stream through the tar extraction process.
3. For each entry in the tar file:
   - Logs the file name.
   - Creates a write stream for the file in the `/tmp` directory.
   - Pipes the entry's content to the write stream.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tar-stream | Provides functionality for extracting tar archives |
| fs | Used for file system operations (reading and writing files) |
| path | Used for manipulating file paths |
| pump | Used for piping streams (commented out in favor of `require('stream').pipeline`) |

## Side Effects
- Reads from the file system ('test.tar').
- Writes extracted files to the `/tmp` directory.
- Logs file names to the console.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default error propagation of Node.js streams.

## TODOs
The code includes a commented-out line suggesting a potential alternative for the `pump` module:
```javascript
// const pipeline = require('stream').pipeline
```
This indicates that the code might be updated in the future to use the built-in `stream.pipeline` instead of the `pump` module.
