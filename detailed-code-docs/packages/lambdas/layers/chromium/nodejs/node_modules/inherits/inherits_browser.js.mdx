## High-level description
This code implements the `inherits` function, which is used to establish prototype-based inheritance between constructor functions in JavaScript. It provides two different implementations: one for modern environments that support `Object.create`, and a fallback for older browsers.

## Symbols

### `inherits(ctor, superCtor)`
#### Description
This function sets up inheritance between two constructor functions. It makes `ctor` inherit from `superCtor` by setting up the prototype chain and preserving the constructor property.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctor | Function | The constructor function that will inherit |
| superCtor | Function | The constructor function to inherit from |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return a value. It modifies the `ctor` function and its prototype in-place.

#### Internal Logic
The function has two implementations based on the environment's capabilities:

1. Modern implementation (if `Object.create` is available):
   - Sets `ctor.super_` to `superCtor` for reference.
   - Uses `Object.create` to set up the prototype chain.
   - Explicitly sets the `constructor` property on the new prototype.

2. Legacy implementation (fallback for older browsers):
   - Sets `ctor.super_` to `superCtor` for reference.
   - Creates a temporary constructor `TempCtor`.
   - Sets `TempCtor.prototype` to `superCtor.prototype`.
   - Creates a new instance of `TempCtor` and assigns it to `ctor.prototype`.
   - Explicitly sets the `constructor` property on the new prototype.

## Side Effects
This function modifies the input `ctor` function by setting its `super_` property and replacing its `prototype`.

## Performance Considerations
The modern implementation using `Object.create` is generally more efficient and is preferred when available. The legacy implementation creates an additional function and object instance, which may have a slight performance impact.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses built-in JavaScript functionality.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement any specific error handling. It assumes that valid constructor functions are provided as arguments.

## Notes
1. The `super_` property is a non-standard addition that allows access to the superclass constructor from the subclass.
2. The legacy implementation uses a common technique known as the "temporary constructor" pattern to avoid calling the superclass constructor during inheritance setup.
3. This implementation is similar to Node.js's `util.inherits` function, providing a browser-compatible version.
