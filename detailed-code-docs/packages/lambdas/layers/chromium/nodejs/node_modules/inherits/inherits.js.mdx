title: "inherits.js"

## High-level description
This code implements a fallback mechanism for the `inherits` function. It first attempts to use Node.js's built-in `util.inherits` function, and if that fails, it falls back to a browser-compatible version of `inherits`.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a single try-catch block that determines which version of `inherits` to export.

### Main Module
#### Description
The main module attempts to load and export the `util.inherits` function from Node.js's built-in `util` module. If that fails, it falls back to a browser-compatible version.

#### Internal Logic
1. The code attempts to require the `util` module.
2. It checks if `util.inherits` is a function.
3. If `util.inherits` is available and is a function, it exports that.
4. If an error occurs at any point (e.g., `util` module not found or `util.inherits` is not a function), it catches the error and exports a browser-compatible version of `inherits` from './inherits_browser.js'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| util | Node.js built-in module for utility functions, including `inherits` |
| ./inherits_browser.js | Fallback implementation of `inherits` for browser environments |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-catch block to handle potential errors when requiring the `util` module or accessing `util.inherits`. If any error occurs, it silently falls back to the browser-compatible version.

## Notes
1. The code uses `/* istanbul ignore next */` comments, which are directives for the Istanbul code coverage tool to ignore certain lines or blocks during coverage reporting.
2. The fallback mechanism ensures that the module can work in both Node.js and browser environments, providing a consistent `inherits` function regardless of the runtime environment.
