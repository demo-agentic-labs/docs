## High-level description
This code exports the `EventEmitter` class from the `events` module in a browser environment. It serves as a compatibility layer for the `readable-stream` package, providing a browser-specific implementation of the stream functionality.

## Symbols

### `module.exports`
#### Description
This assignment exports the `EventEmitter` class from the `events` module, making it available for use in other parts of the application that require this module.

#### Inputs
N/A

## Notes
1. This file is part of the `readable-stream` package, which is a compatibility layer for Node.js's stream implementation.
2. The file is specifically tailored for browser environments, as indicated by the `-browser` suffix in the filename.
3. By exporting the `EventEmitter` class, this module allows other parts of the application to create and manage event-driven objects in a browser context.
4. The use of `require('events').EventEmitter` suggests that this code is designed to work with a browserify-like environment that provides CommonJS-style module resolution in the browser.

This simple one-line module plays a crucial role in ensuring that the `readable-stream` package can provide consistent stream functionality across different JavaScript environments, including browsers.
