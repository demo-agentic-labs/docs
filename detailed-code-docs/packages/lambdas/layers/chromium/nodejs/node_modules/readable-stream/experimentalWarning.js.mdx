title: "experimentalWarning.js"

## High-level description
This code defines a module that provides a mechanism for emitting experimental feature warnings in Node.js applications. It ensures that each experimental feature warning is emitted only once per runtime to avoid repetitive warnings.

## Symbols

### `experimentalWarnings`
#### Description
A `Set` object used to keep track of experimental features that have already been warned about.

### `emitExperimentalWarning(feature)`
#### Description
A function that emits a warning for an experimental feature if it hasn't been warned about before.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| feature | string | The name of the experimental feature |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the feature has already been warned about using the `experimentalWarnings` Set.
2. If not warned before, constructs a warning message.
3. Adds the feature to the `experimentalWarnings` Set.
4. Emits the warning using `process.emitWarning()`.

### `noop()`
#### Description
An empty function that does nothing. Used as a fallback when `process.emitWarning` is not available.

### `module.exports.emitExperimentalWarning`
#### Description
Exports either the `emitExperimentalWarning` function or the `noop` function, depending on whether `process.emitWarning` is available in the current environment.

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic form of error handling by checking for the existence of `process.emitWarning`. If it's not available, the module exports a no-operation function instead of the warning emitter to prevent runtime errors.

## Logging
While not traditional logging, this module uses `process.emitWarning()` to emit warnings about experimental features, which can be considered a form of runtime logging or notification.

## Performance Considerations
The use of a `Set` to track warned features ensures that each feature is only warned about once, reducing redundant warnings and potentially improving performance in scenarios where the same experimental features might be used multiple times.
