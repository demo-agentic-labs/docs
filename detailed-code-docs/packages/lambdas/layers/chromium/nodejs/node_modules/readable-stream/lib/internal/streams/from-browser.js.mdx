title: "from-browser.js"
---

## High-level description
This code exports a function that throws an error when called, indicating that the `Readable.from` method is not available in browser environments.

## Symbols

### Anonymous Function
#### Description
This is an anonymous function that is immediately exported as the module's default export. When called, it throws an error with a specific message.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value. Instead, it always throws an error.

#### Internal Logic
The function's sole purpose is to throw an Error object with the message "Readable.from is not available in the browser".

## Side Effects
When called, this function will throw an error, which, if not caught, will terminate the execution of the current script.

## Error Handling
This module is entirely focused on error handling. It creates a specific error to be thrown when attempting to use `Readable.from` in a browser environment.

## Dependencies
This module does not have any external dependencies. It uses only the built-in `Error` object.

## Notes
This code is likely part of a larger streaming library, specifically the `readable-stream` package. The purpose of this file is to provide a browser-specific implementation (or in this case, a non-implementation) of the `Readable.from` method. In Node.js environments, `Readable.from` is a utility method to create readable streams from various sources. However, this functionality is not supported or implemented for browser environments, hence the error when attempting to use it.

The naming convention of the file (`from-browser.js`) suggests that this might be used as a replacement or fallback implementation when the package is used in a browser context, ensuring that attempts to use `Readable.from` in browsers result in a clear error message rather than undefined behavior.
