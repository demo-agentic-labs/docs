title: "_stream_passthrough.js"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a PassThrough stream, which is a minimal implementation of a Transform stream. It simply passes input data through without any modification, making it useful for scenarios where you need to maintain a consistent streaming interface without altering the data.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single `PassThrough` class that extends the `Transform` stream class. It overrides the `_transform` method to implement the pass-through behavior.

## References
- `./_stream_transform`: The base Transform stream class that PassThrough extends.
- `inherits`: A utility function used for inheritance.

## Symbols

### PassThrough
#### Description
A class that implements a pass-through stream, extending the Transform stream. It outputs every written chunk as-is without any modification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Object | (Optional) Configuration options for the stream |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the function is called as a constructor. If not, it creates a new instance.
2. Calls the parent Transform constructor with the provided options.
3. Implements the `_transform` method to pass chunks through without modification.

### PassThrough.prototype._transform
#### Description
The core method that defines the behavior of the PassThrough stream. It simply passes the input chunk to the callback without any changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chunk | Buffer/String | The chunk of data to be transformed |
| encoding | String | The encoding of the chunk (if it's a string) |
| cb | Function | Callback to be called after processing the chunk |

#### Outputs
The method doesn't return anything directly, but it calls the callback with:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | null | Always null as no error occurs in this simple pass-through |
| chunk | Buffer/String | The same chunk that was input |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./_stream_transform | Provides the base Transform stream class |
| inherits | Utility for implementing inheritance |

## Error Handling
This implementation doesn't include any specific error handling. Errors would be handled by the underlying Transform stream implementation.

## Performance Considerations
The PassThrough stream is designed to be minimal and efficient, simply passing data through without any processing. This makes it very performant, with negligible overhead compared to directly piping data.
