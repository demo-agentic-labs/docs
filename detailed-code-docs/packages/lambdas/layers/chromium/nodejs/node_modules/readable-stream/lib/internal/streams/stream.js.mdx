title: "stream.js"
---

## High-level description
This code exports the built-in Node.js 'stream' module. It serves as a simple wrapper or re-export of the core 'stream' functionality, making it available for use in the 'readable-stream' package.

## Symbols

### `module.exports`
#### Description
This line exports the entire 'stream' module from Node.js core, making all of its functionality available to any code that requires this file.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stream | Module | The entire Node.js 'stream' module |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| stream | Core Node.js module that provides a base abstract interface for working with streaming data |

## Notes
1. This file is part of the 'readable-stream' package, which is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in Node.js core.
2. By re-exporting the core 'stream' module, this file allows the 'readable-stream' package to provide consistent stream functionality across different Node.js versions and environments.
3. The use of `require('stream')` suggests that this code is intended to run in a Node.js environment, where the 'stream' module is available as a built-in module.
4. This simple re-export allows other parts of the 'readable-stream' package to build upon or modify the core stream functionality if needed, while still providing access to the original implementation.

While this file itself is very simple, it plays an important role in the structure of the 'readable-stream' package, ensuring that the package can provide consistent stream behavior across different Node.js versions and potentially polyfill newer stream features for older Node.js versions.
