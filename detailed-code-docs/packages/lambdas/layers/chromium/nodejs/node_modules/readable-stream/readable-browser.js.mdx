## High-level description
This code exports various stream-related modules from the 'readable-stream' package for use in browser environments. It provides a unified interface for working with different types of streams, including Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform, and PassThrough streams, as well as utility functions for stream operations.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a series of export statements that make different stream modules and utility functions available for use. The main export is set to the Readable stream module, while other stream types and utilities are exported as named properties.

## Symbols

### `exports`
#### Description
The main export of the module, which is set to the Readable stream implementation. It also serves as a container for other exported stream types and utilities.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the main export to the Readable stream implementation.
- Adds additional properties to the exports object for other stream types and utilities.

### `exports.Stream`
#### Description
An alias for the main Readable stream export, providing backward compatibility or alternative naming.

### `exports.Readable`
#### Description
Another alias for the main Readable stream export, explicitly naming it as Readable.

### `exports.Writable`
#### Description
Exports the Writable stream implementation from the '_stream_writable.js' module.

### `exports.Duplex`
#### Description
Exports the Duplex stream implementation from the '_stream_duplex.js' module.

### `exports.Transform`
#### Description
Exports the Transform stream implementation from the '_stream_transform.js' module.

### `exports.PassThrough`
#### Description
Exports the PassThrough stream implementation from the '_stream_passthrough.js' module.

### `exports.finished`
#### Description
Exports the 'finished' utility function from the 'end-of-stream.js' module, which is likely used to detect when a stream has finished or ended.

### `exports.pipeline`
#### Description
Exports the 'pipeline' utility function from the 'pipeline.js' module, which is probably used for piping data through multiple streams.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| './lib/_stream_readable.js' | Provides the Readable stream implementation |
| './lib/_stream_writable.js' | Provides the Writable stream implementation |
| './lib/_stream_duplex.js' | Provides the Duplex stream implementation |
| './lib/_stream_transform.js' | Provides the Transform stream implementation |
| './lib/_stream_passthrough.js' | Provides the PassThrough stream implementation |
| './lib/internal/streams/end-of-stream.js' | Provides the 'finished' utility function |
| './lib/internal/streams/pipeline.js' | Provides the 'pipeline' utility function |

This code serves as a central export point for various stream-related functionalities, making it easy for developers to import and use different types of streams and stream utilities in their browser-based JavaScript applications.
