## High-level description
This code implements IEEE 754 floating-point number reading and writing functions. It provides two main functions: `read` for converting a buffer to a floating-point number, and `write` for converting a floating-point number to a buffer representation.

## Symbols

### `read`
#### Description
This function reads a floating-point number from a buffer according to the IEEE 754 standard.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buffer | Array-like | The buffer containing the binary representation of the number |
| offset | Number | The starting position in the buffer to read from |
| isLE | Boolean | Indicates if the buffer is in little-endian format |
| mLen | Number | The length of the mantissa in bits |
| nBytes | Number | The total number of bytes to read |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Number | The decoded floating-point number |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract the sign bit.
2. Read the exponent bits.
3. Read the mantissa bits.
4. Handle special cases (zero, infinity, NaN).
5. Compute and return the final floating-point value.

### `write`
#### Description
This function writes a floating-point number to a buffer according to the IEEE 754 standard.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buffer | Array-like | The buffer to write the binary representation of the number to |
| value | Number | The floating-point number to encode |
| offset | Number | The starting position in the buffer to write to |
| isLE | Boolean | Indicates if the buffer should be in little-endian format |
| mLen | Number | The length of the mantissa in bits |
| nBytes | Number | The total number of bytes to write |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return a value but modifies the input buffer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Handle special cases (NaN, Infinity).
2. Normalize the value and calculate the exponent.
3. Calculate the mantissa.
4. Write the sign bit, exponent, and mantissa to the buffer.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies. It relies only on JavaScript's built-in `Math` object.

## Performance Considerations
Both `read` and `write` functions use bit manipulation and low-level operations for efficiency. They avoid creating unnecessary objects or arrays, operating directly on the input buffer.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes correct input parameters and relies on JavaScript's behavior for invalid operations (e.g., returning NaN for certain calculations).

## Side Effects
Both functions modify the input buffer directly, which is an intended side effect of their operation.
