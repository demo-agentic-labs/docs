title: "tsconfig.cloud.json"

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.cloud.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically tailored for cloud-based deployments. It extends the base TypeScript configuration while adding specific compiler options and excluding certain directories and files from compilation.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `compilerOptions`, and `exclude`.

## Symbols

### Root Configuration Object
#### Description
The root object defines the TypeScript compiler configuration for cloud-based deployments.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base TypeScript configuration.
2. Specifies additional compiler options.
3. Excludes certain directories and files from compilation.

### `extends`
#### Description
This property specifies that this configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base TypeScript configuration file |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration extends `"./tsconfig"`, which likely refers to a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory. This allows for a hierarchical configuration setup, where common settings are defined in the base file and specific settings are added or overridden in this cloud-specific configuration.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
This object specifies additional compiler options for the TypeScript compiler when building for cloud deployment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sourceMap | boolean | Enables generation of source map files |
| inlineSources | boolean | Includes the original source code in the source map |

#### Internal Logic
- `sourceMap: true`: This option tells the TypeScript compiler to generate source map files (.map files) alongside the compiled JavaScript files. Source maps allow for easier debugging by mapping the compiled code back to the original TypeScript source.
- `inlineSources: true`: This option instructs the compiler to include the original TypeScript source code in the source map. This can be useful for debugging in environments where the original source files might not be available.

### `exclude`
#### Description
This array specifies files and directories that should be excluded from the TypeScript compilation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exclude | string[] | Array of glob patterns for files and directories to exclude |

#### Internal Logic
The following items are excluded from compilation:
- `"dist"`: Likely the output directory for compiled files.
- `"node_modules"`: The directory containing third-party dependencies.
- `"layers"`: Possibly a directory containing AWS Lambda layers or similar cloud-specific resources.
- `"static"`: Likely a directory containing static assets.
- `"./src/**/__tests__/*"`: All files within `__tests__` directories under the `src` directory, typically used for test files.

## Dependencies
This configuration file indirectly depends on the base TypeScript configuration file it extends (`./tsconfig`).

## Configuration
The main configuration options defined in this file are:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| sourceMap | boolean | true | Enables generation of source map files |
| inlineSources | boolean | true | Includes the original source code in the source map |

These options are specifically set for cloud deployments, likely to aid in debugging and error tracking in cloud environments.
