## High-level description
This file is a configuration file for Prettier, a popular code formatting tool. It defines specific formatting rules to be applied to the codebase in the `packages/lambdas` directory, ensuring consistent code style across the project.

## Symbols

### `.prettierrc.yaml`
#### Description
This YAML file contains configuration options for Prettier. Each key-value pair represents a specific formatting rule that Prettier will enforce when run on the codebase.

#### Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| printWidth | number | 100 | Sets the line length at which Prettier will wrap code |
| tabWidth | number | 2 | Specifies the number of spaces per indentation level |
| useTabs | boolean | false | Instructs Prettier to use spaces for indentation instead of tabs |
| semi | boolean | true | Ensures that statements are terminated with semicolons |
| singleQuote | boolean | false | Configures Prettier to use double quotes for strings |
| trailingComma | string | "es5" | Adds trailing commas where valid in ES5 (objects, arrays, etc.) |
| bracketSpacing | boolean | true | Adds spaces between brackets in object literals |
| arrowParens | string | "avoid" | Omits parentheses around a sole arrow function parameter when possible |

## Dependencies
This configuration file is specifically for Prettier, so it implicitly depends on the Prettier library being used in the project.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Prettier | Code formatting tool that uses this configuration |

## Notes
1. This configuration will apply to all files in the `packages/lambdas` directory and its subdirectories, unless overridden by more specific configuration files.
2. The settings chosen here suggest a preference for readability (e.g., longer line length, spaces instead of tabs) and adherence to common JavaScript conventions (e.g., using semicolons, double quotes).
3. The `trailingComma` setting is set to "es5", which is a good balance between modern practices and compatibility with older JavaScript environments.
4. The `arrowParens` setting is set to "avoid", which results in more concise arrow function declarations when possible.
