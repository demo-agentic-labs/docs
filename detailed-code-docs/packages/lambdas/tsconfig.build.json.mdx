title: "tsconfig.build.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.build.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically for building the lambdas package. It extends the base TypeScript configuration defined in the `tsconfig.json` file located in the same directory.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single JSON object with one property:

### `extends`
#### Description
The `extends` property is used to specify another TypeScript configuration file that this configuration should inherit from. In this case, it's set to `"./tsconfig"`, which means it's extending the configuration from a file named `tsconfig.json` in the same directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | The path to the base configuration file |

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the existence of a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory.

## Configuration
This file is part of the TypeScript configuration for the project. It's specifically named `tsconfig.build.json`, which suggests it's used for build processes, potentially separate from development or testing configurations.

By extending the base `tsconfig.json`, this file inherits all the compiler options and other settings defined in the base file. This approach allows for maintaining a common set of TypeScript settings across different build processes or environments while providing the flexibility to override or add specific settings for building the lambdas package if needed.

Note that in this particular case, no additional settings or overrides are specified in this file. This means that the build configuration for the lambdas package is identical to the base configuration. If there were any build-specific settings needed for the lambdas package, they would be added to this file.
