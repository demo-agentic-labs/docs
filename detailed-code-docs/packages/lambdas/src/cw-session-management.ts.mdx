## High-level description
This Lambda function manages the session with CommonWell Health Alliance's management portal. It keeps the session active by logging in, obtaining cookies, and updating them in the secret manager. It uses Playwright for browser automation and handles code challenges during the login process.

## Code Structure
The main handler function interacts with various imported modules and classes to manage the CommonWell session. It uses AWS services like S3 and Secrets Manager, and external libraries like Playwright for browser automation. The code is structured to handle errors, capture screenshots, and log important information throughout the process.

## Symbols

### `handler`

#### Outputs
None explicitly defined, but it may throw errors.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves credentials from AWS Secrets Manager.
2. Launches a Chromium browser using Playwright.
3. Initializes a `SessionManagement` instance with necessary configurations.

| Object | \{ username: string, password: string \} | CommonWell credentials |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches the secret using the `cwCredsSecretName` environment variable.
2. Parses the secret string as JSON.
3. Validates the presence of username and password.
4. Returns the credentials object.

### `reportErrorToS3`
#### Description
Reports errors by uploading screenshots to S3.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
