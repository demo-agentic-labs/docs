## High-level description
This code implements an AWS Lambda function that transfers messages from one SQS queue (source) to another (destination). It retrieves messages from the source queue, sends them to the destination queue, and then deletes them from the source queue. The function is wrapped with Sentry for error tracking and logging.

## Code Structure
The main handler function is exported and wrapped with Sentry. It uses AWS SDK to interact with SQS queues. Helper functions are defined to process message attributes. The code also uses environment variables for configuration and imports utility functions from shared modules.

## References
- `capture` from "./shared/capture"
- `getEnv` and `getEnvOrFail` from "./shared/env"

## Symbols

### `handler`
#### Description
The main Lambda function handler that processes SQS events. It retrieves messages from the source queue, sends them to the destination queue, and deletes them from the source queue.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | SQSEvent | The SQS event triggered by AWS Lambda |

#### Internal Logic
1. Log configuration details
2. Attempt to receive messages from the source queue
3. For each received message:
   - Send the message to the destination queue
   - Delete the message from the source queue
4. Handle errors and log them using Sentry

### `attributesToSend`
#### Description
Processes the message attributes to be sent with the new message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| inboundMessageAttribs | MessageBodyAttributeMap | The original message attributes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | object | Processed message attributes |

### `singleAttributeToSend`
#### Description
Formats a single message attribute for sending.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The attribute name |
| value | MessageAttributeValue | The attribute value |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | object | Formatted attribute object |

## Side Effects
- Reads from and writes to SQS queues
- Logs information and errors
- Sends error data to Sentry

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @sentry/serverless | Error tracking and monitoring |
| aws-lambda | AWS Lambda types |
| aws-sdk | AWS SDK for interacting with SQS |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| numberOfMessagesPerRetry | number | 1 | Number of messages to process per Lambda invocation |
| SOURCE_QUEUE | string | N/A | URL of the source SQS queue |
| DESTINATION_QUEUE | string | N/A | URL of the destination SQS queue |
| AWS_REGION | string | N/A | AWS region for SQS operations |

## Error Handling
Errors are caught in the main try-catch block of the handler function. When an error occurs, it is logged to the console and captured by Sentry with additional context information. The error is then re-thrown, which will cause the Lambda function to fail and potentially trigger a retry based on the queue's configuration.

## Logging
The code uses console.log for logging various steps of the process, including configuration details, message reception, sending, and deletion. Errors are logged using console.log and Sentry's error capture.
