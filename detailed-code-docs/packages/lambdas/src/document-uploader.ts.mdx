## High-level description
This code defines an AWS Lambda function handler for processing S3 events related to document uploads. It uses the `documentUploaderHandler` from the core package to handle the upload process, including copying the file to a destination bucket and updating document references.

## Code Structure
The main handler function processes S3 events, extracting relevant information and calling the `documentUploaderHandler` for each record. It also includes error handling and logging using a capture utility.

## References
- `@metriport/core/external/aws/lambda-logic/document-uploader`: Imports the `documentUploaderHandler` function.
- `./shared/capture`: Imports the `capture` utility for error logging and monitoring.
- `./shared/env`: Imports the `getEnvOrFail` function for retrieving environment variables.

## Symbols

### `handler`
#### Description
This is the main Lambda function handler that processes S3 events for document uploads.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | S3Event | The S3 event triggered by file uploads |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the capture utility for error logging.
2. Retrieves necessary environment variables.
3. Iterates through each record in the S3 event.
4. Extracts source bucket and key information.
5. Constructs the API endpoint URL.
6. Calls the `documentUploaderHandler` with the extracted information.
7. Handles and logs any errors or messages returned by the handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/external/aws/lambda-logic/document-uploader | Provides the main document upload handling logic |
| aws-lambda | Provides the S3Event type for the Lambda function |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_URL | string | N/A | The base URL for the API endpoint |
| MEDICAL_DOCUMENTS_DESTINATION_BUCKET | string | N/A | The destination S3 bucket for medical documents |
| AWS_REGION | string | N/A | The AWS region where the Lambda function is running |

## Error Handling
The code implements try-catch blocks to handle errors during the document upload process. Errors are logged using the `capture.error` method, which likely sends the error information to a monitoring service like Sentry.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` for basic logging and the `capture` utility for more detailed error logging and monitoring.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this file, but there is a comment to keep the capture initialization as early in the file as possible.
