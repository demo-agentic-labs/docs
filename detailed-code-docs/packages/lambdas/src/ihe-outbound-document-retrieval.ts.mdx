## High-level description
This code defines a Lambda function handler for processing outbound document retrieval results in a healthcare information exchange (IHE) system. It uses the Sentry error tracking service and implements a polling mechanism to retrieve and process results from multiple gateways.

## Code Structure
The main component is the Lambda handler, which is wrapped with Sentry for error tracking. It uses environment variables for configuration and initializes a poller to process outbound document retrieval results.

## Symbols

### `handler`
#### Description
This is the main Lambda function handler, wrapped with Sentry for error tracking. It initializes and executes the outbound result poller.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requestId | string | Unique identifier for the request |
| numOfGateways | number | Number of gateways to poll |
| patientId | string | Identifier for the patient |
| cxId | string | Customer identifier |

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the execution environment and input parameters.
2. Retrieves database credentials from AWS Secrets Manager.
3. Initializes an `OutboundResultPollerDirect` instance.
4. Calls the `pollOutboundDocRetrievalResults` method with the provided parameters and configuration.
5. Catches and logs any errors, reporting them to Sentry.

## Side Effects
- Logs information to the console.
- Interacts with AWS Secrets Manager to retrieve database credentials.
- Potentially modifies external state through the `OutboundResultPollerDirect` instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core | Provides various utility functions and classes |
| @sentry/serverless | Error tracking and monitoring |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DB_CREDS | string | N/A | ARN for database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager |
| API_URL | string | N/A | URL for the API |
| AWS_REGION | string | N/A | AWS region |
| MAX_POLLING_DURATION | string | N/A | Maximum duration for polling (in milliseconds) |

## Error Handling
Errors are caught in the main try-catch block, logged to the console, and reported to Sentry with additional context information.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` for logging execution details and errors.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
