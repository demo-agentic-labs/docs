## High-level description
This code defines a Lambda function handler that serves as a tester to validate and test functionality in a cloud environment. It makes an HTTP GET request to a specified API URL and logs the response, demonstrating basic connectivity and functionality of the deployed environment.

## Code Structure
The code initializes error capturing, sets up an axios instance for making HTTP requests, and defines a Lambda handler function wrapped with Sentry for error tracking.

## References
- `@metriport/shared`: Used for retrieving environment variables.
- `@sentry/serverless`: Used for error tracking and wrapping the Lambda handler.
- `./shared/capture`: Used for initializing error capturing.

## Symbols

### `capture.init()`
#### Description
Initializes the error capturing mechanism. This function is called at the beginning of the file to set up error tracking.

### `api`
#### Description
An axios instance created with a timeout of 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds) for making HTTP requests.

### `handler`
#### Description
The main Lambda function handler, wrapped with Sentry for error tracking.

#### Inputs
None explicitly defined, but as a Lambda handler, it typically receives event and context objects.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | Promise&lt;void&gt; | Resolves when the function execution is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the start of execution.
2. Retrieves the API URL from an environment variable.
3. Makes a GET request to the API URL using the axios instance.
4. Logs the response status and body.
5. Logs completion of execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Provides utility function for retrieving environment variables |
| @sentry/serverless | Provides error tracking and Lambda handler wrapping |
| axios | Used for making HTTP requests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_URL | string | N/A | The URL of the API to be tested, retrieved from environment variables |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through Sentry, which wraps the Lambda handler. Any unhandled exceptions will be captured and reported to Sentry.

## Logging
The code uses console.log for basic logging of execution steps and API response details.
