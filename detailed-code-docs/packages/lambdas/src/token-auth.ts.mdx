title: "token-auth.ts"

## High-level description
This code implements an AWS Lambda function that serves as a token-based authentication mechanism for an API Gateway. It validates API tokens stored in DynamoDB and generates appropriate IAM policy documents to allow or deny access to API resources.

## Code Structure
The main handler function is wrapped with Sentry for error tracking. It processes the incoming event, extracts the token, validates it against a DynamoDB table, and returns an IAM policy document with the appropriate effect (Allow or Deny) based on the token's validity.

## References
- The code references the `capture` module from "./shared/capture" for error tracking initialization.
- It uses the `getEnvOrFail` function from "./shared/env" to retrieve environment variables.

## Symbols

### `curSecSinceEpoch`
#### Description
A helper function that calculates the current UTC time in seconds since the Unix epoch.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | number | Current UTC time in seconds since the Unix epoch |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new Date object
2. Calculates UTC milliseconds by adding the timezone offset
3. Converts milliseconds to seconds and rounds the result

### `handler`
#### Description
The main Lambda function handler that processes the authentication request and generates an IAM policy document.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | lambda.APIGatewayRequestAuthorizerEvent | The API Gateway request event containing headers and query parameters |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | object | An object containing the principal ID, policy document, and context |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the API token from the request headers or query parameters
2. If a token is present, queries DynamoDB to validate the token
3. Checks if the token is valid and not expired
4. Generates an IAM policy document with the appropriate effect (Allow or Deny)
5. Returns the policy document along with context information

## Side Effects
- The function interacts with DynamoDB to retrieve token information
- Logs are written to the console for debugging purposes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @sentry/serverless | Error tracking and monitoring |
| aws-lambda | Types for AWS Lambda functions |
| aws-sdk | AWS SDK for interacting with DynamoDB |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| TOKEN_TABLE_NAME | string | N/A | The name of the DynamoDB table storing API tokens |

## Error Handling
Errors during DynamoDB operations are caught and logged to the console. However, they do not affect the function's flow, and the function continues to return a "Deny" effect in case of errors.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` and `console.error` for logging event information and errors, respectively.

## TODOs
There is a commented question: "Don't we want to throw an error here?" in the catch block of the DynamoDB query. This suggests that error handling might need to be reviewed and potentially improved.
