## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `sleep` that creates a delay in the execution of asynchronous code for a specified amount of time. It uses JavaScript's Promise and setTimeout to achieve this functionality.

## Symbols

### `sleep`
#### Description
The `sleep` function is a utility that creates a pause in the execution of asynchronous code for a specified duration. It wraps the `setTimeout` function in a Promise, allowing for easy use with async/await syntax or Promise chains.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timeInMs | number | The time to sleep in milliseconds |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A Promise that resolves after the specified time has elapsed |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function creates and returns a new Promise.
2. Inside the Promise constructor, it uses `setTimeout` to delay the resolution of the Promise.
3. The `resolve` function is passed as the callback to `setTimeout`, which will be called after `timeInMs` milliseconds have passed.
4. When `setTimeout` triggers, it calls `resolve`, fulfilling the Promise and allowing any awaiting code to continue execution.

## Usage Example
Although not shown in the provided code, the `sleep` function can be used in async functions like this:

```typescript
async function example() {
  console.log("Starting");
  await sleep(2000); // Pauses execution for 2 seconds
  console.log("Resumed after 2 seconds");
}
```

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to introduce deliberate delays in your code, such as rate limiting API calls, simulating network latency in tests, or creating timed sequences of events.
