## High-level description
This code defines a function `getFileInfoFromS3` that retrieves metadata about a file stored in Amazon S3. It uses the AWS SDK to interact with S3 and returns information about the file's existence, size, and content type.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary dependencies, sets up an S3 client, and exports a single function `getFileInfoFromS3`.

## References
- `makeS3Client` from "@metriport/core/external/aws/s3"
- `getEnvOrFail` from "./env"

## Symbols

### `getFileInfoFromS3`
#### Description
This function retrieves metadata about a file in an S3 bucket. It attempts to get the file's head object and returns information about its existence, size, and content type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The key (path) of the file in the S3 bucket |
| bucket | string | The name of the S3 bucket |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing file information |

The result object has two possible structures:
1. If the file exists: `{ exists: true, size: number, contentType: string }`
2. If the file doesn't exist: `{ exists: false }`

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the S3 client to call the `headObject` method with the provided bucket and key.
2. If successful, it returns an object indicating the file exists, along with its size and content type.
3. If an error occurs (likely because the file doesn't exist), it catches the error and returns an object indicating the file doesn't exist.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/external/aws/s3 | Provides the `makeS3Client` function to create an S3 client |
| ./env | Provides the `getEnvOrFail` function to retrieve environment variables |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| AWS_REGION | string | N/A | The AWS region for the S3 client, retrieved from environment variables |

## Error Handling
The function uses a try-catch block to handle potential errors when calling `headObject`. If an error occurs, it assumes the file doesn't exist and returns `{ exists: false }` instead of throwing an error.

## Performance Considerations
The function makes a single API call to S3, which should be relatively quick for retrieving metadata. However, in high-volume scenarios, consider implementing caching or batching requests to improve performance.
