## High-level description
This code defines two utility functions for converting kilobytes (KB) to megabytes (MB). The functions are designed to facilitate the conversion and formatting of memory-related values, which is particularly useful in the context of reporting system metrics.

## Symbols

### `kbToMbString`
#### Description
This function converts a value in kilobytes to megabytes and returns it as a formatted string with two decimal places and the "MB" suffix.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type   | Description                           |
|:------|:-------|:--------------------------------------|
| value | number | The value in kilobytes to be converted|

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                                        |
|:-------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| result | string | The converted value in MB with 2 decimal places and "MB" suffix |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `kbToMb` function to convert the input value from KB to MB.
2. Uses `Number().toFixed(2)` to round the result to two decimal places.
3. Appends "MB" to the formatted number.

### `kbToMb`
#### Description
This function performs the actual conversion of a value from kilobytes to megabytes.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type   | Description                           |
|:------|:-------|:--------------------------------------|
| value | number | The value in kilobytes to be converted|

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                    |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------------------------|
| result | number | The converted value in megabytes |

#### Internal Logic
Divides the input value by 1048576 (1024 * 1024) to convert from KB to MB.

## References
These functions are used in the `CloudWatchUtils` class in the `cloudwatch.ts` file, specifically in the `reportMemoryUsage` method. They are used to format memory usage data before logging and sending metrics to CloudWatch.

## Dependencies
This code does not rely on any external libraries or modules.

## Performance Considerations
The conversion operations are simple arithmetic calculations and should have minimal performance impact. However, when used in high-frequency operations or with very large numbers, the floating-point division in `kbToMb` might introduce small rounding errors.
