## High-level description
This code provides utility functions to clean up XML payloads by removing specific attributes and replacing certain elements. It's designed to preprocess XML data, likely for a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) conversion process.

## Symbols

### `cleanUpPayload`
#### Description
This function serves as the main entry point for cleaning up the XML payload. It applies two cleanup operations sequentially: removing "CD UNK" type attributes and replacing null flavor id elements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payloadRaw | string | The raw XML payload to be cleaned up |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payloadNoNullFlavor | string | The cleaned XML payload |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `removeCDUNK` to remove "CD UNK" type attributes
2. Calls `removeNullFlavor` on the result to replace null flavor id elements

### `removeCDUNK`
#### Description
This function removes the "UNK" (unknown) qualifier from "CD" (Concept Descriptor) type attributes in the XML.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payloadRaw | string | The XML payload to process |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The XML with "CD UNK" replaced by "CD" |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a regular expression to find and replace all occurrences of `xsi:type="CD UNK"` with `xsi:type="CD"`.

### `removeNullFlavor`
#### Description
This function replaces `id` elements with a `nullFlavor` attribute with a standard `id` element containing default values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payloadRaw | string | The XML payload to process |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The XML with null flavor id elements replaced |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a regular expression to find and replace all `&lt;id&gt;` elements that have a `nullFlavor` attribute with `&lt;id extension="1" root="1"/&gt;`.

## References
This code is referenced and used in the `sqs-to-converter.ts` file, specifically in the `handler` function where `cleanUpPayload` is called on the XML payload retrieved from S3 before it's sent to the FHIR converter.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It relies solely on JavaScript's built-in String and RegExp objects.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this code. Any errors that occur during the string replacement operations will propagate to the calling function.

## Performance Considerations
The use of regular expressions for string manipulation is generally efficient for most use cases. However, for extremely large XML payloads, the performance impact should be monitored, especially if this function is called frequently.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
