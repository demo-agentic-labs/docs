## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the Lambda functions in the project. It includes tests for document downloading, environment setup, and SQS to converter functionality. The tests are designed to verify the correct behavior of these components and ensure they work as expected in different scenarios.

## What does it do?
The test files in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Document Downloader Test: Verifies the ability to extract base64-encoded content from an XML document. This test is currently skipped and intended for local execution only.

2. Environment Setup: Configures the testing environment by loading environment variables from `.env` and `.env.test` files. It ensures that the correct variables are loaded regardless of the current working directory, accommodating both local development and CI/CD pipeline scenarios.

3. SQS to Converter Test: Checks the `cleanUpPayload` function from the `sqs-to-converter` module, specifically testing the scenario where the input XML doesn't contain any "UNK" or "nullFlavor" elements.

## Key Files

1. `document-downloader.test.ts`:
   - Contains a skipped test suite for the document downloader functionality.
   - Tests the extraction of base64-encoded content from an XML document.
   - Uses the `xmldom` library for parsing XML.

2. `env-setup.ts`:
   - Sets up the environment for testing by loading environment variables.
   - Uses the `dotenv` library to load variables from `.env` and `.env.test` files.
   - Adapts the file path based on the current working directory.

3. `sqs-to-converter.test.ts`:
   - Tests the `cleanUpPayload` function from the `sqs-to-converter` module.
   - Verifies that the function returns the original XML unchanged when there are no "UNK" or "nullFlavor" elements present.

## Dependencies
1. Jest: Used as the testing framework across all test files.
2. xmldom: Used in `document-downloader.test.ts` for parsing XML strings into DOM documents.
3. dotenv: Used in `env-setup.ts` for loading environment variables from `.env` files.
4. path: Used in `env-setup.ts` for resolving file paths.

## Configuration
The `env-setup.ts` file handles configuration for the test environment:

- Loads environment variables from `.env` and `.env.test` files.
- Constructs the path to `.env.test` dynamically based on the current working directory.
- Modifies `process.env` by loading these environment variables.

## Notes
- The document downloader test is currently skipped (`describe.skip`), indicating it should not be run in CI/CD environments. This suggests a potential TODO to either remove the skip or implement a way to run this test locally only.
- The environment setup is designed to work correctly whether run from the root of the project or from within the `packages/lambdas` directory.
- The SQS to converter test focuses on a specific scenario where no cleanup is required, ensuring the function doesn't modify XML that doesn't need changes.

These tests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the Lambda functions in the project, covering various aspects from environment setup to specific functionality testing.
