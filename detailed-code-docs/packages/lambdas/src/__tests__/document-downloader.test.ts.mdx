## High-level description
This code contains a unit test for a document downloader functionality, specifically testing the ability to extract base64-encoded content from an XML document. The test is currently skipped and intended to be run locally, not in CI/CD environments.

## Symbols

### `describe.skip("document-downloader", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is a Jest test suite for the "document-downloader" functionality. The `skip` method is used to prevent this test suite from running in automated test environments.

### `it("should remove base64 from xml", async () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is a single test case within the "document-downloader" suite, focusing on extracting base64 content from an XML document.

#### Internal Logic
1. Define a sample XML string containing a base64-encoded PDF document.
2. Create a new DOMParser instance.
3. Parse the XML string into a DOM document.
4. Locate the "nonXMLBody" element in the document.
5. Find the "text" element within the "nonXMLBody".
6. Extract the text content (base64-encoded data) from the "text" element.
7. Assert that the extracted content matches the expected value "abc123".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| xmldom | Provides the DOMParser for parsing XML strings into DOM documents |

## Error Handling
The test uses optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators to handle potential null or undefined values when accessing DOM elements and their properties.

## TODOs
The test suite is marked with `skip`, indicating that it should not be run in CI/CD environments. This suggests that there might be a TODO to either remove the `skip` or implement a way to run this test locally only.

## Performance Considerations
Parsing XML documents can be computationally expensive for large documents. However, as this is a test case with a small XML sample, performance is not a significant concern here.
