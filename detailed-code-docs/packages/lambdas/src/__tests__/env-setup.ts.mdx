title: "env-setup.ts"

## High-level description
This code sets up the environment for testing by loading environment variables from `.env` and `.env.test` files. It ensures that the correct environment variables are loaded regardless of the current working directory, accommodating both local development and CI/CD pipeline scenarios.

## Symbols

### `cwd`
#### Description
Retrieves the current working directory of the Node.js process.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cwd | string | The current working directory path |

### `paths`
#### Description
Constructs an array of path segments to locate the `.env.test` file. It adapts the path based on whether the current working directory already includes "packages" or not.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| paths | string[] | An array of path segments to locate the `.env.test` file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts with the current working directory (`cwd`).
2. If `cwd` doesn't include "packages", it adds ["packages", "lambdas"] to the path array.

### `dotenv.config()`
#### Description
Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

#### Internal Logic
1. First call: Attempts to load variables from a `.env` file in the current working directory.
2. Second call: Loads variables from `.env.test` file using the constructed path.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | For loading environment variables from `.env` files |
| path | For resolving file paths |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| path | string | N/A | The path to the `.env.test` file, constructed using `path.resolve()` and the `paths` array |

## Side Effects
- Modifies `process.env` by loading environment variables from `.env` and `.env.test` files.

## Notes
- The code is designed to work correctly whether run from the root of the project or from within the `packages/lambdas` directory.
- The comment "Keep dotenv import and config before everything else" suggests that this file should be imported early in the application to ensure environment variables are set before other modules are loaded.
