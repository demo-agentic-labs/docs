## High-level description
This code is a unit test for the `cleanUpPayload` function from the `sqs-to-converter` module. It specifically tests the scenario where the input XML doesn't contain any "UNK" or "nullFlavor" elements, ensuring that the original XML is returned unchanged in this case.

## References
The test file references the `cleanUpPayload` function from "../sqs-to-converter/cleanup".

## Symbols

### `describe("sqs-to-converter")`
#### Description
This is the outer describe block that groups all tests related to the `sqs-to-converter` module.

### `describe("cleanUpPayload")`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on tests specifically for the `cleanUpPayload` function.

### `it("returns original xml when no UNK and no nullFlavor")`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `cleanUpPayload` function returns the original XML unchanged when there are no "UNK" or "nullFlavor" elements present.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Define a sample XML string without any "UNK" or "nullFlavor" elements.
2. Act: Call the `cleanUpPayload` function with the sample XML.
3. Assert: Check that the returned result is exactly the same as the input XML.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the Jest testing framework, as evidenced by the use of `describe`, `it`, and `expect` functions.

## Related Code Analysis
The related code snippet (packages/lambdas/src/sqs-to-converter/cleanup.ts) provides insight into the `cleanUpPayload` function being tested:

1. `cleanUpPayload` function:
   - Takes a raw payload string as input.
   - Applies two cleanup operations: `removeCDUNK` and `removeNullFlavor`.
   - Returns the cleaned-up payload.

2. `removeCDUNK` function:
   - Replaces occurrences of `xsi:type="CD UNK"` with `xsi:type="CD"`.

3. `removeNullFlavor` function:
   - Replaces `&lt;id&gt;` elements with `nullFlavor` attribute with `&lt;id extension="1" root="1"/&gt;`.

The test case in the target file specifically checks the scenario where neither of these cleanup operations are needed, ensuring that the function doesn't modify XML that doesn't require changes.
