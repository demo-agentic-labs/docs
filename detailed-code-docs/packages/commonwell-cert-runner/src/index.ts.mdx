## High-level description
This code is the main entry point for a CommonWell certification runner tool. It sets up the necessary configurations, initializes CommonWell API clients for different organizations, and executes a series of certification test cases for various CommonWell operations such as organization management, person management, patient management, link management, and document operations.

## Code Structure
The main function initializes CommonWell API clients for different organizations (main, sandbox, and member) using configuration from environment variables. It then sequentially calls functions to run through different certification test cases, each focusing on a specific aspect of CommonWell operations.

## Symbols

### `program`
#### Description
A Command object from the commander library used to define and parse command-line options for the certification runner tool.

### `main()`
#### Description
The main function that orchestrates the execution of the CommonWell certification test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses command-line arguments
2. Loads environment variables from a specified file
3. Initializes CommonWell API clients for different organizations
4. Sets up query metadata
5. Sequentially executes various certification test case functions

### `metriportBanner()`
#### Description
A function that returns a string containing an ASCII art banner for Metriport.
