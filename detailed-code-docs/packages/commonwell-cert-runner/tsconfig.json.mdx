title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for the CommonWell certification runner package. It defines compiler options and project settings to ensure strict type-checking, enable specific features, and configure the compilation process for the TypeScript code in this project.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with two main sections: "compilerOptions" and file inclusion/exclusion patterns.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object contains various TypeScript compiler options that control how the code is compiled and type-checked.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set to enable strict type-checking, support modern JavaScript features, and configure output settings. Some notable options include:

1. Extending from "@tsconfig/recommended/tsconfig.json" for base settings.
2. Setting the target to "es2020" for modern JavaScript support.
3. Enabling source maps and declaration files generation.
4. Activating decorator metadata and experimental decorators.
5. Incorporating strict type-checking options from "@tsconfig/strictest".
6. Configuring output directory to "./dist".
7. Disabling some strict checks (noUncheckedIndexedAccess and noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature) due to project-specific considerations.

### include
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Includes all files in the "./src" directory.

### exclude
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Excludes the "dist" and "node_modules" directories, as well as any files in "__tests__" directories.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tsconfig/recommended | Provides base TypeScript configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| target | string | "es2020" | Specifies the ECMAScript target version |
| sourceMap | boolean | true | Generates corresponding .map files |
| declaration | boolean | true | Generates corresponding .d.ts files |
| declarationMap | boolean | true | Generates sourcemaps for .d.ts files |
| outDir | string | "./dist" | Specifies the output directory for compiled files |

## TODOs
1. Issue #340: Enable noUncheckedIndexedAccess once the necessary fixes are implemented.
2. Issue #340: Consider enabling noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature in the future, depending on the package's impact.
