## High-level description
This file (.eslintrc.js) is an ESLint configuration file for the CommonWell certification runner project. It sets up the linting rules and parser for TypeScript files in the project, ensuring code quality and consistency.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single configuration object that defines the ESLint settings for the project.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported by the file. It defines the ESLint settings for the project, including extensions, parser, plugins, and root configuration.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object includes the following key settings:
1. `extends`: An array of ESLint configurations to extend from, including recommended rules, TypeScript-specific rules, and Prettier compatibility.
2. `parser`: Specifies the TypeScript parser for ESLint.
3. `plugins`: Includes the TypeScript ESLint plugin.
4. `root`: Set to true, indicating this is the root configuration file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @typescript-eslint/parser | Parser for TypeScript files |
| @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin | Plugin for TypeScript-specific linting rules |
| eslint-config-prettier | Configuration to disable ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier |

Note: These dependencies are inferred from the configuration and are likely defined in the project's package.json file.

## Configuration
The ESLint configuration extends from three base configurations:
| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| eslint:recommended | ESLint's recommended ruleset |
| plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended | Recommended TypeScript-specific rules |
| prettier | Prettier compatibility configuration |

The configuration uses the @typescript-eslint/parser for parsing TypeScript files and includes the @typescript-eslint plugin for additional TypeScript-specific linting rules.

The `root: true` setting indicates that this is the root configuration file, preventing ESLint from searching for configuration files in parent directories.

This configuration ensures that the CommonWell certification runner project follows best practices for JavaScript and TypeScript development, maintains consistent code style, and avoids conflicts with the Prettier code formatter.
