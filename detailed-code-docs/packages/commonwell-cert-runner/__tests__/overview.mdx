## High-level description
This file contains a unit test for the `commonwellCertRunner` module. It imports the module, asserts that its default export returns the expected string, and logs a success message if the test passes.

## Symbols

### `commonwellSdk()`
#### Description
This is the default export of the `commonwellCertRunner` module being tested.

#### Inputs
None explicitly shown in the test.

#### Outputs
Expected to return the string `'Hello from commonwellCertRunner'`.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses `assert.strictEqual()` to compare the output of `commonwellSdk()` with the expected string.

## Side Effects
The test logs "commonwellCertRunner tests passed" to the console if the assertion passes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `..` | Imports the `commonwellCertRunner` module |

## TODOs
There are no TODOs in this file.

Note: This test file is very basic and only checks for a single, simple functionality. It doesn't provide comprehensive coverage of the `commonwellCertRunner` module's features or potential edge cases. Depending on the actual functionality of the module, more extensive testing might be beneficial.
