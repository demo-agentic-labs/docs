title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.ref.json`) extends the base configuration and sets up specific compiler options for the `core` package. It's designed to be used as a reference in a project with multiple packages, enabling TypeScript's project references feature.

## Code Structure
The configuration file extends the base `tsconfig.json` and adds specific settings for the `core` package.

## References
This file is referenced by the root `tsconfig.json` file in the project's references array.

### Configuration Object
#### Description
The main configuration object that specifies TypeScript compiler options and file inclusion for the `core` package.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration.
2. Specifies files to include in the compilation.
3. Sets compiler options specific to this package.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./tsconfig.json | Base TypeScript configuration that this file extends |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "./tsconfig.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array | ["src/**/*"] | Defines which files to include in the compilation |
| compilerOptions.composite | boolean | true | Enables TypeScript's project references feature |

## Performance Considerations
The use of the `composite` option in the compiler options enables TypeScript's project references feature. This can significantly improve build times in large projects by allowing incremental compilation and better editor support.

## Additional Notes
1. This configuration is specifically tailored for the `core` package within a larger project structure.
2. The `composite` option is crucial for enabling TypeScript's project references, which is useful in monorepo setups or projects with multiple interdependent packages.
3. The `include` array specifies that all files under the `src` directory should be included in the compilation.
4. This file is referenced in the root `tsconfig.json`, indicating that it's part of a larger project structure using TypeScript's project references feature.
5. The base `tsconfig.json` includes additional compiler options like `noErrorTruncation` and `skipLibCheck`, which are inherited by this configuration.
