## High-level description
This code implements a deduplication process for FHIR Procedure resources. It groups similar procedures based on their codes and dates, combines duplicate entries, and manages references to ensure consistency across the dataset.

## Code Structure
The main function `deduplicateProcedures` uses `groupSameProcedures` to identify and combine duplicate procedures. The `extractCodes` function is used to parse coding information from the procedures. These functions work together to create a deduplicated set of procedures and maintain a map of reference replacements.

## Symbols

### `deduplicateProcedures`
#### Description
This function takes an array of Procedure resources and returns deduplicated procedures along with a map for reference replacements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| procedures | Procedure[] | An array of FHIR Procedure resources |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| combinedProcedures | Procedure[] | Deduplicated array of Procedure resources |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | Map of original references to replacement references |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSameProcedures` to identify and combine duplicate procedures
2. Returns the combined procedures and reference replacement map

### `groupSameProcedures`
#### Description
This function groups similar procedures based on their codes (CPT, LOINC, or SNOMED) and dates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| procedures | Procedure[] | An array of FHIR Procedure resources |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| proceduresMap | Map&lt;string, Procedure&gt; | Map of deduplicated procedures |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | Map of original references to replacement references |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the procedures
2. Extracts the date and relevant codes (CPT, LOINC, or SNOMED)
3. Creates a key based on the date and code
4. Uses `fillMaps` function to combine duplicate procedures and update the reference replacement map
5. Applies special modifications to remove non-standard codes and assign the most descriptive status

### `extractCodes`
#### Description
This function extracts CPT, LOINC, and SNOMED codes from a CodeableConcept.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| concept | CodeableConcept \| undefined | The CodeableConcept to extract codes from |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cptCode | string \| undefined | Extracted CPT code |
| loincCode | string \| undefined | Extracted LOINC code |
| snomedCode | string \| undefined | Extracted SNOMED code |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the coding array in the CodeableConcept
2. Identifies the system for each coding (CPT, LOINC, or SNOMED)
3. Extracts and returns the corresponding codes

## Dependencies
The code relies on several imported functions and constants from other modules, including `combineResources`, `fillMaps`, `getPerformedDateFromResource`, and `pickMostDescriptiveStatus` from the shared deduplication utilities.

## Performance Considerations
The deduplication process involves iterating through all procedures and comparing them based on dates and codes. For large datasets, this could potentially be a performance-intensive operation.
