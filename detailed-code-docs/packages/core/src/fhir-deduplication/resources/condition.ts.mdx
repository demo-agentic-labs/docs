## High-level description
This code implements a deduplication function for FHIR Condition resources. It groups similar conditions based on their medical codes (ICD-10 or SNOMED) and dates, combining duplicate entries into a single, more comprehensive record.

## Code Structure
The main function `deduplicateConditions` uses `groupSameConditions` to organize conditions into maps based on their codes. It then combines these grouped conditions using the `combineResources` function from a shared utility module. The `extractCodes` helper function is used to parse the coding information from each condition.

## Symbols

### `deduplicateConditions`
#### Description
This function is the main entry point for deduplicating an array of Condition resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditions | Condition[] | An array of FHIR Condition resources to be deduplicated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| combinedConditions | Condition[] | An array of deduplicated Condition resources |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | A map of reference replacements for updating related resources |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSameConditions` to organize conditions into maps based on their codes
2. Uses `combineResources` to merge the grouped conditions
3. Returns the combined conditions and a reference replacement map

### `groupSameConditions`
#### Description
This function groups similar conditions based on their medical codes and dates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditions | Condition[] | An array of FHIR Condition resources to be grouped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snomedMap | Map&lt;string, Condition&gt; | A map of conditions grouped by SNOMED codes |
| icd10Map | Map&lt;string, Condition&gt; | A map of conditions grouped by ICD-10 codes |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | A map of reference replacements for updating related resources |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each condition
2. Extracts the date and medical codes (SNOMED and ICD-10) from the condition
3. Creates a composite key using the code and date
4. Fills the appropriate map (SNOMED or ICD-10) using the `fillMaps` utility function
5. Applies a special modification to remove non-SNOMED and non-ICD-10 codes from the combined condition

### `extractCodes`
#### Description
This helper function extracts SNOMED and ICD-10 codes from a CodeableConcept.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| concept | CodeableConcept \| undefined | The CodeableConcept to extract codes from |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snomedCode | string \| undefined | The extracted SNOMED code |
| icd10Code | string \| undefined | The extracted ICD-10 code |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the coding array in the CodeableConcept
2. Checks the system of each coding
3. Extracts the SNOMED and ICD-10 codes if present

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| ../../util/constants | Imports constants for SNOMED and ICD-10 code systems |
| ../shared | Imports utility functions for combining and manipulating FHIR resources |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the type safety provided by TypeScript and assumes that the input Condition resources are well-formed.

## Performance Considerations
The deduplication process involves iterating through all conditions and potentially combining them. For large datasets, this could become computationally expensive. Consider implementing pagination or batch processing for very large sets of conditions.
