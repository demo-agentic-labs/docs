## High-level description
This code implements a deduplication process for Practitioner resources in a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) system. It groups similar practitioners based on their names and addresses, and combines them into a single resource, creating a map for reference replacements.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main functions: `deduplicatePractitioners` and `groupSamePractitioners`. The `deduplicatePractitioners` function uses `groupSamePractitioners` to perform the actual grouping and then combines the resources using a shared `combineResources` function.

## References
- `@medplum/fhirtypes`: Provides the `Practitioner` type definition.
- `../../mpi/normalize-address`: Provides the `normalizeAddress` function.
- `../shared`: Provides the `combineResources` and `fillMaps` functions.

## Symbols

### `deduplicatePractitioners`
#### Description
This function takes an array of Practitioner resources and returns deduplicated practitioners along with a reference replacement map.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| practitioners | Practitioner[] | An array of Practitioner resources to be deduplicated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| combinedPractitioners | Practitioner[] | An array of deduplicated Practitioner resources |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | A map for replacing references to deduplicated practitioners |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSamePractitioners` to group similar practitioners.
2. Uses `combineResources` to merge the grouped practitioners.
3. Returns the combined practitioners and the reference replacement map.

### `groupSamePractitioners`
#### Description
This function groups similar practitioners based on their names and normalized addresses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| practitioners | Practitioner[] | An array of Practitioner resources to be grouped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| practitionersMap | Map&lt;string, Practitioner&gt; | A map of grouped practitioners |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | A map for replacing references to grouped practitioners |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each practitioner in the input array.
2. For each practitioner with a name and address:
   a. Normalizes the addresses using `normalizeAddress`.
   b. Creates a key using the name and first normalized address.
   c. Uses `fillMaps` to add the practitioner to the maps.
3. Returns the practitionersMap and refReplacementMap.

## TODOs
- Fix the issue with multiple different doctor names on the same Practitioner resource on the FHIR converter prior to going into more depth here.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses `Map` data structures for efficient lookup and storage of grouped practitioners. The normalization of addresses may have some performance impact, especially for large datasets.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides FHIR type definitions |
| ../../mpi/normalize-address | Provides address normalization functionality |
| ../shared | Provides shared utility functions for resource combination and map filling |
