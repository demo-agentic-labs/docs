## High-level description
This code implements a deduplication process for FHIR Organization resources. It groups similar organizations based on their name and normalized address, and combines them into a single representative organization.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main functions: `deduplicateOrganizations` and `groupSameOrganizations`. The former uses the latter to perform the actual deduplication process.

## References
This code references:
- `@medplum/fhirtypes` for FHIR type definitions
- `../../mpi/normalize-address` for address normalization
- `../shared` for utility functions used in deduplication

## Symbols

### `deduplicateOrganizations`
#### Description
This function takes an array of Organization resources and returns deduplicated organizations along with a reference replacement map.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organizations | Organization[] | Array of Organization resources to deduplicate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| combinedOrganizations | Organization[] | Array of deduplicated Organization resources |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | Map of original references to their replacements |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSameOrganizations` to group similar organizations
2. Uses `combineResources` to merge the grouped organizations
3. Returns the combined organizations and the reference replacement map

### `groupSameOrganizations`
#### Description
This function groups similar organizations based on their name and normalized address.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organizations | Organization[] | Array of Organization resources to group |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organizationsMap | Map&lt;string, Organization&gt; | Map of grouped organizations |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | Map of original references to their replacements |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each organization
2. Creates a key based on the organization's name and first normalized address
3. Uses `fillMaps` to populate the organizationsMap and refReplacementMap
4. Returns the populated maps

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides FHIR type definitions |
| ../../mpi/normalize-address | Normalizes address data |
| ../shared | Provides utility functions for deduplication |

## Performance Considerations
The deduplication process involves iterating through all organizations and creating string keys, which may impact performance for large datasets. The use of Map data structures helps optimize lookup operations.
