## High-level description
This code implements a deduplication mechanism for FHIR Location resources. It groups and combines similar locations based on their names and normalized addresses, creating a single representative location for each unique combination.

## Code Structure
The main functions `deduplicateLocations` and `groupSameLocations` work together to process an array of Location resources. `groupSameLocations` creates a map of unique locations, while `deduplicateLocations` uses this map to produce a final array of combined locations and a reference replacement map.

## Symbols

### `deduplicateLocations`
#### Description
This function takes an array of Location resources and returns deduplicated locations along with a reference replacement map.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| locations | Location[] | An array of FHIR Location resources to be deduplicated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| combinedLocations | Location[] | An array of deduplicated Location resources |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | A map for replacing references to deduplicated locations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSameLocations` to get a map of unique locations and a reference replacement map.
2. Uses `combineResources` to convert the map of unique locations into an array.
3. Returns the combined locations and the reference replacement map.

### `groupSameLocations`
#### Description
This function groups Location resources based on their names and normalized addresses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| locations | Location[] | An array of FHIR Location resources to be grouped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| locationsMap | Map&lt;string, Location&gt; | A map of unique locations keyed by a JSON string of name and normalized address |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | A map for replacing references to grouped locations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes empty maps for unique locations and reference replacements.
2. Iterates through each location in the input array.
3. For each location with a name and address:
   a. Normalizes the address using `normalizeAddress`.
   b. Creates a key by stringifying the name and normalized address.
   c. Uses `fillMaps` to add the location to the maps, combining duplicates.
4. Returns the maps of unique locations and reference replacements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| ../../mpi/normalize-address | Provides the `normalizeAddress` function for standardizing addresses |
| ../shared | Provides utility functions like `combineResources` and `fillMaps` for resource deduplication |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the input data is valid and that the imported functions work correctly.

## Performance Considerations
The performance of this code depends on the number of input locations. The use of maps for grouping and deduplication provides efficient lookup and combination of similar locations.
