## High-level description
This code defines functions for deduplicating and grouping Encounter resources in a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) context. It provides functionality to combine similar encounters based on their date and status, while maintaining a reference replacement map for tracking merged resources.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are:
1. `encounterStatus`: A const array of possible Encounter statuses.
2. `statusRanking`: An object mapping Encounter statuses to numerical rankings.
3. `deduplicateEncounters`: The main function for deduplicating an array of Encounters.
4. `groupSameEncounters`: A helper function that groups similar Encounters based on their date.

These symbols work together to provide a comprehensive deduplication process for Encounter resources.

## Symbols

### `deduplicateEncounters`
#### Description
This function takes an array of Encounter resources and returns an object containing the combined (deduplicated) encounters and a reference replacement map.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| encounters | Encounter[] | An array of Encounter resources to be deduplicated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| combinedEncounters | Encounter[] | An array of deduplicated Encounter resources |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | A map of original references to their replacements |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSameEncounters` to group similar encounters.
2. Uses the `combineResources` function (imported from "../shared") to combine the grouped encounters.
3. Returns the combined encounters and the reference replacement map.

### `groupSameEncounters`
#### Description
This function groups similar Encounters based on their date.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| encounters | Encounter[] | An array of Encounter resources to be grouped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| encountersMap | Map&lt;string, Encounter&gt; | A map of grouped Encounters |
| refReplacementMap | Map&lt;string, string[]&gt; | A map of original references to their replacements |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes empty maps for grouped encounters and reference replacements.
2. Defines an `assignMostDescriptiveStatus` function to determine the most descriptive status between two encounters.
3. Iterates through the input encounters:
   - Extracts the date from each encounter.
   - Creates a key based on the date.
   - Uses the `fillMaps` function (imported from "../shared") to populate the maps, applying the `assignMostDescriptiveStatus` function when combining encounters.
4. Returns the populated maps.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| ../shared | Imports utility functions for resource combination and map filling |

## Performance Considerations
The deduplication process involves iterating through all input encounters and potentially comparing them with existing grouped encounters. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of input encounters. However, the actual performance may vary depending on the size of the input and the number of duplicates found.
