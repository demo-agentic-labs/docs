## High-level description
This directory contains the core functionality for deduplicating FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data. It implements a set of algorithms and utility functions to process various types of FHIR resources, such as conditions, allergies, medications, observations, and more. The main goal is to remove duplicates and combine similar entries to create a more concise and accurate representation of medical data.

## What does it do?
The FHIR deduplication process performs the following main tasks:

1. Analyzes input FHIR Bundles containing various resource types.
2. Groups similar resources based on specific criteria relevant to each resource type (e.g., substance for allergies, codes for conditions, dates for encounters).
3. Combines duplicate or similar resources into single, more comprehensive records.
4. Updates references throughout the bundle to reflect deduplicated resources.
5. Handles special cases and edge conditions specific to each resource type.
6. Preserves important information from each source while removing redundancies.
7. Manages status information for resources like medication statements, selecting the most descriptive status when combining records.

This process helps clean and consolidate medical data, making it more consistent and easier to work with in healthcare information systems. It improves data quality by reducing redundancy and ensuring that the most up-to-date and comprehensive information is retained.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the deduplication process is the `deduplicateFhir` function in the `deduplicate-fhir.ts` file. This function orchestrates the entire deduplication process for a FHIR Bundle. It uses various helper functions and resource-specific deduplication functions to process different types of FHIR resources.

The workflow typically follows these steps:
1. The `deduplicateFhir` function receives a FHIR Bundle as input.
2. It extracts different resource types from the bundle.
3. Each resource type is processed using specific deduplication functions (e.g., `groupSameConditions`, `groupSameAllergies`).
4. References are updated throughout the bundle to reflect deduplicated resources.
5. The deduplicated entries are combined into a new bundle, which is returned as the output.

## Key Files
1. `deduplicate-fhir.ts`: Contains the main `deduplicateFhir` function and orchestrates the overall deduplication process.

2. `shared.ts`: Provides utility functions used across different resource types, such as `combineTwoResources`, `deepMerge`, and `pickMostDescriptiveStatus`.

3. `resources/` directory: Contains resource-specific deduplication functions:
   - `allergy-intolerance.ts`: Deduplicates AllergyIntolerance resources.
   - `condition.ts`: Deduplicates Condition resources.
   - `diagnostic-report.ts`: Deduplicates DiagnosticReport resources.
   - `encounter.ts`: Deduplicates Encounter resources.
   - `immunization.ts`: Deduplicates Immunization resources.
   - `medication-administration.ts`: Deduplicates MedicationAdministration resources.
   - `medication-request.ts`: Deduplicates MedicationRequest resources.
   - `medication-statement.ts`: Deduplicates MedicationStatement resources.
   - `medication.ts`: Deduplicates Medication resources.
   - `observation-shared.ts`: Provides utility functions for Observation resources.
   - `observation-social.ts`: Deduplicates social observations.
   - `observation.ts`: Deduplicates general Observation resources.
   - `organization.ts`: Deduplicates Organization resources.
   - `practitioner.ts`: Deduplicates Practitioner resources.
   - `procedure.ts`: Deduplicates Procedure resources.

4. `__tests__/` directory: Contains comprehensive unit tests for all deduplication functions, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the deduplication process.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies used in this directory are:

1. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources, ensuring type safety when working with FHIR data.
2. dayjs: Used for date manipulation and formatting, crucial for handling date-based deduplication logic.
3. lodash: Utilized for various utility functions, particularly for deep cloning and merging objects.
4. @faker-js/faker: Used in tests to generate random data for testing purposes.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the code uses various constants and types specific to each resource type. These are typically defined at the top of each file or imported from shared utility modules. For example:

```typescript
const statusRanking: Record&lt;MedicationStatementStatus, number&gt; = {
  'entered-in-error': 0,
  stopped: 1,
  'on-hold': 2,
  completed: 3,
  'not-taken': 4,
  active: 5,
  intended: 6,
  unknown: 7,
};
```

These configurations help in determining the most descriptive status when combining resources and in handling specific aspects of each resource type during the deduplication process.

The deduplication logic can be customized for each resource type by modifying the corresponding file in the `resources/` directory. This modular approach allows for easy maintenance and extension of the deduplication process for different FHIR resource types.
