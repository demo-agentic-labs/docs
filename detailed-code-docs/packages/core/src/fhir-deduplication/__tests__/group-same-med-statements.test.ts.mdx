## High-level description
This code contains unit tests for the `groupSameMedStatements` function, which is responsible for grouping and deduplicating medication statements based on their medication reference and date. The tests verify that the function correctly groups duplicate statements and chooses the most descriptive status when combining statements.

## Code Structure
The test file imports necessary dependencies and defines helper functions and variables used across multiple tests. It then uses Jest's `describe` and `it` blocks to organize and run the tests.

## References
- `groupSameMedStatements` function from "../resources/medication-statement"
- `makeMedicationStatement` function from "./examples/medication-related"

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
This function sets up the test environment before each test case is run. It generates unique IDs and creates medication statement objects for use in the tests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generate unique UUIDs for medication statement IDs.
2. Create medication statement objects using the `makeMedicationStatement` function with the generated IDs.

### `describe("groupSameMedStatements", ...)`
#### Description
This describe block groups tests related to the `groupSameMedStatements` function.

### `it("correctly groups duplicate medStatements based on medRef and date", ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `groupSameMedStatements` function correctly groups duplicate medication statements.

#### Internal Logic
1. Call `groupSameMedStatements` with two medication statements.
2. Check that the resulting `medStatementsMap` has a size of 1, indicating that the duplicate statements were grouped together.

### `it("chooses the most descriptive status", ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `groupSameMedStatements` function selects the most descriptive status when combining medication statements.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set different statuses for the two medication statements ("unknown" and "intended").
2. Call `groupSameMedStatements` with the two medication statements.
3. Check that the resulting combined medication statement has the status "intended", which is considered more descriptive than "unknown".

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on Jest's built-in assertion functions to catch and report any failures in the test cases.

## Performance Considerations
The tests in this file are designed to be lightweight and fast-running unit tests. They do not involve any heavy computations or large datasets, so performance is not a significant concern in this context.
