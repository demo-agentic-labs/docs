## High-level description
This file contains example data structures for allergy-related information used in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) implementations. It defines various manifestations, substances, and a "no known allergies" indicator, which are likely used for testing or as reference data in the allergy deduplication process.

## Symbols

### `unknownManifestation`
#### Description
Represents an unknown manifestation of an allergy using the HL7 ValueSet for unknown values.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| unknownManifestation | Array&lt;CodeableConcept&gt; | An array containing a single CodeableConcept representing an unknown manifestation |

### `manifestationAnaphylactic`
#### Description
Represents an anaphylactic reaction manifestation using SNOMED CT coding.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| manifestationAnaphylactic | Array&lt;CodeableConcept&gt; | An array containing a single CodeableConcept representing an anaphylactic reaction |

### `manifestationSkinEruption`
#### Description
Represents a skin eruption manifestation using SNOMED CT coding.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| manifestationSkinEruption | Array&lt;CodeableConcept&gt; | An array containing a single CodeableConcept representing a skin eruption |

### `substanceNsaid`
#### Description
Represents a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) substance using SNOMED CT coding.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| substanceNsaid | CodeableConcept | A CodeableConcept representing an NSAID substance |

### `substanceCashew`
#### Description
Represents a cashew nut allergenic extract substance using RxNorm coding.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| substanceCashew | CodeableConcept | A CodeableConcept representing a cashew nut allergenic extract |

### `noKnownAllergiesSubstance`
#### Description
Represents a "No Known Allergies" indicator using a custom coding system.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| noKnownAllergiesSubstance | CodeableConcept | A CodeableConcept representing the absence of known allergies |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly import any external libraries, but it uses structures that are likely defined in the FHIR type definitions (e.g., CodeableConcept, Coding).
