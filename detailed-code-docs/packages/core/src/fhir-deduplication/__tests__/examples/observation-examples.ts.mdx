## High-level description
This file defines constant objects representing FHIR coding systems for tobacco use and exposure. It includes SNOMED CT and LOINC codes for tobacco-related concepts, which are likely used in FHIR Observation resources for smoking status and tobacco use assessment.

## Symbols

### `snomedCodeTobacco`
#### Description
Defines a SNOMED CT code for "Tobacco use and exposure".

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snomedCodeTobacco | Object | An object containing a coding array with SNOMED CT code for tobacco use and exposure |

### `loincCodeTobacco`
#### Description
Defines a LOINC code for "Smokeless tobacco status".

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| loincCodeTobacco | Object | An object containing a coding array with LOINC code for smokeless tobacco status |

### `valueConceptTobacco`
#### Description
Defines a SNOMED CT code for "Smokeless tobacco non-user".

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| valueConceptTobacco | Object | An object containing a coding array with SNOMED CT code for smokeless tobacco non-user |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FHIR | These constants are structured according to FHIR specifications for coding systems |

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API itself, these constants can be used in FHIR Observation resources. Here's an example of how they might be used:

| Field | Usage | Description |
|:------|:------|:------------|
| Observation.code | `snomedCodeTobacco` or `loincCodeTobacco` | Identifies the type of observation (tobacco use or smokeless tobacco status) |
| Observation.valueCodeableConcept | `valueConceptTobacco` | Represents the result of the observation (smokeless tobacco non-user) |

Note: This file appears to be part of a test suite or example set, as indicated by its location in a `__tests__/examples/` directory. These constants are likely used to create or validate FHIR Observation resources related to tobacco use in test scenarios.
