## High-level description
This file defines a constant `cvxCodeFlu` that represents a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) coding for a specific type of influenza vaccine. It provides a structured representation of the vaccine's code, system, and display information.

### `cvxCodeFlu`
#### Description
`cvxCodeFlu` is a constant object that represents the coding for an influenza vaccine using the CVX (Vaccine Administered) coding system. It follows the FHIR CodeableConcept structure, which is commonly used to represent coded concepts in healthcare.

#### Inputs
This constant does not have inputs as it is a predefined object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cvxCodeFlu | Object | An object representing the FHIR CodeableConcept for a specific influenza vaccine |

#### Internal Logic
The `cvxCodeFlu` object consists of two main properties:

1. `coding`: An array containing a single object with the following properties:
   - `system`: A string URL identifying the coding system (CVX in this case)
   - `code`: A string representing the specific code for the vaccine ("150")
   - `display`: A human-readable string describing the vaccine

2. `text`: A string providing a human-readable description of the vaccine

This structure allows for both machine-readable (through the `coding` array) and human-readable (through the `text` property) representation of the vaccine information.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Configuration
This file does not contain any configuration options.

## API/Interface Reference
| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| cvxCodeFlu.coding | Array | Contains a single object with system, code, and display properties |
| cvxCodeFlu.coding[0].system | String | The URL of the coding system (CVX) |
| cvxCodeFlu.coding[0].code | String | The specific code for the influenza vaccine |
| cvxCodeFlu.coding[0].display | String | Human-readable description of the vaccine |
| cvxCodeFlu.text | String | Overall human-readable description of the vaccine |

This constant can be imported and used in other parts of the application where FHIR-compliant vaccine coding information is needed, particularly for influenza vaccines.
