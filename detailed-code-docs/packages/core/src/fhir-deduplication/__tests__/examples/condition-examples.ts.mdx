## High-level description
This file defines a set of constant objects representing various medical codes and date-time values. These constants are likely used for testing or as example data in a healthcare-related application that deals with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards, particularly for conditions like macular degeneration and retinal occlusion.

## Symbols

### `snomedCodeMd`
#### Description
Represents a SNOMED CT code for macular degeneration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snomedCodeMd | object | An object containing the SNOMED CT system and code for macular degeneration |

### `icd10CodeMd`
#### Description
Represents an ICD-10-CM code for macular degeneration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| icd10CodeMd | object | An object containing the ICD-10-CM system, code, and display name for macular degeneration |

### `otherCodeSystemMd`
#### Description
Represents a code from another terminology system (IMO) for macular degeneration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| otherCodeSystemMd | object | An object containing the IMO system, code, and display name for macular degeneration |

### `snomedCodeAo`
#### Description
Represents a SNOMED CT code for arterial occlusion.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snomedCodeAo | object | An object containing the SNOMED CT system and code for arterial occlusion |

### `icd10CodeAo`
#### Description
Represents an ICD-10-CM code for transient arterial occlusion of retina.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| icd10CodeAo | object | An object containing the ICD-10-CM system, code, and display name for transient arterial occlusion of retina |

### `dateTime`
#### Description
Represents a date-time object with a start time.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dateTime | object | An object containing a start date-time value |

### `dateTime2`
#### Description
Represents another date-time object with a different start time.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dateTime2 | object | An object containing a start date-time value |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly import any external libraries or modules. However, it's worth noting that the structure of the objects suggests they are designed to work with FHIR-related systems or libraries.

## Notes
1. The file name suggests that these constants are examples used in tests related to FHIR deduplication, specifically for condition resources.
2. The codes are represented using standard terminologies in healthcare:
   - SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms)
   - ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification)
   - IMO (Intelligent Medical Objects)
3. The date-time values are represented in ISO 8601 format, which is commonly used in FHIR resources.
4. The constants are grouped logically:
   - `Md` suffix likely stands for Macular Degeneration
   - `Ao` suffix likely stands for Arterial Occlusion
5. This file provides a set of consistent, reusable test data that can be imported into various test scenarios, ensuring consistency across tests related to condition resources and deduplication logic.
