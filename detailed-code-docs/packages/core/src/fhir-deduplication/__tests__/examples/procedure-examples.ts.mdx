## High-level description
This file defines example medical coding objects for HIV testing procedures. It exports two constants: `cptCodeAb` and `loincCodeAb`, which represent CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) and LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) codes for HIV antigen and antibody tests, respectively.

## Symbols

### `cptCodeAb`
#### Description
This constant represents a CPT code object for an HIV-1/2 antigen and antibodies laboratory test.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cptCodeAb | Object | An object containing coding information for the CPT code and a text description |

#### Internal Logic
The object contains a `coding` array with a single element representing the CPT code, and a `text` field with a human-readable description of the procedure.

___

### `loincCodeAb`
#### Description
This constant represents a LOINC code object for an HIV-1/2 antigen and antibodies test.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| loincCodeAb | Object | An object containing coding information for the LOINC code and a text description |

#### Internal Logic
The object contains a `coding` array with a single element representing the LOINC code, including the system, code, and display fields. It also has a `text` field with a human-readable description of the test.
