## High-level description
This directory contains example data and utility functions for creating mock FHIR resources related to various medical concepts. These examples are likely used for testing and development purposes in a FHIR-based healthcare application, particularly focusing on deduplication processes.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory provide:
1. Example data structures for allergies, conditions, immunizations, medications, observations, and procedures.
2. Utility functions to create mock FHIR resources such as MedicationAdministration, MedicationRequest, and MedicationStatement.
3. Predefined coding objects for various medical terminologies like SNOMED CT, ICD-10-CM, RxNorm, NDC, CPT, and LOINC.

These examples and utilities allow developers to easily create realistic test data for FHIR resources, ensuring consistency across tests related to resource deduplication and other FHIR-based operations.

## Key Files

### allergy-examples.ts
Defines example data structures for allergy-related information, including manifestations, substances, and a "no known allergies" indicator.

### condition-examples.ts
Provides constant objects representing medical codes for conditions like macular degeneration and retinal occlusion, using SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM coding systems.

### immunization-examples.ts
Defines a constant `cvxCodeFlu` representing a FHIR coding for a specific type of influenza vaccine using the CVX coding system.

### medication-examples.ts
Contains example medication codes for Acetaminophen and Prednisone in different coding systems (RxNorm, NDC, and SNOMED CT).

### medication-related.ts
Provides utility functions for creating mock FHIR resources related to medications, including MedicationAdministration, MedicationRequest, and MedicationStatement.

### observation-examples.ts
Defines constant objects representing FHIR coding systems for tobacco use and exposure, including SNOMED CT and LOINC codes.

### procedure-examples.ts
Exports constants representing CPT and LOINC codes for HIV antigen and antibody tests.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies used across these files are:

1. @faker-js/faker: Used to generate random UUIDs for resource IDs and document extensions.
2. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources.

These examples are structured according to FHIR specifications and use standard medical terminology systems such as SNOMED CT, ICD-10-CM, RxNorm, NDC, CPT, and LOINC.

## Configuration
While these files don't contain explicit configuration options, they do include some customizations:

1. A custom extension `https://public.metriport.com/fhir/StructureDefinition/doc-id-extension.json` is added to all resources created by the utility functions in `medication-related.ts`, suggesting this is a Metriport-specific extension for document identification.

2. Some SNOMED CT codes in `medication-examples.ts` are placeholders and need to be replaced with actual codes, as indicated by TODO comments.

In conclusion, this directory serves as a comprehensive set of example data and utilities for working with FHIR resources in a testing environment. It provides a foundation for creating realistic, consistent test data across various medical domains, which is crucial for developing and testing FHIR-based applications, particularly those involving resource deduplication processes.
