title: "group-same-conditions.test.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSameConditions` function, which is responsible for grouping and deduplicating FHIR Condition resources based on their SNOMED and ICD-10 codes, as well as their onset dates. The tests cover various scenarios to ensure the function behaves correctly under different conditions.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured using Jest's testing framework. It includes a `beforeEach` block to set up common test data and a `describe` block containing multiple test cases for the `groupSameConditions` function.

## References
The code references the following external modules and functions:
- `@faker-js/faker` for generating random UUIDs
- `@medplum/fhirtypes` for the Condition type
- `makeCondition` from a local utility file
- `groupSameConditions` from the target implementation file
- Various constants and example data from local files

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
Sets up common test data before each test case runs.

#### Internal Logic
- Generates unique UUIDs for two condition IDs
- Creates two condition objects using the `makeCondition` function

### `describe("groupSameConditions", ...)`
#### Description
Contains all the test cases for the `groupSameConditions` function.

### Test Cases
Each test case is implemented as an `it` block. Here's a summary of the test cases:

1. Correctly groups duplicate conditions based on SNOMED codes
2. Correctly groups duplicate conditions based on ICD-10 codes
3. Does not group duplicate conditions that don't have overlapping codes
4. Removes conditions that have neither SNOMED nor ICD-10 codes
5. Does not group conditions with different SNOMED codes
6. Does not group conditions with different ICD-10 codes
7. Does not group conditions with different onset dates
8. Strips away codes that aren't SNOMED or ICD-10

#### Internal Logic
Each test case follows this general structure:
1. Arrange: Set up the condition objects with specific codes and onset dates
2. Act: Call the `groupSameConditions` function with the prepared conditions
3. Assert: Check the resulting maps (snomedMap and icd10Map) for expected sizes or contents

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Generating random UUIDs for test data |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Providing the Condition type definition |
| makeCondition | Utility function for creating test Condition objects |
| groupSameConditions | The function being tested |

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on Jest's built-in assertion functions to catch and report any unexpected behavior.

## Performance Considerations
The tests in this file are not specifically designed to test performance. However, they do cover various scenarios that could impact the performance of the `groupSameConditions` function, such as handling different code types and filtering out irrelevant codes.
