## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `combineTwoResources` function, which is used to merge two FHIR Condition resources. The tests verify various aspects of the merging process, including ID preservation, property combination, and extension handling.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses Jest and is organized into a single `describe` block with multiple `it` blocks for different test cases. It utilizes the `faker` library to generate random UUIDs and the `makeCondition` function to create test Condition resources.

## References
- `combineTwoResources` function from "../shared"
- `makeCondition` function from "../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-condition"
- FHIR Condition type from "@medplum/fhirtypes"

## Symbols

### `beforeAll` function
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating two Condition resources with unique IDs and properties.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates two unique UUIDs using `faker.string.uuid()`.
2. Creates two Condition resources using `makeCondition` function, with different IDs and onset periods.

### `describe("groupSameConditions", ...)` block
#### Description
Contains all the test cases for the `combineTwoResources` function.

### Test: "keeps the id of the first condition"
#### Description
Verifies that the combined condition retains the ID of the first condition.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `combineTwoResources` with `condition` and `condition2`.
2. Checks if the resulting condition's ID matches the first condition's ID.

### Test: "keeps unique properties from both conditions"
#### Description
Ensures that unique properties from both conditions are preserved in the combined condition.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds unique properties to `condition` and `condition2`.
2. Combines the conditions using `combineTwoResources`.
3. Checks if the combined condition contains both unique properties.

### Test: "combines array properties"
#### Description
Verifies that array properties (like `code.coding`) are correctly combined without duplication.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds different coding arrays to `condition` and `condition2`.
2. Combines the conditions using `combineTwoResources`.
3. Checks if the combined condition contains both coding entries.

### Test: "does not duplicate array entries"
#### Description
Ensures that identical array entries are not duplicated in the combined condition.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds identical coding arrays to both conditions.
2. Combines the conditions using `combineTwoResources`.
3. Checks if the combined condition's coding array has only one entry.

### Test: "contains references to combined conditions inside the extension"
#### Description
Verifies that the combined condition includes references to the original conditions in its extension.

#### Internal Logic
1. Combines the conditions using `combineTwoResources`.
2. Checks if the combined condition's extension array contains a reference to the second condition's ID.

### Test: "does not combine extensions when it's disabled"
#### Description
Ensures that extensions are not combined when the `isExtensionIncluded` flag is set to false.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds different extensions to both conditions.
2. Combines the conditions using `combineTwoResources` with `isExtensionIncluded` set to false.
3. Checks if the combined condition's extension property is undefined.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Generating random UUIDs for test data |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Providing FHIR type definitions |
| Jest | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The tests do not explicitly handle errors but rely on Jest's assertion mechanisms to catch any unexpected behavior.
