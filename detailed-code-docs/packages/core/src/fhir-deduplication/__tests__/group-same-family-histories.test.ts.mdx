## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` function, which is responsible for grouping family member histories based on certain criteria. The tests verify the function's behavior in different scenarios, such as handling duplicate entries, different birth dates, and different relationships.

## Symbols

### `describe("groupSameFamilyMemberHistories", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify the function's behavior under different conditions.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This function runs before each test case, setting up the necessary test data. It creates two `FamilyMemberHistory` objects with unique IDs using the `makeFamilyMemberHistory` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates two unique UUIDs using `faker.string.uuid()`.
2. Creates two `FamilyMemberHistory` objects using the `makeFamilyMemberHistory` function, each with a unique ID.

### `it("correctly groups duplicate famMemHistorys based on relationship", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` function correctly groups duplicate family member histories based on their relationship.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` with an array containing two family member history objects.
2. Checks that the resulting `famMemberHistsMap` has a size of 1, indicating that the two histories were grouped together.

### `it("does not group if dob is different or missing in one of the resources", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case checks that the `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` function does not group family member histories if their birth dates are different or missing in one of the resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `bornDate` of `famMemHistory` to "1930-01-01".
2. Calls `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` and checks that the resulting map has a size of 2.
3. Sets different birth dates for both family member histories.
4. Calls `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` again and checks that the resulting map still has a size of 2.

### `it("does not group people with the same name if the relationship is different", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` function does not group family member histories if they have different relationships, even if they have the same name and birth date.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `relationship` of `famMemHistory2` to `naturalBrotherCode`.
2. Sets the same `bornDate` for both family member histories.
3. Calls `groupSameFamilyMemberHistories` and checks that the resulting map has a size of 2.
