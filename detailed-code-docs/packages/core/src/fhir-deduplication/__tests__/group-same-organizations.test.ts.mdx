## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSameOrganizations` function, which is responsible for grouping and deduplicating organizations based on their names and addresses. The tests verify various scenarios of organization grouping, including duplicate detection, handling of different addresses and names, and removal of organizations without names or addresses.

## Symbols

### `describe("groupSameOrganizations", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `groupSameOrganizations` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify the function's behavior under different scenarios.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This function sets up the test environment before each test case. It creates two organization objects with unique IDs but the same name ("Planet Express").

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates two unique UUIDs for organization IDs.
2. Creates two organization objects using the `makeOrganization` function with the generated IDs and the name "Planet Express".

### `it("correctly groups duplicate organizations based on names and addresses", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function correctly groups organizations with the same name and address.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assigns the same address to both organizations.
2. Calls `groupSameOrganizations` with both organizations.
3. Expects the resulting `organizationsMap` to have a size of 1, indicating that the organizations were grouped together.

### `it("does not group organizations with different addresses", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function does not group organizations with the same name but different addresses.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assigns different addresses to the two organizations.
2. Calls `groupSameOrganizations` with both organizations.
3. Expects the resulting `organizationsMap` to have a size of 2, indicating that the organizations were not grouped together.

### `it("does not group organizations with different names", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function does not group organizations with different names, even if they have the same address.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assigns the same address to both organizations.
2. Changes the name of the second organization.
3. Calls `groupSameOrganizations` with both organizations.
4. Expects the resulting `organizationsMap` to have a size of 2, indicating that the organizations were not grouped together.

### `it("removes organizations without names", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function removes organizations without names from the grouping process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assigns the same address to both organizations.
2. Removes the name from the second organization.
3. Calls `groupSameOrganizations` with both organizations.
4. Expects the resulting `organizationsMap` to have a size of 1, indicating that only the organization with a name was included.

### `it("removes organizations without addresses", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function removes organizations without addresses from the grouping process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assigns an address only to the first organization.
2. Calls `groupSameOrganizations` with both organizations.
3. Expects the resulting `organizationsMap` to have a size of 1, indicating that only the organization with an address was included.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random UUIDs for organization IDs |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides the `Organization` type definition |
| ../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-encounter | Imports the `exampleAddress` for testing |
| ../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-organization | Imports the `makeOrganization` function for creating test organizations |
| ../resources/organization | Imports the `groupSameOrganizations` function being tested |

This test file ensures that the `groupSameOrganizations` function correctly handles various scenarios of organization grouping and deduplication, providing confidence in its behavior when used in the main application.
