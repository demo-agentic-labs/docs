## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSameProcedures` function, which is responsible for grouping and deduplicating medical procedures based on their codes and dates. The tests verify the function's behavior in various scenarios, including handling duplicate procedures, different dates, different codes, and preserving specific coding systems while removing others.

## Symbols

### `describe("groupSameProcedures", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `groupSameProcedures` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify the function's behavior under different conditions.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This function runs before each test case, setting up the necessary test data by creating two procedure objects with unique IDs using the `makeProcedure` function and the `faker` library.

### `it("correctly groups duplicate procedures based on cvx codes and dates", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function correctly groups duplicate procedures when they have the same CPT code and date.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the same date and CPT code for both procedures.
2. Calls `groupSameProcedures` with the two procedures.
3. Expects the resulting `proceduresMap` to have a size of 1, indicating that the procedures were grouped together.

### `it("does not group procedures with different dates", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function does not group procedures with the same code but different dates.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets different dates for the two procedures but the same CPT code.
2. Calls `groupSameProcedures` with the two procedures.
3. Expects the resulting `proceduresMap` to have a size of 2, indicating that the procedures were not grouped together.

### `it("does not group procedures with different codes", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function does not group procedures with the same date but different codes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the same date for both procedures but different codes (CPT and LOINC).
2. Calls `groupSameProcedures` with the two procedures.
3. Expects the resulting `proceduresMap` to have a size of 2, indicating that the procedures were not grouped together.

### `it("preserves cpt and loinc codes, but removes epic codes", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function preserves CPT and LOINC codes while removing other coding systems (e.g., Epic codes) during the grouping process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the same date for both procedures.
2. Assigns multiple coding systems (CPT, LOINC, and Epic) to the first procedure and only CPT to the second procedure.
3. Calls `groupSameProcedures` with the two procedures.
4. Expects the resulting `proceduresMap` to have a size of 1, indicating that the procedures were grouped together.
5. Verifies that the master procedure in the map contains only CPT and LOINC codes, with the Epic code removed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random UUIDs for test data |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| ../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-procedure | Provides a utility function to create test procedure objects |
| ../resources/procedure | Contains the `groupSameProcedures` function being tested |
| ./examples/condition-examples | Provides example date constants for testing |
| ./examples/procedure-examples | Provides example procedure code constants for testing |

## References
The test file references the following external symbols:
- `groupSameProcedures` from "../resources/procedure"
- `makeProcedure` from "../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-procedure"
- `dateTime`, `dateTime2` from "./examples/condition-examples"
- `cptCodeAb`, `loincCodeAb` from "./examples/procedure-examples"

These references are crucial for understanding the test setup and the function being tested.
