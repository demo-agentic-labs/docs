## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSameMedications` function, which is responsible for grouping duplicate medications based on their RxNorm, NDC, or SNOMED codes. The tests ensure that the function correctly groups medications, handles different code types, and manages edge cases.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into a single `describe` block for the `groupSameMedications` function, containing multiple test cases (`it` blocks) that cover various scenarios and edge cases.

## References
- `groupSameMedications` function from "../resources/medication"
- `makeMedication` function from "../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-medication"
- Various code examples from "./examples/medication-examples"

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
This function sets up the test environment before each test case by creating unique medication IDs and medication objects.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generate unique UUIDs for `medicationId` and `medicationId2`.
2. Create `medication` and `medication2` objects using the `makeMedication` function with the generated IDs.

### `describe("groupSameMedications", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `groupSameMedications` function, containing multiple test cases.

### Test Cases

#### "correctly groups duplicate medications based on rxnorm codes"
#### Description
Verifies that medications with the same RxNorm code are grouped correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set RxNorm codes for both medications.
2. Call `groupSameMedications` with the medications.
3. Assert that only the RxNorm map has entries.

#### "correctly groups duplicate medications based on ndc codes"
#### Description
Verifies that medications with the same NDC code are grouped correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set NDC codes for both medications.
2. Call `groupSameMedications` with the medications.
3. Assert that only the NDC map has entries.

#### "correctly groups duplicate medications based on snomed codes"
#### Description
Verifies that medications with the same SNOMED code are grouped correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set SNOMED codes for both medications.
2. Call `groupSameMedications` with the medications.
3. Assert that only the SNOMED map has entries.

#### "does not group duplicate medications that don't have overlapping codes"
#### Description
Ensures that medications with different code types are not grouped together.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set different code types for each medication.
2. Call `groupSameMedications` with the medications.
3. Assert that both code type maps have entries.

#### "removes medications that have neither of the expected codes"
#### Description
Verifies that medications without recognized code types are not included in the grouping.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set a recognized code for one medication and an unrecognized code for the other.
2. Call `groupSameMedications` with the medications.
3. Assert that only the recognized code map has an entry.

#### "strips out irrelevant codes"
#### Description
Ensures that only relevant codes are kept when grouping medications.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set medications with both relevant and irrelevant codes.
2. Call `groupSameMedications` with the medications.
3. Assert that only relevant codes are present in the grouped medication.

#### "does not group medications with different codes"
#### Description
Verifies that medications with different codes of the same type are not grouped together.

#### Internal Logic
1. Test for RxNorm, NDC, and SNOMED code types separately.
2. Set different codes of the same type for each medication.
3. Call `groupSameMedications` for each code type.
4. Assert that the respective map has two entries for each case.

#### "does not save the extensions for the medications"
#### Description
Ensures that extensions are not preserved when grouping medications.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set the same RxNorm code for both medications.
2. Call `groupSameMedications` with the medications.
3. Assert that the combined medication does not have an extension property.
