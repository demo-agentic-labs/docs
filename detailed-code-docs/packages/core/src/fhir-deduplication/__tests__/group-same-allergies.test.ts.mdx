---

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `extractFromReactions` and `groupSameAllergies` functions from the allergy-intolerance module. These tests verify the correct handling of allergy manifestations, substances, and grouping of similar allergies.

## Code Structure
The file is structured into two main test suites: one for `extractFromReactions` and another for `groupSameAllergies`. Each suite contains multiple test cases that cover different scenarios and edge cases for these functions.

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
This function sets up the test environment before each test case by creating unique IDs and allergy objects.

#### Internal Logic
- Generates unique UUIDs for `allergyId` and `allergyId2`
- Creates `allergy` and `allergy2` objects using the `makeAllergy` function

### `describe("extractFromReactions", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite focuses on the `extractFromReactions` function, which processes allergy reactions to extract valid manifestations and substances.

#### Internal Logic
Contains multiple test cases that check:
- Removal of unknown manifestations
- Handling of known manifestations
- Removal of unknown substances
- Handling of known substances
- Correct processing of reaction arrays with mixed known and unknown elements

### `describe("groupSameAllergies", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite focuses on the `groupSameAllergies` function, which groups similar allergies together.

#### Internal Logic
Contains multiple test cases that check:
- Grouping of allergies with the same reactions
- Grouping of allergies with the same substance but different manifestations
- Handling of allergies with different substances
- Removal of allergies with unknown substances and manifestations
- Handling of "no known allergies" cases

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Generating fake data for testing |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| makeAllergy | Helper function to create allergy objects |
| extractFromReactions, groupSameAllergies | Functions being tested |
| Various allergy examples | Test data for different scenarios |

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's assertion functions to check for expected outcomes. If any assertion fails, the test will fail and provide information about the mismatch between expected and actual results.
