## High-level description
This code is a unit test suite for the `pickMostDescriptiveStatus` function, which is part of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) deduplication system. The tests verify that the function correctly selects the more descriptive status between two given medication statement statuses based on a predefined ranking.

## References
The test file references the following symbols from other parts of the codebase:
- `MedicationStatementStatus` and `statusRanking` from "../resources/medication-statement"
- `pickMostDescriptiveStatus` from "../shared"

## Symbols

### `describe("pickMostDescriptiveStatus", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `pickMostDescriptiveStatus` function. It contains a single test case with multiple assertions.

### `it("correctly picks the more descriptive status", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `pickMostDescriptiveStatus` function correctly selects the more descriptive status between two given medication statement statuses.

#### Internal Logic
The test case follows this pattern:
1. Arrange: Set up two status variables (`status1` and `status2`) with different `MedicationStatementStatus` values.
2. Act: Call the `pickMostDescriptiveStatus` function with `statusRanking` and the two status variables.
3. Assert: Use `expect().toEqual()` to check if the returned status matches the expected more descriptive status.

This pattern is repeated five times with different combinations of statuses:
1. "unknown" vs "stopped" (expects "stopped")
2. "stopped" vs "unknown" (expects "stopped")
3. "active" vs "stopped" (expects "stopped")
4. "active" vs "completed" (expects "completed")
5. "intended" vs "active" (expects "active")

## Dependencies
The test file depends on a testing framework, likely Jest, as evidenced by the use of `describe`, `it`, and `expect` functions.

## Notes
1. The test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the `pickMostDescriptiveStatus` function works correctly for different status combinations.
2. The `statusRanking` imported from "../resources/medication-statement" is used to determine the relative descriptiveness of statuses.
3. The test file doesn't explicitly test all possible combinations of statuses but focuses on key scenarios that demonstrate the function's behavior.
4. The `MedicationStatementStatus` type is used to ensure type safety when assigning status values.

This test suite plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability of the status selection logic in the FHIR deduplication system, particularly for medication statements.
