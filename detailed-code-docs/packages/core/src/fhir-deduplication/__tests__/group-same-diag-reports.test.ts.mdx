## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSameDiagnosticReports` function, which is responsible for grouping duplicate diagnostic reports based on certain criteria. The tests verify the function's behavior in various scenarios, including different combinations of report attributes and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `describe("groupSameDiagnosticReports", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `groupSameDiagnosticReports` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify the function's behavior under different conditions.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This function runs before each test case, setting up the necessary test data. It creates two diagnostic reports with unique IDs using the `makeDiagnosticReport` function.

### `it("correctly groups duplicate diagReports based on effectiveDateTime and data presence", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function correctly groups duplicate diagnostic reports when they have the same `effectiveDateTime` and contain different data (`result` and `presentedForm`).

#### Internal Logic
1. Set the same `effectiveDateTime` for both reports
2. Add `result` to one report and `presentedForm` to the other
3. Call `groupSameDiagnosticReports` with both reports
4. Assert that the resulting `diagReportsMap` has a size of 1, indicating the reports were grouped

### `it("does not group duplicate diagReports if effectiveDateTime is not present", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case checks that the function does not group reports when `effectiveDateTime` is missing, even if other data is present.

#### Internal Logic
1. Add `presentedForm` to both reports (without setting `effectiveDateTime`)
2. Call `groupSameDiagnosticReports` with both reports
3. Assert that the resulting `diagReportsMap` has a size of 0, indicating no grouping occurred

### `it("does not group duplicate diagReports if effectiveDateTime are different", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function does not group reports when they have different `effectiveDateTime` values, even if they contain different types of data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set different `effectiveDateTime` values for each report
2. Add `presentedForm` to one report and `result` to the other
3. Call `groupSameDiagnosticReports` with both reports
4. Assert that the resulting `diagReportsMap` has a size of 2, indicating no grouping occurred

### `it("discards codes that don't come from loinc", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case checks that the function discards coding systems that are not from LOINC when grouping reports.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set the same `effectiveDateTime` for both reports
2. Add `presentedForm` to both reports
3. Set `code` for one report with multiple codings, including non-LOINC codes
4. Call `groupSameDiagnosticReports` with both reports
5. Assert that the resulting `diagReportsMap` has a size of 1
6. Verify that the grouped report only contains LOINC codes in its `code.coding` array

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms, as it relies on Jest's built-in assertion and error reporting capabilities.
