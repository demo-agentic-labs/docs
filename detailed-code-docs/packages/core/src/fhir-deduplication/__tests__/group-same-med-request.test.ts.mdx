title: "group-same-med-request.test.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code is a unit test file for the `groupSameMedRequests` function from the medication-request module. It tests the functionality of grouping duplicate medication requests based on medication reference and date.

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
This is a Jest setup function that runs before each test. It initializes test data by creating two medication request objects with unique IDs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates two unique UUIDs using `faker.string.uuid()`.
2. Creates two medication request objects using the `makeMedicationRequest` function, passing the generated UUIDs as IDs.

### `describe("groupSameMedStatements")`
#### Description
This is a Jest test suite that contains tests for the `groupSameMedRequests` function.

### `it("correctly groups duplicate medRequests based on medRef and date")`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `groupSameMedRequests` function correctly groups duplicate medication requests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSameMedRequests` with an array containing two medication request objects.
2. Extracts the `medRequestsMap` from the result.
3. Asserts that the size of `medRequestsMap` is 1, indicating that the two medication requests were grouped together.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate fake data (UUIDs) for testing |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| ../resources/medication-request | Contains the `groupSameMedRequests` function being tested |
| ./examples/medication-related | Contains the `makeMedicationRequest` helper function |

## References
The test file references the following external symbols:
- `groupSameMedRequests` from "../resources/medication-request"
- `makeMedicationRequest` from "./examples/medication-related"

## Notes
1. The test suite currently contains only one test case, which checks if duplicate medication requests are correctly grouped.
2. The test relies on the `makeMedicationRequest` function to create test data, but the implementation of this function is not provided in the given code snippets.
3. The test assumes that the `groupSameMedRequests` function groups medication requests based on medication reference and date, as mentioned in the test description.
4. The actual implementation of `groupSameMedRequests` is provided in the related code snippet, which shows that it indeed uses medication reference and date as part of the grouping key.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this test file. However, considering the implementation in the related code snippet, there are some TODOs that might affect future tests:
1. Deduplicating Practitioners prior to MedicationRequests.
2. Including `medRequest.dosage` in the grouping key when it starts being mapped in the FHIR converter.

These TODOs in the implementation might lead to additional test cases in the future to cover these scenarios.
