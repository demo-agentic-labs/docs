title: "group-same-immunizations.test.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSameImmunizations` function from the immunization deduplication module. The tests verify the function's ability to correctly group duplicate immunizations based on CVX codes and dates, handle different scenarios, and remove immunizations with undefined or unknown dates.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured using Jest's testing framework. It includes a `beforeEach` block to set up common test data and a `describe` block containing multiple test cases for the `groupSameImmunizations` function.

## References
- `groupSameImmunizations` function from "../resources/immunization"
- `makeImmunization` function from "../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-immunization"
- `Immunization` type from "@medplum/fhirtypes"
- `cvxCodeFlu`, `dateTime`, and `dateTime2` from example files

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
Sets up common test data before each test case runs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates unique IDs for two immunizations using `faker.string.uuid()`.
2. Creates two immunization objects using the `makeImmunization` function.

### `describe("groupSameImmunizations")`
#### Description
Contains multiple test cases for the `groupSameImmunizations` function.

### Test: "correctly groups duplicate immunizations based on cvx codes and dates"
#### Description
Verifies that the function correctly groups immunizations with the same CVX code and date.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the same occurrence date and CVX code for both immunizations.
2. Calls `groupSameImmunizations` with the two immunizations.
3. Expects the resulting `immunizationsCvxMap` to have a size of 1, indicating successful grouping.

### Test: "does not group immunizations with different dates"
#### Description
Ensures that immunizations with different dates are not grouped together.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets different occurrence dates for the two immunizations.
2. Sets the same CVX code for both immunizations.
3. Calls `groupSameImmunizations` with the two immunizations.
4. Expects the resulting `immunizationsCvxMap` to have a size of 2, indicating no grouping.

### Test: "removes immunizations with undefined dates"
#### Description
Verifies that immunizations with undefined dates are removed from the grouping.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets CVX codes for both immunizations but leaves dates undefined.
2. Calls `groupSameImmunizations` with the two immunizations.
3. Expects the resulting `immunizationsCvxMap` to have a size of 0, indicating removal of both immunizations.

### Test: "removes immunizations with unknown date"
#### Description
Ensures that immunizations with "unknown" dates are removed from the grouping.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets a valid date for one immunization and "unknown" for the other.
2. Sets the same CVX code for both immunizations.
3. Calls `groupSameImmunizations` with the two immunizations.
4. Expects the resulting `immunizationsCvxMap` to have a size of 1, indicating removal of the immunization with an unknown date.

## Dependencies
