## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSamePractitioners` function, which is responsible for grouping and deduplicating practitioner records based on their names and addresses. The tests verify various scenarios of grouping and filtering practitioners.

## Symbols

### `describe("groupSamePractitioners", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `groupSamePractitioners` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify the function's behavior under different scenarios.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This function sets up the test environment before each test case. It creates two practitioner objects with unique IDs and the same name.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generate unique IDs for two practitioners using `faker.string.uuid()`.
2. Create two practitioner objects using `makePractitioner` function with the generated IDs and a predefined name (`practitionerNameZoidberg`).

### `it("correctly groups duplicate practitioners based on names and addresses", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function correctly groups practitioners with the same name and address.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assign the same address (`exampleAddress`) to both practitioners.
2. Call `groupSamePractitioners` with an array containing both practitioners.
3. Assert that the resulting `practitionersMap` has a size of 1, indicating that the practitioners were grouped together.

### `it("does not group practitioners with different addresses", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case ensures that practitioners with different addresses are not grouped together.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assign `exampleAddress` to the first practitioner.
2. Assign a modified version of `exampleAddress` with a different city to the second practitioner.
3. Call `groupSamePractitioners` with an array containing both practitioners.
4. Assert that the resulting `practitionersMap` has a size of 2, indicating that the practitioners were not grouped together.

### `it("does not group practitioners with different names", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that practitioners with different names are not grouped together, even if they have the same address.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assign the same address to both practitioners.
2. Modify the name of the second practitioner to have a different family name.
3. Call `groupSamePractitioners` with an array containing both practitioners.
4. Assert that the resulting `practitionersMap` has a size of 2, indicating that the practitioners were not grouped together.

### `it("removes practitioners without names", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case checks if practitioners without names are removed from the grouping process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assign the same address to both practitioners.
2. Remove the name property from the second practitioner.
3. Call `groupSamePractitioners` with an array containing both practitioners.
4. Assert that the resulting `practitionersMap` has a size of 1, indicating that the practitioner without a name was removed.

### `it("removes practitioners without addresses", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that practitioners without addresses are removed from the grouping process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assign an address only to the first practitioner.
2. Call `groupSamePractitioners` with an array containing both practitioners.
3. Assert that the resulting `practitionersMap` has a size of 1, indicating that the practitioner without an address was removed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random UUIDs for practitioner IDs |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides the Practitioner type definition |
| ../resources/practitioner | Contains the `groupSamePractitioners` function being tested |
| ../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-encounter | Provides utility functions and data for creating test practitioners |

## Notes
- The tests use Jest as the testing framework, as evidenced by the use of `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, and `expect` functions.
- The tests focus on verifying the grouping logic based on names and addresses, as well as the removal of practitioners with missing required information.
- The `groupSamePractitioners` function returns an object with a `practitionersMap` property, which is used to determine the number of unique practitioners after grouping.
