## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `groupSameEncounters` function, which is responsible for grouping and deduplicating encounter resources in a FHIR-based system. The tests verify various scenarios of encounter grouping, including date-based grouping, field combination, and status handling.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured using Jest's testing framework. It includes a `beforeEach` block to set up common test data and multiple `it` blocks to test different aspects of the `groupSameEncounters` function.

## References
- `groupSameEncounters` function from "../resources/encounter"
- Various helper functions and example data from "../../fhir-to-cda/cda-templates/components/__tests__/make-encounter"

## Symbols

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
Sets up common test data before each test case.

#### Internal Logic
- Generates unique IDs for two encounters
- Creates two encounter objects using the `makeEncounter` function

### `describe("groupSameEncounters")`
#### Description
Groups all test cases related to the `groupSameEncounters` function.

### `it("correctly groups duplicate encounters based on date")`
#### Description
Tests if encounters with the same date are correctly grouped.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the same date for both encounters
2. Calls `groupSameEncounters` with the encounters
3. Checks if the resulting map has only one entry
4. Verifies that the reference replacement map contains the expected entries

### `it("does not group encounters with different dates")`
#### Description
Verifies that encounters with different dates are not grouped together.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets different dates for the two encounters
2. Calls `groupSameEncounters`
3. Checks if the resulting map has two entries

### `it("combines all fields as expected")`
#### Description
Tests if all fields from multiple encounters are combined correctly in the grouped encounter.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the same date for both encounters
2. Adds various fields (type, hospitalization, reasonCode, diagnosis) to the first encounter
3. Calls `groupSameEncounters`
4. Verifies that the resulting grouped encounter contains all the fields from the original encounter

### `it("combines all fields as expected")` (second occurrence)
#### Description
Tests the combination of fields when both encounters have different values for the same fields.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the same date for both encounters
2. Adds different values for various fields to both encounters
3. Calls `groupSameEncounters`
4. Verifies that the resulting grouped encounter contains a combination of fields from both original encounters

### `it("keeps the more informative status")`
#### Description
Tests if the grouping function correctly selects the most informative status when combining encounters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the same date for both encounters
2. Tests three different status combinations
3. For each combination, calls `groupSameEncounters` and verifies that the most informative status is kept

### `it("does not group encounters when dates are missing")`
#### Description
Verifies that encounters without dates are not grouped.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `groupSameEncounters` with encounters that have no dates set
2. Checks if the resulting map is empty

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on Jest's assertion functions to catch and report any unexpected behavior.
