## High-level description
This file defines utility functions for executing asynchronous operations concurrently. The main function, `executeAsynchronously`, allows processing an array of items asynchronously with configurable parallelism, delay, and error handling options.

## Code Structure
The file exports two main types: `ExecuteInChunksOptions` for configuration options and `FunctionType` for the function to be executed asynchronously. The core functionality is provided by the `executeAsynchronously` function, which uses `executeSynchronously` internally to process items in parallel.

## Symbols

### `ExecuteInChunksOptions`
#### Description
An interface defining options for the `executeAsynchronously` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| numberOfParallelExecutions | number | Optional. How many promises should execute at the same time. |
| delay | number | Optional. Explicit delay between runs in milliseconds. |
| maxJitterMillis | number | Optional. Maximum jitter in milliseconds before each run. |
| minJitterMillis | number | Optional. Minimum jitter in milliseconds before each run. |
| keepExecutingOnError | boolean | Optional. Whether to keep executing when an error occurs. |
| log | function | Optional. Where to log. |

### `FunctionType&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
A type definition for the function to be executed asynchronously.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| item | T | The item to be processed. |
| itemIndex | number | The index of the item in the array. |
| promiseIndex | number | The index of the promise processing the item. |
| promiseCount | number | The total amount of promises running in parallel. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the processing is done. |

### `executeAsynchronously&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
The main function that processes an array of items asynchronously.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| collection | T[] | Array of elements to be processed. |
| fn | FunctionType&lt;T&gt; | The function to be executed asynchronously. |
| options | ExecuteInChunksOptions | Additional settings (optional). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;PromiseSettledResult&lt;void&gt;[]&gt; | A promise that resolves with the results of all executions. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates input parameters.
2. Creates a copy of the input array.
3. Determines the number of parallel promises to run.
4. Creates an array of promises, each processing items from the collection.
5. Executes the promises in parallel, with optional error handling.
6. Returns the results of all executions.

### `executeSynchronously&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
An internal function that processes items synchronously for a single promise.

#### Internal Logic
1. Processes items from the shared array one by one.
2. Calls the provided function for each item.
3. Handles errors based on the `keepExecutingOnError` option.
4. Updates the shared index control.

## Dependencies
- `errorToString` from "./error/shared"
- `sleep` from "./sleep"

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling mechanisms, allowing for continued execution on errors if specified in the options. Errors are logged if a logging function is provided.

## Performance Considerations
The code allows for parallel execution of tasks, which can significantly improve performance for I/O-bound operations. The use of jitter can help prevent thundering herd problems in distributed systems.
