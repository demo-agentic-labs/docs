## High-level description
This file serves as an index module for the utility functions in the core package. It exports various utility modules related to concurrency, environment variables, logging, and notifications, making them easily accessible for other parts of the application.

## Code Structure
The file uses ES6 module syntax to export all the contents from four different utility modules: concurrency, env-var, log, and notifications. It also exports these modules as named exports, allowing for both namespace and individual function imports.

## Symbols

### `concurrency`
#### Description
Exports all functions from the "./concurrency" module and also exports the entire module as a namespace.

### `envVar`
#### Description
Exports all functions from the "./env-var" module and also exports the entire module as a namespace.

### `log`
#### Description
Exports all functions from the "./log" module and also exports the entire module as a namespace.

### `notifications`
#### Description
Exports all functions from the "./notifications" module.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./concurrency | Provides concurrency-related utility functions |
| ./env-var | Provides environment variable-related utility functions |
| ./log | Provides logging-related utility functions |
| ./notifications | Provides notification-related utility functions |

## Notes
1. The file uses a combination of `export *` and `export * as` syntax. This allows consumers of this module to either import specific functions or import the entire module as a namespace.
2. The `concurrency`, `envVar`, and `log` modules are exported both as individual functions and as namespaces, while `notifications` is only exported as individual functions.
3. This index file serves as a central point for accessing various utility functions, promoting better organization and easier imports in other parts of the application.
4. The actual implementations of these utility functions are in their respective files, which are included in the related code snippets.
