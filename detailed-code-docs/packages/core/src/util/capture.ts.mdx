## High-level description
This code defines a `Capture` type and an `emptyCapture` object for error and message capturing in a TypeScript environment. It provides a standardized interface for capturing errors and messages, which can be used across different parts of an application for logging and monitoring purposes.

### `Capture`
#### Description
`Capture` is a TypeScript type that defines an interface for capturing errors and messages.

#### Inputs
This type doesn't have inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
This type doesn't have outputs as it's a type definition.

#### Internal Logic
The `Capture` type defines two methods:
1. `error`: For capturing error events.
2. `message`: For capturing message events.

Both methods take similar parameters:
- An error object or a message string.
- An optional `captureContext` of type `Partial&lt;ScopeContext&gt;`.

Both methods return a string, which is typically an event ID.

### `emptyCapture`
#### Description
`emptyCapture` is an object that implements the `Capture` interface with empty functions.

#### Inputs
This object doesn't have inputs as it's a constant.

#### Outputs
This object doesn't have outputs as it's a constant.

#### Internal Logic
`emptyCapture` provides no-op implementations for both `error` and `message` methods, returning an empty string for both.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @sentry/types | Imports the `ScopeContext` type used in the `Capture` interface. |

## Notes
- This code provides a flexible interface for error and message capturing, which can be implemented in various ways (e.g., logging to console, sending to a monitoring service).
- The `emptyCapture` object can be used as a default implementation or for testing purposes where actual capturing is not needed.
- The use of `Partial&lt;ScopeContext&gt;` allows for flexible additional context to be passed with each capture event.

This code serves as a foundation for error and message handling throughout an application, allowing for consistent capture and reporting of events across different modules or services.
