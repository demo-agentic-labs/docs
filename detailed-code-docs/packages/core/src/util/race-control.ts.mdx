## High-level description
This code provides utility functions for controlling and managing race conditions in asynchronous operations. It includes functions to check if a race is complete and to control the duration of an operation, which are useful for implementing timeouts and polling mechanisms.

## Symbols

### `RaceControl`
#### Description
A type definition representing the control mechanism for a race condition.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isRaceInProgress | boolean | Indicates whether the race is currently in progress |

### `checkIfRaceIsComplete`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that repeatedly checks if a race condition is complete, with a configurable sleep interval between checks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isRaceComplete | () =&gt; Promise&lt;boolean&gt; \| boolean | A function that returns whether the race is complete |
| raceControl | RaceControl | The race control object |
| completeMsg | string | The message to return when the race is complete |
| sleepIntervalMS | number | The interval in milliseconds to sleep between checks |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;string&gt; | A promise that resolves to the complete message if the race finishes, or an empty string if the race is interrupted |

#### Internal Logic
1. While the race is in progress (controlled by `raceControl.isRaceInProgress`):
   - Check if the race is complete by calling `isRaceComplete()`
   - If complete, return the `completeMsg`
   - If not complete, sleep for the specified interval
2. If the loop exits (race interrupted), return an empty string

### `controlDuration`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that waits for a specified duration and then returns a message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| durationMS | number | The duration to wait in milliseconds |
| msg | string | The message to return after the duration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;string&gt; | A promise that resolves to the input message after the specified duration |

#### Internal Logic
1. Wait for the specified duration using the `sleep` function
2. Return the input message

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Provides the `sleep` function used for introducing delays |

## References
This utility is used in other parts of the codebase, specifically in the `pollOutboundResults` function in the file `packages/core/src/external/carequality/ihe-gateway/poll-outbound-results.ts`. It's used to implement a polling mechanism with a timeout for querying results from an IHE Gateway.
