## High-level description
This code defines a utility for managing request-specific context using Node.js's AsyncLocalStorage. It provides a foundation for storing and accessing request-specific data, such as request IDs, throughout the asynchronous execution of a request.

## Symbols

### `AsyncLocalStorage`
#### Description
`AsyncLocalStorage` is imported from Node.js's `async_hooks` module. It provides a way to store and retrieve data that is local to the current asynchronous context.

### `LocalStorage`
#### Description
A type alias defining the possible keys for local storage. Currently, it only includes "reqId".

### `reqIdAsyncLocalStorage`
#### Description
An instance of `AsyncLocalStorage&lt;string&gt;` created to store request IDs.

### `getLocalStorage`
#### Description
A function that returns the appropriate `AsyncLocalStorage` instance based on the provided key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _ | LocalStorage | The key to determine which storage to return (currently unused) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| AsyncLocalStorage&lt;string&gt; | AsyncLocalStorage&lt;string&gt; | The AsyncLocalStorage instance for storing request IDs |

#### Internal Logic
The function currently ignores the input parameter and always returns `reqIdAsyncLocalStorage`. The unused parameter is marked with an underscore to indicate it's intentionally unused.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:async_hooks | Provides the AsyncLocalStorage class for managing asynchronous context |

## TODOs
The code includes a comment suggesting future expansion:
"To add more information on the request, like cx/user id, create a new storage and return the correct one based on the param to `getLocalStorage()`."

## Performance Considerations
Using `AsyncLocalStorage` can have a slight performance impact, but it provides a clean way to manage request-specific data without passing context through every function call. It's particularly useful in asynchronous environments where maintaining context can be challenging.

## Notes
1. The code is set up to potentially handle multiple types of local storage (as indicated by the `LocalStorage` type), but currently only implements storage for request IDs.
2. The `getLocalStorage` function is marked with an ESLint disable comment for the unused parameter, indicating that this is intentional and may be used in future implementations.
3. This utility is likely used in a server environment to track request-specific data across asynchronous operations, improving traceability and context management in complex workflows.
