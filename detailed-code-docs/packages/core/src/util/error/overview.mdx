## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions and classes for error handling in the Metriport application. It includes custom error classes, error conversion utilities, and functions for processing asynchronous errors. The code in this directory is primarily focused on providing a standardized way to handle and represent errors throughout the application.

## What does it do?
The error utility functions and classes in this directory serve several purposes:

1. They define custom error types specific to the Metriport application, such as `BadRequestError` and `NotFoundError`, which extend a base `MetriportError` class.

2. They provide functions to convert errors into string representations, both in simple and detailed formats. This is useful for logging and debugging purposes.

3. They offer utilities for handling asynchronous errors, including a function to create error handlers that log and capture errors for monitoring.

4. They implement a retry mechanism for executing functions that may fail, allowing for automatic retries with configurable options.

These utilities help developers handle errors consistently across the application, improve error reporting and debugging, and manage asynchronous operations more effectively.

## Key Files

### metriport-error.ts
This file defines the base `MetriportError` class, which extends the built-in `Error` class. It includes additional properties such as an HTTP status code, a cause, and additional information. This serves as the foundation for other custom error classes in the application.

```typescript
class MetriportError extends Error {
  status: number = httpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR;
  cause?: unknown;
  additionalInfo?: AdditionalInfo;

  constructor(message: string, cause?: unknown, additionalInfo?: AdditionalInfo) {
    super(message);
    this.cause = cause;
    this.additionalInfo = additionalInfo;
  }
}
```

### bad-request.ts
This file defines the `BadRequestError` class, which extends `MetriportError`. It's used specifically for errors related to bad requests, setting the HTTP status code to 400.

```typescript
class BadRequestError extends MetriportError {
  constructor(
    message = "Bad request",
    cause?: unknown,
    additionalInfo?: Record&lt;string, string | number | undefined | null&gt;
  ) {
    super(message, cause, additionalInfo);
    this.status = httpStatus.BAD_REQUEST;
    this.name = this.constructor.name;
  }
}
```

### not-found.ts
This file defines the `NotFoundError` class, which extends `MetriportError`. It's used for errors when a requested resource cannot be found, setting the HTTP status code to 404.

```typescript
class NotFoundError extends MetriportError {
  constructor(
    message = "Could not find the requested resource",
    cause?: unknown,
    additionalInfo?: AdditionalInfo
  ) {
    super(message, cause, additionalInfo);
    this.status = httpStatus.NOT_FOUND;
    this.name = this.constructor.name;
  }
}
```

### shared.ts
This file contains utility functions for error handling, including:

1. `errorToString`: Converts an error object to a string representation.
2. `processAsyncError`: Creates a function to handle asynchronous errors, logging and capturing them for monitoring.
3. `executeWithRetry`: Executes a function with automatic retries on failure.

Here's an example of the `errorToString` function:

```typescript
function errorToString(err: unknown, options?: ErrorToStringOptions): string {
  return options?.detailed ? detailedErrorToString(err) : genericErrorToString(err);
}
```

## Dependencies
The error utilities in this directory rely on the following external dependencies:

1. `http-status`: Provides HTTP status codes as constants, used in the custom error classes.
2. `node:util`: Used for the `inspect` function in error string conversion.

Internal dependencies include:
1. `../log`: For logging utilities.
2. `../notifications`: For error capturing and monitoring.

## Configuration
The error handling utilities in this directory don't rely on specific configuration files or environment variables. However, some functions accept options as parameters to customize their behavior. For example, the `errorToString` function accepts an `ErrorToStringOptions` object to determine whether to generate a detailed or simple error string.

## Notes
1. Many of the classes and functions in this directory are marked as deprecated with `@deprecated` JSDoc comments, suggesting that users should use `@metriport/shared` instead. This indicates that there might be ongoing efforts to consolidate error handling utilities in a shared package.

2. The custom error classes (`MetriportError`, `BadRequestError`, `NotFoundError`) provide a consistent way to represent and handle errors throughout the application, including HTTP status codes and additional contextual information.

3. The `shared.ts` file provides utility functions that can be used across the application for error handling, logging, and retrying operations. These functions enhance the robustness and reliability of the application by providing standardized ways to handle errors and retry failed operations.

4. The error handling utilities in this directory contribute to better debugging and error reporting in the Metriport application, allowing developers to quickly identify and resolve issues.
