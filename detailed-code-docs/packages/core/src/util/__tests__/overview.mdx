## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for various utility functions in the core package of the project. The tests cover a range of functionalities including base64 encoding/decoding, concurrency management, environment variable handling, file downloading, logging, string manipulation, URN processing, and UUID validation.

## What does it do?
The test files in this directory ensure that the utility functions in the core package work correctly under various scenarios. They verify:

1. Base64 encoding and decoding of strings, including empty strings and Unicode characters.
2. Asynchronous execution of functions with configurable concurrency and jitter.
3. Proper handling of environment variables and environment types.
4. File downloading using different methods (stream, memory, direct to file).
5. Logging functionality with various combinations of prefixes, suffixes, and additional parameters.
6. Safe string conversion of different data types.
7. Stripping of URN prefixes from strings.
8. Validation of UUID strings, including those generated by a custom UUID v7 function.

These tests help maintain the reliability and correctness of the core utility functions as the project evolves.

## Key Files
1. `base64.test.ts`: Tests for base64 encoding and decoding functions.
2. `concurrency.test.ts`: Tests for asynchronous execution with configurable concurrency and jitter.
3. `env-var.test.ts`: Tests for environment variable handling and environment type validation.
4. `file-downloader.ts`: Tests for different file downloading methods.
5. `log.test.ts`: Tests for logging functionality with various input combinations.
6. `string.test.ts`: Tests for safe string conversion of different data types.
7. `urn.test.ts`: Tests for stripping URN prefixes from strings.
8. `validate-uuid.test.ts`: Tests for UUID validation, including custom UUID v7 generation.

## Dependencies
The test files use the following main dependencies:
1. Jest: The primary testing framework used across all test files.
2. @faker-js/faker: Used in several test files to generate random test data.
3. Various utility functions from the core package, which are the subjects of these tests.

## Configuration
The tests use Jest's configuration, which is likely defined in a separate Jest configuration file for the project. Some tests, like the file downloader tests, include commented-out setup instructions for creating a local test environment.

The tests make use of Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate the functions being tested and to verify their behavior under controlled conditions. This includes mocking console.log for logging tests and using jest.restoreAllMocks() to reset mocks between tests.
