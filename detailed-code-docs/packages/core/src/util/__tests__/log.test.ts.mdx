## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `log` function from the `../log` module. It tests various scenarios of logging messages with different combinations of prefixes, suffixes, and additional parameters.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses Jest for testing and Faker for generating random test data. It mocks the global `console.log` function to verify the correct output of the `log` function.

## References
- The code under test is imported from `../log`.
- The test suite uses `@faker-js/faker` for generating random test data.

## Symbols

### `describe("log", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `log` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify different aspects of the logging functionality.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite sets up mocks for `console.log` before all tests, resets mocks before each test, and restores all mocks after all tests are complete.

### `it("logs msg without prefix", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `log` function when called without a prefix.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Generate a random message using Faker.
2. Act: Call the `log` function without a prefix and pass the message.
3. Assert: Verify that `console.log` was called with the exact message.

### `it("logs msg with prefix", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `log` function when called with a prefix.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Generate random prefix and message using Faker.
2. Act: Call the `log` function with the prefix and message.
3. Assert: Verify that `console.log` was called with the message prefixed by the prefix in square brackets.

### `it("logs msg with suffix", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `log` function when called with both a prefix and a suffix.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Generate random prefix, suffix, and message using Faker.
2. Act: Call the `log` function with prefix, suffix, and message.
3. Assert: Verify that `console.log` was called with the message prefixed by the prefix in square brackets and followed by the suffix.

### `it("logs msg additional string param", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `log` function when called with an additional string parameter.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Generate random prefix, message, and additional string parameter using Faker.
2. Act: Call the `log` function with prefix, message, and additional parameter.
3. Assert: Verify that `console.log` was called with the prefixed message and the additional parameter.

### `it("logs msg additional number param", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `log` function when called with an additional number parameter.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous test, but uses a random integer as the additional parameter.

### `it("logs msg additional boolean param", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `log` function when called with an additional boolean parameter.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous tests, but uses a random boolean as the additional parameter.

### `it("logs msg additional function param", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `log` function when called with an additional function parameter.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Generate random prefix, message, and function parameter using Faker.
2. Act: Call the `log` function with prefix, message, and function parameter.
3. Assert: Verify that `console.log` was called with the prefixed message and the result of calling the function parameter.

| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random test data |
| jest | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on testing the correct behavior of the `log` function under various input conditions.
