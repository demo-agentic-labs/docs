## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `isValidUuid` function, which is used to validate UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) strings. The tests cover various scenarios including valid UUIDs, invalid UUIDs, and UUIDs generated using the `uuidv7` function.

## Symbols

### `describe("isValidUuid", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `isValidUuid` function. It groups together multiple test cases that verify the behavior of the function under different conditions.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite contains four separate test cases, each focusing on a specific aspect of UUID validation.

### `it("should return false on empty string", ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `isValidUuid` function returns `false` when given an empty string as input.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: No specific arrangement needed
- Act: Call `isValidUuid` with an empty string
- Assert: Expect the result to be `false`

### `it("should recognize valid uuids as such", ...)`
#### Description
This test case checks if the `isValidUuid` function correctly identifies valid UUID strings.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Two valid UUID strings are defined (`validUuid` and `allNumberValidUuid`)
- Act: Call `isValidUuid` with each valid UUID
- Assert: Expect the result to be `true` for both cases

### `it("should recognize invalid uuids as such", ...)`
#### Description
This test case ensures that the `isValidUuid` function correctly identifies invalid UUID strings.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Two invalid UUID strings are defined (`idWithInvalidLength` and `idWithUnexpectedCharacters`)
- Act: Call `isValidUuid` with each invalid UUID
- Assert: Expect the result to be `false` for both cases

### `it("should validate uuids created with uuidv7()", ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies that UUIDs generated using the `uuidv7` function are recognized as valid by the `isValidUuid` function.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: A loop is set up to run 100 times
- Act: For each iteration, generate a new UUID using `uuidv7()` and validate it with `isValidUuid`
- Assert: Expect the result to be `true` for all generated UUIDs

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `isValidUuid` | Function being tested for UUID validation |
| `uuidv7` | Function used to generate UUIDs for testing |

Both `isValidUuid` and `uuidv7` are imported from the "../uuid-v7" module.

## References
The test file references the following external symbols:
- `isValidUuid`: The main function being tested
- `uuidv7`: A function used to generate UUIDs for testing purposes

These symbols are imported from the "../uuid-v7" module, which is likely defined in a separate file within the project.
