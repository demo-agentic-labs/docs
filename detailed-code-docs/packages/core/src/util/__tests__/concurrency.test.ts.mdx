## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `executeAsynchronously` function from the `concurrency.ts` module. The tests cover various scenarios, including error handling, input validation, and the function's behavior in concurrent execution environments.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into two main describe blocks: one for `executeAsynchronously` and another for "threadsafe set operations". Each describe block contains multiple test cases that verify different aspects of the function's behavior.

## References
The code references the following external modules and functions:
- `executeAsynchronously` from "../concurrency"
- `sleep` from "@metriport/shared"
- `faker` from "@faker-js/faker"

## Symbols

### `describe("executeAsynchronously", ...)`
#### Description
This describe block contains multiple test cases for the `executeAsynchronously` function.

#### Internal Logic
The tests cover various scenarios, including:
1. Input validation (minJitter and maxJitter values)
2. Execution behavior with different input parameters
3. Jitter functionality
4. Default behavior

### `it("fails if minJitter is lower than zero", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that the function throws an error when `minJitterMillis` is negative.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Set up a list and a mock function
2. Act: Call `executeAsynchronously` with negative `minJitterMillis`
3. Assert: Expect the function to throw an error

### `it("fails if maxJitter is lower than zero", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that the function throws an error when `maxJitterMillis` is negative.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous test, but with negative `maxJitterMillis`.

### `it("fails if minJitter is higer than maxJitter", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that the function throws an error when `minJitterMillis` is greater than `maxJitterMillis`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Set up a list, a mock function, and jitter values
2. Act: Call `executeAsynchronously` with `minJitterMillis` &gt; `maxJitterMillis`
3. Assert: Expect the function to throw an error

### `it("defaults async runs to to number of items on list", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that the function defaults to running as many parallel executions as there are items in the input list.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a list with 21 items and a mock function
2. Act: Call `executeAsynchronously` without specifying `numberOfParallelExecutions`
3. Assert: Expect the mock function to be called 21 times (once for each item)

### `it("sends correct item ", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that the function passes the correct items to the callback function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a list with 3 items and a mock function
2. Act: Call `executeAsynchronously`
3. Assert: Verify that the mock function is called with the correct items in order

### `it("sends correct index item ", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that the function passes the correct item indices to the callback function.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous test, but checks for correct index values.

### `it("jitters before runs", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that the function applies jitter before each run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Mock `sleep` function and `Math.random`
2. Act: Call `executeAsynchronously` with specific jitter settings
3. Assert: Verify that `sleep` is called with the expected jitter values

### `it("defaults jitter before run to zero", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that the function defaults to zero jitter when not specified.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Mock `sleep` function
2. Act: Call `executeAsynchronously` without specifying jitter
3. Assert: Verify that `sleep` is called with zero jitter

### `describe("threadsafe set operations", ...)`
#### Description
This describe block contains a test case for thread-safe set operations using `executeAsynchronously`.

### `it("should add numbers to a set in a thread-safe manner", ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies that `executeAsynchronously` can be used to perform thread-safe set operations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a set and a list of numbers
2. Act: Use `executeAsynchronously` to add numbers to the set concurrently
3. Assert: Verify that the set contains all expected numbers without duplicates

## TODOs
There is a commented-out test case with a TODO:
```typescript
// TODO fix this test, likely need to build a "shift" function so we can mock it (or mock
// Array.prototype.shift)
```
This test case is intended to verify that the function splits the list and runs it asynchronously, but it's currently not implemented due to mocking difficulties.
