## High-level description
This code sets up the environment for testing by loading environment variables from `.env` and `.env.test` files. It uses the `dotenv` library to load these environment variables and ensures that the correct file paths are used, considering different project structures.

## Symbols

### `cwd`
#### Description
Retrieves the current working directory of the Node.js process.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cwd | string | The current working directory path |

### `paths`
#### Description
Constructs an array of path segments to locate the `.env` and `.env.test` files. It handles different project structures by checking if the current working directory includes "packages".

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| paths | string[] | An array of path segments |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts with the current working directory (`cwd`).
2. If `cwd` doesn't include "packages", it adds ["packages", "core"] to the array.

### `dotenv.config()`
#### Description
Loads environment variables from `.env` and `.env.test` files using the `dotenv` library.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | object | Configuration options for dotenv |
| options.path | string | The path to the .env file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `dotenv.config()` twice:
   - First, to load variables from the `.env` file
   - Second, to load variables from the `.env.test` file
2. Uses `path.resolve()` to construct the full path to each file using the `paths` array

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `process.env` object by loading environment variables from `.env` and `.env.test` files.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Loading environment variables from .env files |
| path | Resolving file paths |

## Notes
- The comment "Keep dotenv import and config before everything else" suggests that this file should be imported early in the application to ensure environment variables are loaded before other modules are initialized.
- The code handles different project structures by adjusting the path based on whether "packages" is in the current working directory.
