## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Carequality integration within the Metriport healthcare interoperability system. It provides functionality for patient discovery, document query, and document retrieval operations, adhering to IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) standards and Carequality implementation guidelines.

## What does it do?
The Carequality integration facilitates secure healthcare information exchange between different healthcare providers and systems. Key functionalities include:

1. Patient Discovery (PD): Allows searching for patient information across different healthcare communities using Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) protocols.
2. Document Query (DQ): Enables querying for available medical documents for a specific patient.
3. Document Retrieval (DR): Facilitates the retrieval of specific medical documents.
4. SAML-based Security: Implements secure communication using SAML assertions and digital signatures.
5. Inbound and Outbound Request Handling: Processes incoming requests and creates outbound requests for patient discovery, document query, and document retrieval.
6. Error Handling: Provides comprehensive error handling and custom error types for various scenarios.
7. Data Validation: Implements robust validation of incoming and outgoing data to ensure compliance with healthcare data standards.
8. Statistics and Monitoring: Generates statistics on XCPD operations and monitors IHE transactions for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this implementation are:

1. `ihe-gateway-v2.ts`: Defines the abstract `IHEGatewayV2` class, which serves as the interface for IHE Gateway V2 operations.
2. `process-inbound-pd.ts`: Handles incoming patient discovery requests.
3. `process-inbound-dq.ts`: Processes inbound document query requests.
4. `process-inbound-dr.ts`: Manages inbound document retrieval requests.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. Inbound requests are received and processed by the respective handlers (PD, DQ, DR).
2. Data is validated and extracted from the incoming requests.
3. Operations are performed (e.g., patient matching, document querying, document retrieval).
4. Responses are constructed and returned, adhering to IHE standards.

## Key Files
1. `shared.ts`: Contains shared constants, types, and utility functions used across the Carequality integration.
2. `create-metadata-xml.ts`: Generates standardized XML metadata for healthcare documents.
3. `get-document-download-url.ts`: Builds document references and generates secure access URLs for documents.
4. `validating-pd.ts`: Validates and extracts patient data from incoming requests.
5. `error.ts`: Defines custom error classes and utility functions for error handling.

## Dependencies
The implementation relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk: Provides types, schemas, and constants for IHE Gateway operations.
2. @metriport/shared: Offers utility functions used across the codebase.
3. aws-sdk: Used for interacting with AWS services, particularly S3 and Lambda.
4. axios: Used for making HTTP requests.
5. zod: Used for schema definition and validation.
6. sequelize: ORM used for database operations, particularly in generating statistics.

## Configuration
The implementation uses various configuration options and environment variables, including:

1. AWS configurations for S3 and Lambda.
2. SAML certificates and keys for secure communication.
3. Database credentials for storing and retrieving patient and document information.
4. Constants like `METRIPORT_HOME_COMMUNITY_ID` for identifying the local community in the Carequality network.
5. Performance tuning settings like `MAX_NUMBER_OF_PARALLEL_XCPD_PROCESSING_REQUESTS`.

These configurations allow for flexibility in deploying the Carequality integration in different environments and connecting to various healthcare communities.

In conclusion, this directory implements a comprehensive Carequality integration for the Metriport system, providing secure and standardized healthcare information exchange capabilities. It handles complex operations such as patient discovery, document query, and document retrieval, while ensuring compliance with IHE standards and Carequality implementation guidelines.
