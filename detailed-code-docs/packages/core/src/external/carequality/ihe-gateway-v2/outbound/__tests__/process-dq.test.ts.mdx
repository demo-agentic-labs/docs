## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `processDqResponse` function, which processes Document Query (DQ) responses in the context of an IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Gateway implementation. The tests cover various scenarios, including successful responses, empty responses, responses with registry errors, and invalid responses.

## Symbols

### `describe("processDqResponse", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `processDqResponse` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify the function's behavior under different scenarios.

### `it("should process the successful DQ response correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `processDqResponse` function correctly processes a successful DQ response containing multiple documents.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads a sample XML file containing a successful DQ response with multiple documents.
2. Calls `processDqResponse` with the sample response and other required parameters.
3. Checks if the processed response contains the expected `documentReference` data.

### `it("should process the empty DQ response correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `processDqResponse` function correctly handles an empty DQ response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads a sample XML file containing an empty DQ response.
2. Calls `processDqResponse` with the sample response and other required parameters.
3. Checks if the processed response contains an `operationOutcome` with the "no-documents-found" code.

### `it("should process the DQ response with registry error correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `processDqResponse` function correctly handles a DQ response containing a registry error.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads a sample XML file containing a DQ response with a registry error.
2. Calls `processDqResponse` with the sample response and other required parameters.
3. Checks if the processed response contains an `operationOutcome` with the "XDSRegistryError" code.

### `it("should process response that is not a string correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `processDqResponse` function correctly handles an invalid response that is not a valid XML string.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a sample invalid response string.
2. Calls `processDqResponse` with the invalid response and other required parameters.
3. Checks if the processed response contains an `operationOutcome` with the `schemaErrorCode`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fs | For reading sample XML files |
| path | For constructing file paths |
| processDqResponse | The main function being tested |
| outboundDqRequest, expectedDqDocumentReference | Constants used in the tests |
| schemaErrorCode | Error code constant for schema validation errors |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, including:
1. Empty responses (no documents found)
2. Registry errors
3. Invalid response format (non-XML string)

These scenarios are handled by checking the `operationOutcome` property of the processed response for specific error codes.
