## High-level description
This code defines a function `sendSignedDrRequest` that sends a signed Document Retrieval (DR) request to a Carequality gateway using SAML authentication and MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) for efficient document transfer. It handles the sending process, error handling, and response processing for document retrieval operations in a healthcare interoperability context.

## Code Structure
The main function `sendSignedDrRequest` uses helper functions like `sendSignedXmlMtom` and `storeDrResponse` to perform its operations. It also defines a type `DrSamlClientResponse` to structure the response data.

## Symbols

### `DrSamlClientResponse`
#### Description
A type definition that represents the response structure from a Document Retrieval SAML client request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gateway | XCAGateway | The XCA gateway information |
| mtomResponse | MtomAttachments (optional) | The MTOM response data |
| errorResponse | string (optional) | Error message if the request failed |
| outboundRequest | OutboundDocumentRetrievalReq | The original outbound request details |

### `sendSignedDrRequest`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that sends a signed Document Retrieval request to a Carequality gateway.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| request | SignedDrRequest | The signed DR request object |
| samlCertsAndKeys | SamlCertsAndKeys | SAML certificates and keys for authentication |
| patientId | string | The patient's identifier |
| cxId | string | The context identifier |
| index | number | The index of the request in a batch |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | Promise&lt;DrSamlClientResponse&gt; | A promise that resolves to the DR SAML client response |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends the signed XML request using MTOM via `sendSignedXmlMtom`.
2. Logs the successful request.
3. Stores the DR response using `storeDrResponse`.
4. Returns a `DrSamlClientResponse` object with the gateway, MTOM response, and outbound request details.
5. If an error occurs, it logs the error details and returns a `DrSamlClientResponse` object with error information.

## Error Handling
The function uses a try-catch block to handle errors. If an error occurs during the request sending process, it logs the error details, including HTTP/SSL failures and any additional error response data. The error is then formatted and returned as part of the `DrSamlClientResponse`.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging function `log` from the `out` utility to log information about the request sending process and any errors that occur.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk | Provides types and interfaces for IHE gateway operations |
| errorToString | Utility function to convert errors to strings |
| sendSignedXmlMtom | Function to send signed XML using MTOM |
| storeDrResponse | Function to store Document Retrieval responses |
| out | Logging utility |

This code is a crucial part of the document retrieval process in a healthcare interoperability system, handling the complexities of secure communication with Carequality gateways and efficient document transfer using MTOM.
