## High-level description
This code defines a function `sendSignedXcpdRequest` that sends a signed XCPD (Cross-Community Patient Discovery) request to a specified gateway. It handles the sending process, logs the results, and stores the responses. The code also defines a type `XCPDSamlClientResponse` that extends the `SamlClientResponse` with additional XCPD-specific properties.

## Code Structure
The main function `sendSignedXcpdRequest` uses the `sendSignedXml` function to send the request and then processes the response. It also utilizes logging functions and error handling to manage the request process.

## References
- `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk`: Imports types and interfaces related to XCPD and patient discovery.
- `../../../../../../util/error/shared`: Imports error handling utilities.
- `../../../saml/security/types`: Imports SAML certificate and key types.
- `../../../saml/saml-client`: Imports SAML client functionality.
- `../create/iti55-envelope`: Imports the `SignedXcpdRequest` type.
- `../../../../../../util/log`: Imports logging utilities.
- `../../../monitor/store`: Imports the `storeXcpdResponses` function.

## Symbols

### `XCPDSamlClientResponse`
#### Description
A type that extends `SamlClientResponse` with additional properties specific to XCPD requests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gateway | XCPDGateway | The XCPD gateway information |
| outboundRequest | OutboundPatientDiscoveryReq | The outbound patient discovery request |

### `sendSignedXcpdRequest`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that sends a signed XCPD request to a specified gateway and processes the response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| request | SignedXcpdRequest | The signed XCPD request to be sent |
| samlCertsAndKeys | SamlCertsAndKeys | SAML certificates and keys for authentication |
| patientId | string | The ID of the patient |
| cxId | string | The context ID |
| index | number | The index of the request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| XCPDSamlClientResponse | Promise&lt;XCPDSamlClientResponse&gt; | The response from the XCPD request |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends the signed XML request using `sendSignedXml` function.
2. Logs the successful sending of the request.
3. Stores the XCPD responses using `storeXcpdResponses` function.
4. If successful, returns an object with gateway, response, success status, and outbound request information.
5. If an error occurs, logs the error details and returns an object with error information.

## Error Handling
The function uses a try-catch block to handle errors. If an error occurs during the request sending process, it logs the error details and returns a response object with `success: false` and the error message.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging function `log` from the imported `out` utility. It logs successful request sending and any errors that occur during the process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk | Provides types and interfaces for XCPD and patient discovery |
| util/error/shared | Provides error handling utilities |
| saml/security/types | Provides types for SAML certificates and keys |
| saml/saml-client | Provides functionality for sending signed XML |
| util/log | Provides logging utilities |
| monitor/store | Provides functionality to store XCPD responses |

## TODOs
There is a TODO-like comment in the form of an eslint-disable comment:
```typescript
//eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
```
This suggests that the error handling could be improved to use a more specific type instead of `any`.
