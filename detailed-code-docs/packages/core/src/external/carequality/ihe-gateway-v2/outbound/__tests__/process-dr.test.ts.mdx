title: "process-dr.test.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `processDrResponse` function, which processes Document Retrieve (DR) responses in the context of an IHE Gateway implementation. The tests cover various scenarios, including MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) messages with and without attachments, different file types, and error cases.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main describe blocks: one for testing MTOM responses with and without attachments, and another for testing various DR response scenarios. The tests use Jest as the testing framework and mock S3 operations to isolate the tests from actual S3 interactions.

## Symbols

### `beforeAll`
#### Description
Sets up mocks for S3 operations before running the tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Mocks the `uploadFile` method of `S3Utils` to return a resolved promise with mock S3 upload data.
- Mocks the `getFileInfoFromS3` method of `S3Utils` to return a resolved promise indicating the file doesn't exist.

### `afterAll`
#### Description
Restores all mocks after the tests are completed.

### `describe("dr-response")`
#### Description
Contains all the test cases for processing DR responses.

### `describe("processDrResponse for MTOM with/without attachments and for different file types")`
#### Description
Tests the processing of MTOM responses with and without attachments for various file types.

#### Internal Logic
- Iterates through test files (XML, PDF, TIFF) and tests MTOM responses for each.
- Creates MTOM messages with and without attachments.
- Calls `processDrResponse` and verifies the response structure and content types.

### `describe("processDrResponse")`
#### Description
Tests various scenarios for processing DR responses.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests processing of multiple DR responses.
- Tests processing of SOAP fault DR responses.
- Tests processing of registry error DR responses.
- Tests processing of empty DR responses.
- Tests processing of invalid (non-XML) responses.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fs | File system operations for reading test files |
| path | Handling file paths |
| uuid | Generating unique identifiers |
| S3Utils | Mocking S3 operations |
| processDrResponse | The main function being tested |
| createMtomMessageWithAttachments, createMtomMessageWithoutAttachments | Helper functions for creating MTOM messages |

## Error Handling
The tests include scenarios for handling various error cases, such as SOAP faults, registry errors, and invalid responses. These are verified by checking the `operationOutcome` property of the response.

## Performance Considerations
The tests mock S3 operations to avoid actual S3 interactions, which improves test performance and isolation.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
