## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of outbound operations for the Carequality IHE Gateway v2. It includes functionality for patient discovery (XCPD), document query (XCA ITI-38), and document retrieval (XCA ITI-39) operations. The code is structured to handle asynchronous processing, request creation, signing, sending, and response processing for these healthcare interoperability standards.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables secure and standardized healthcare information exchange across different communities. It performs several key functions:

1. Patient Discovery (XCPD):
   - Creates and signs XCPD requests with SAML assertions for secure communication.
   - Sends requests to specified gateways and processes responses.
   - Handles patient matching and creates standardized response objects.

2. Document Query (XCA ITI-38):
   - Generates and signs SOAP envelopes for Cross-Gateway Query requests.
   - Sends queries to Carequality gateways and processes responses.
   - Parses XML responses and extracts relevant document metadata.

3. Document Retrieval (XCA ITI-39):
   - Creates and signs SOAP envelopes for Cross-Gateway Retrieve requests.
   - Sends retrieval requests and handles responses, including MTOM-encoded data.
   - Processes retrieved documents, storing them in S3 and creating structured responses.

4. Asynchronous Processing:
   - Implements chunking and asynchronous processing using AWS Lambda functions for handling large datasets efficiently.

5. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Provides comprehensive error handling for various scenarios, including HTTP errors, patient-related errors, and schema validation errors.
   - Implements detailed logging for troubleshooting and monitoring.

6. Security:
   - Uses SAML authentication and digital signatures to ensure secure communication between healthcare systems.

In simpler terms, this code acts as a secure messenger and data processor for healthcare systems. When a healthcare provider needs to find a patient or request their information from another provider or community, it prepares the request in a standardized, secure format, sends it to the appropriate gateway, and then processes the response, extracting and storing the relevant patient data.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `ihe-gateway-v2.ts`: Defines the abstract `IHEGatewayV2` class, which serves as the interface for the IHE Gateway V2 operations.

2. `ihe-gateway-v2-async.ts`: Implements the `IHEGatewayV2Async` class, extending `IHEGatewayV2` to provide asynchronous processing capabilities using AWS Lambda functions.

3. `ihe-gateway-v2-logic.ts`: Contains the core logic for sending and processing patient discovery, document query, and document retrieval requests.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. The `IHEGatewayV2Async` class is used to initiate asynchronous operations.
2. These operations are processed in chunks by AWS Lambda functions.
3. The core logic in `ihe-gateway-v2-logic.ts` handles the creation, signing, sending, and processing of requests and responses.
4. Specific operations (XCPD, XCA ITI-38, XCA ITI-39) are handled by dedicated modules in the `xcpd` and `xca` subdirectories.

## Key Files
1. `xcpd/create/index.ts`: Contains functions for creating and signing XCPD requests.
2. `xcpd/send/index.ts`: Provides functionality for sending signed XCPD requests.
3. `xcpd/process/xcpd-response.ts`: Handles the processing of XCPD responses.
4. `xca/create/iti38-envelope.ts` and `xca/create/iti39-envelope.ts`: Handle the creation and signing of SOAP envelopes for document queries and retrievals.
5. `xca/send/dq-requests.ts` and `xca/send/dr-requests.ts`: Contain functions for sending Document Query and Document Retrieval requests.
6. `xca/process/dq-response.ts` and `xca/process/dr-response.ts`: Process responses from document queries and retrievals.
7. `xca/mtom/builder.ts` and `xca/mtom/parser.ts`: Provide functionality for creating and parsing MTOM messages.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk: Provides types, schemas, and constants for IHE Gateway operations.
2. @metriport/shared: Offers utility functions used across the codebase.
3. dayjs: Used for date and time manipulation.
4. fast-xml-parser: Employed for XML parsing and building.
5. zod: Used for schema definition and validation.
6. AWS SDK: Used for interacting with AWS services, particularly Lambda and S3.
7. axios: Used for making HTTP requests.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the code uses several environment-specific values and constants:

1. SAML certificates and keys: Used for signing SOAP envelopes and SAML assertions.
2. Gateway-specific information: Different gateways may require specific configurations.
3. AWS Lambda and S3 configurations: Used for asynchronous processing and document storage.
4. Various constants for chunking and processing limits, such as `MAX_GATEWAYS_BEFORE_CHUNK` and `MAX_DOCUMENT_QUERY_REQUESTS_PER_INVOCATION`.

These configurations are typically passed into the functions as parameters or accessed through environment variables, allowing for flexibility and security in managing sensitive information.
