## Notes
- This file is crucial for unit testing and integration testing of the Carequality and IHE Gateway functionalities.
- The constants defined here simulate various scenarios, including successful requests/responses, error cases, and edge cases with missing or multiple fields.
- The test certificate and key should only be used for testing purposes and never in a production environment.
