## High-level description
This file defines constants related to status responses for an IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Gateway, specifically for XCA (Cross-Community Access) outbound processing. It provides standardized status strings for successful and partially successful operations.

## Symbols

### `successStatus`
#### Description
A constant string representing a fully successful operation status.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| successStatus | string | The string "Success" indicating a completely successful operation |

### `partialSuccessStatus`
#### Description
A constant string representing a partially successful operation status.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| partialSuccessStatus | string | The string "PartialSuccess" indicating a partially successful operation |

## Dependencies

## Configuration
This file does not contain any configuration options.

## Error Handling
This file does not implement any error handling mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API itself, these constants are likely used in API responses or internal status checks related to XCA outbound processing in the IHE Gateway.

| Constant | Value | Description |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| successStatus | "Success" | Indicates a fully successful operation |
| partialSuccessStatus | "PartialSuccess" | Indicates a partially successful operation |

These constants provide a standardized way to represent operation statuses, which can be used consistently throughout the IHE Gateway implementation for XCA outbound processing. They allow for clear differentiation between fully successful operations and those that were only partially successful, which is crucial in healthcare data exchange scenarios where partial data retrieval or processing might occur.
