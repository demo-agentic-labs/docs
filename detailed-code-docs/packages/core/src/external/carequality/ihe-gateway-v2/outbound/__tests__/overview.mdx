## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the outbound operations of the Carequality IHE Gateway v2 implementation. It includes tests for processing Document Query (DQ), Document Retrieve (DR), and Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) responses, as well as utility functions for MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) message handling and file type detection.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory verifies the correct functioning of various components of the Carequality IHE Gateway v2 outbound operations:

1. It tests the processing of Document Query (DQ) responses, ensuring that successful responses, empty responses, and error responses are handled correctly.
2. It verifies the processing of Document Retrieve (DR) responses, including MTOM messages with and without attachments, for different file types.
3. It checks the Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) response processing, covering scenarios such as successful matches, multiple addresses and names, no matches, and error responses.
4. It tests the file type detection functionality for various file formats in non-XML body flows.
5. It provides utility functions for creating and parsing MTOM messages with and without attachments.

These tests ensure that the outbound operations of the Carequality IHE Gateway v2 implementation correctly handle different response scenarios, maintain data integrity, and properly manage errors.

## Key Files
1. `constants.ts`: Contains test data, sample requests, and responses used across the test suite.
2. `detect-file-type.test.ts`: Tests the `detectFileType` function for various file types in non-XML body flows.
3. `mtom.ts`: Provides utility functions for creating and parsing MTOM messages.
4. `process-dq.test.ts`: Contains tests for processing Document Query responses.
5. `process-dr.test.ts`: Includes tests for processing Document Retrieve responses, focusing on MTOM handling.
6. `process-xcpd.test.ts`: Tests the processing of Cross-Community Patient Discovery responses.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Jest: Used as the testing framework for all test files.
2. fs and path: Node.js built-in modules for file system operations and path handling.
3. uuid: For generating unique identifiers in test data.
4. dayjs: Used for date manipulation and formatting in test data.
5. @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk: Provides types and schemas for IHE Gateway interactions.
6. Internal utility functions: Such as `detectFileType`, `parseFileFromString`, and `processDqResponse`.

## Configuration
The test suite uses various configuration files and test data:

1. Sample XML files: Used to simulate different response scenarios for DQ, DR, and XCPD operations.
2. Test certificates and keys: Used for testing SAML signing and verification (TEST_CERT and TEST_KEY in constants.ts).
3. Mock S3 operations: Used in process-dr.test.ts to isolate tests from actual S3 interactions.

The tests are designed to be run in a controlled environment and do not require external services or databases. They use mocked data and responses to simulate various scenarios and edge cases.

Code snippet from `process-dr.test.ts` showing the setup of S3 mocks:

```typescript
beforeAll(() =&gt; {
  jest.spyOn(S3Utils, "uploadFile").mockResolvedValue({
    ETag: "mockETag",
    Location: "mockLocation",
    Key: "mockKey",
    Bucket: "mockBucket",
  });
  jest.spyOn(S3Utils, "getFileInfoFromS3").mockResolvedValue({
    exists: false,
    size: 0,
  });
});

afterAll(() =&gt; {
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});
```

This test suite plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the Carequality IHE Gateway v2 outbound operations, covering a wide range of scenarios and edge cases.
