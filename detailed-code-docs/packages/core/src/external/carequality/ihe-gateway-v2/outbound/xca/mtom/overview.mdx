## High-level description
This directory contains code for handling MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) in the context of Carequality's IHE Gateway v2 for outbound XCA (Cross-Community Access) communications. It provides functionality for creating, parsing, and manipulating MTOM messages, which are used to efficiently transmit binary data within SOAP messages in healthcare data exchange scenarios.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates the following workflows:

1. Creation of MTOM messages: It generates the content type and payload for MTOM-encoded SOAP messages, which is crucial for sending large binary data efficiently in healthcare document exchange.

2. Parsing of MTOM responses: It provides functionality to parse incoming MTOM responses, extracting individual parts and their associated headers.

3. Content-ID (CID) handling: It offers utilities for manipulating CID references, which are used to link binary attachments within MTOM messages.

4. SOAP to MTOM conversion: It includes a function to convert standard SOAP responses to MTOM format, enabling compatibility with systems that expect MTOM-encoded messages.

These processes are essential in healthcare interoperability scenarios, where large documents or images need to be transmitted efficiently and securely between different healthcare providers or systems.

## Key Files

1. `builder.ts`:
   - Contains the `createMtomContentTypeAndPayload` function for generating MTOM content type and payload.
   - Constructs multipart MIME messages with appropriate headers and boundaries.

2. `cid.ts`:
   - Provides utility functions for handling Content-ID (CID) references in MTOM attachments.
   - Includes functions to strip CID prefixes, add angle brackets, and process CID strings for use in XML documents.

3. `parser.ts`:
   - Offers functionality for parsing MTOM responses.
   - Defines interfaces for MTOM parts and attachments.
   - Includes functions to extract boundaries from content types and convert SOAP responses to MTOM format.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries:

1. `whatwg-mimetype`: Used for parsing MIME types in the MTOM response handling.
2. `formidable`: Specifically, the `MultipartParser` is used for parsing multipart MIME messages in MTOM responses.

These dependencies are crucial for handling the complex structure of MTOM messages and ensuring compatibility with MIME standards used in healthcare data exchange.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the code uses several constants that could be considered configuration values:

1. In `builder.ts`:
   - `boundary`: "MIMEBoundary782a6cafc4cf4aab9dbf291522804454"
   - `contentId`: "&lt;doc0@metriport.com&gt;"
   - `carriageReturn`: "\r\n"

These values are used in constructing MTOM messages and could potentially be made configurable if different systems require specific boundary or content ID formats.

Here's an example of how the `createMtomContentTypeAndPayload` function in `builder.ts` constructs an MTOM message:

```typescript
function createMtomContentTypeAndPayload(signedXml: string) {
  const contentType = `multipart/related; boundary="${boundary}"; type="application/xop+xml"; start="${contentId}"; start-info="application/soap+xml"`;

  const payload = `--${boundary}${carriageReturn}` +
    `Content-Type: application/xop+xml; charset=UTF-8; type="application/soap+xml"${carriageReturn}` +
    `Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary${carriageReturn}` +
    `Content-ID: ${contentId}${carriageReturn}${carriageReturn}` +
    `${signedXml}${carriageReturn}` +
    `--${boundary}--`;

  return { contentType, payload: Buffer.from(payload) };
}
```

This function demonstrates how the MTOM message is structured with appropriate headers and content, using the predefined constants to ensure consistency.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with MTOM in the context of healthcare data exchange, specifically tailored for use with Carequality's IHE Gateway v2 for outbound XCA communications. The code handles the complexities of MTOM encoding and decoding, enabling efficient and standardized transmission of large binary data in healthcare interoperability scenarios.
