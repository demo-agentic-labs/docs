## High-level description
This code is a test suite for the `detectFileType` function, focusing on its ability to correctly identify various file types within a non-XML body flow. It tests the function's accuracy in detecting file types from raw content, base64-encoded content, and when embedded within an XML structure.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized using Jest's `describe` and `it` blocks. It iterates over a set of test files, each with different file types, and performs multiple assertions for each file type.

## References
- `detectFileType` function from "../../../../../util/file-type"
- `parseFileFromString` function from "../xca/process/parse-file-from-string"
- `testFiles` constant from "./constants"

## Symbols

### `describe("detectFileType for all file types with non-xml body flow", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that encompasses all the tests for different file types.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads a non-XML body template file.
2. Iterates over each test file defined in `testFiles`.
3. For each file type, it runs three separate tests.

### `testFiles.forEach(...)`
#### Description
This loop iterates over each test file, creating a nested `describe` block for each file type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| testFiles | Array | An array of objects containing file information (name, mimeType, fileExtension) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the content of each test file.
2. Prepares the file content in various formats (raw, base64-encoded, embedded in XML).
3. Runs three separate test cases for each file type.

### `it("should correctly identify the ${fileExtension} file from raw content", ...)`
#### Description
This test case checks if `detectFileType` correctly identifies the file type from raw content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `detectFileType` with the raw file content.
2. Asserts that the returned object matches the expected MIME type and file extension.

### `it("should correctly identify the ${fileExtension} file after converting to b64 and then decoding", ...)`
#### Description
This test case verifies if `detectFileType` correctly identifies the file type from base64-encoded content after decoding.

#### Internal Logic
1. Decodes the base64-encoded file content.
2. Calls `detectFileType` with the decoded content.
3. Asserts that the returned object matches the expected MIME type and file extension.

### `it("should correctly extract and parse the embedded file from base64 encoded non-xml-body for ${fileExtension}", ...)`
#### Description
This test case checks if the file can be correctly extracted and parsed when embedded in a base64-encoded non-XML body.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `parseFileFromString` with the modified non-XML body (containing the embedded file).
2. Asserts that the parsed file's MIME type matches the expected MIME type.
