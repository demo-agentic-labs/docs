## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `processXCPDResponse` function, which processes Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) responses in the context of healthcare interoperability. The tests cover various scenarios, including successful matches, multiple addresses and names, no matches, and error responses.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses Jest and includes multiple test cases that call `processXCPDResponse` with different input XML strings and expected outcomes. It imports necessary dependencies, test data, and XML files for various scenarios.

## Symbols

### `describe("processXCPDResponse", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `processXCPDResponse` function.

#### Internal Logic
The suite contains multiple test cases that cover different scenarios for XCPD responses.

### `it("should process the match XCPD response correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the processing of a successful XCPD match response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `processXCPDResponse` with a matching XML response.
2. Compares the result with the expected response, allowing for dynamic timestamp values.

### `it("should process the match XCPD response with multiple addresses and patient names correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the processing of a successful XCPD match response with multiple addresses and patient names.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous test, but uses a different XML input and expected output.

### `it("should process the match XCPD response with no addresses correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the processing of a successful XCPD match response without address information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Processes the response with no addresses.
2. Validates the response against the `outboundPatientDiscoveryRespSchema`.

### `it("should correctly identify and process a no match XCPD response", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the processing of an XCPD response with no patient match.

#### Internal Logic
Verifies that the `patientMatch` property is false when no match is found.

### `it("should process the error XCPD response correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the processing of an error XCPD response.

#### Internal Logic
Checks that the `patientMatch` property is null when an error occurs.

### `it("should process the HTTP error XCPD response correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the processing of an HTTP error in the XCPD response.

#### Internal Logic
Verifies that the `operationOutcome` is truthy and `patientMatch` is null for HTTP errors.

### `it("should process response that is not a string correctly", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the processing of an invalid XCPD response (non-XML string).

#### Internal Logic
Ensures that the function handles invalid input gracefully, setting `operationOutcome` to truthy and `patientMatch` to null.

## Dependencies
- `fs`: File system module for reading XML files.
- `path`: Path module for handling file paths.
- `processXCPDResponse`: The main function being tested.
- `outboundXcpdRequest`, `expectedXcpdResponse`, `expectedMultiNameAddressResponse`: Test constants.
- `outboundPatientDiscoveryRespSchema`: Schema for validating responses.

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, including HTTP errors and invalid responses, ensuring that the `processXCPDResponse` function handles these cases appropriately.
