## High-level description
This directory contains code for handling outbound Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) requests in the context of an IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) gateway implementation. It provides functionality for creating, signing, sending, and processing XCPD requests and responses.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key functions in the XCPD process:

1. Creation and Signing: It generates XML-based SOAP messages with SAML assertions for secure communication between healthcare systems. These messages are then signed using provided certificates and keys.

2. Sending Requests: It sends signed XCPD requests to specified gateways and handles the responses.

3. Response Processing: It processes XCPD responses, converting XML responses into structured data, handling patient matching, and creating standardized response objects.

4. Error Handling: It manages various types of errors that may occur during the XCPD process, including HTTP errors, patient-related errors, and schema validation errors.

5. Schema Validation: It uses Zod schemas to validate and parse patient registry profile data and ITI-55 responses, ensuring data integrity and type safety.

These components work together to facilitate the entire outbound XCPD process, from request creation to response handling, ensuring secure and standardized communication between healthcare systems for patient discovery operations.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `create/index.ts`: Contains functions for creating and signing XCPD requests, particularly `createITI5SoapEnvelope` and `createAndSignBulkXCPDRequests`.

2. `send/index.ts`: Provides the `sendSignedXcpdRequest` function, which is responsible for sending the signed requests to the appropriate gateways.

3. `process/xcpd-response.ts`: Contains the `processXCPDResponse` function, which orchestrates the processing of XCPD responses.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. XCPD requests are created and signed using functions from the `create` directory.
2. These signed requests are then sent using the `sendSignedXcpdRequest` function from the `send` directory.
3. The responses are processed using functions from the `process` directory, particularly `processXCPDResponse`.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk`: Provides types and schemas for IHE gateway operations.
2. `fast-xml-parser`: Used for XML building, parsing, and manipulation.
3. `dayjs`: Used for date and time manipulation.
4. `zod`: Used for creating and composing schemas for data validation and parsing.
5. `@metriport/shared`: Provides utility functions used across the codebase.

Internal dependencies include various modules for SAML security, constants, and utility functions.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the code likely relies on configurations set at a higher level in the project structure, particularly for aspects like gateway information and request handling. The code makes use of various schemas and types defined in other parts of the project, indicating a reliance on the overall project structure and shared definitions.

Key configurable elements include:
- SAML certificates and keys for request signing
- Gateway information for sending requests
- Patient and provider information for request creation

In summary, this directory contains crucial components for handling the complete outbound XCPD process in an IHE gateway implementation. It provides robust functionality for creating, signing, sending, and processing XCPD requests and responses, ensuring secure and standardized patient discovery operations between healthcare systems.
