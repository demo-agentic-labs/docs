## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for SAML timestamp signature verification in the context of IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) gateway interactions. It tests the creation, signing, and verification of SOAP envelopes for different IHE transactions (ITI-55, ITI-38, and ITI-39) with a focus on timestamp integrity and signature validation.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single describe block containing multiple test cases. Each test case focuses on a specific aspect of SAML timestamp signature verification for different IHE transactions.

## Symbols

### `describe("SAML Timestamp Signature Verification", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that groups all the test cases related to SAML timestamp signature verification.

### `it("should fail verification if the iti55 timestamp text is modified after signing", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that modifying the timestamp text after signing an ITI-55 SOAP envelope causes the verification to fail.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-55 SOAP envelope
2. Signs the envelope with a timestamp
3. Modifies the timestamp text
4. Attempts to verify the modified envelope
5. Expects the verification to fail

### `it("should fail verification if the iti55 timestamp signature is modified", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that modifying the timestamp signature after signing an ITI-55 SOAP envelope causes the verification to fail.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-55 SOAP envelope
2. Signs the envelope with a timestamp
3. Modifies the signature value
4. Attempts to verify the modified envelope
5. Expects the verification to fail

### `it("should fail verification if the iti55 timestamp digest is modified", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that modifying the timestamp digest after signing an ITI-55 SOAP envelope causes the verification to fail.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-55 SOAP envelope
2. Signs the envelope with a timestamp
3. Modifies the digest value
4. Attempts to verify the modified envelope
5. Expects the verification to fail

### `it("should sign and verify the iti55 envelope successfully with timestamp", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that a properly signed ITI-55 SOAP envelope with a timestamp can be successfully verified.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-55 SOAP envelope
2. Signs the envelope with a timestamp
3. Attempts to verify the signed envelope
4. Expects the verification to succeed

### `it("should sign and verify the ITI38 envelope successfully with timestamp", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that a properly signed ITI-38 SOAP envelope with a timestamp can be successfully verified.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-38 SOAP envelope
2. Signs the envelope with a timestamp
3. Attempts to verify the signed envelope
4. Expects the verification to succeed

### `it("should fail verification if the ITI38 timestamp text is modified after signing", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that modifying the timestamp text after signing an ITI-38 SOAP envelope causes the verification to fail.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-38 SOAP envelope
2. Signs the envelope with a timestamp
3. Modifies the timestamp text
4. Attempts to verify the modified envelope
5. Expects the verification to fail

### `it("should sign and verify the ITI39 envelope successfully with timestamp", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that a properly signed ITI-39 SOAP envelope with a timestamp can be successfully verified.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-39 SOAP envelope
2. Signs the envelope with a timestamp
3. Attempts to verify the signed envelope
4. Expects the verification to succeed

### `it("should fail verification if the ITI39 timestamp text is modified after signing", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that modifying the timestamp text after signing an ITI-39 SOAP envelope causes the verification to fail.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-39 SOAP envelope
2. Signs the envelope with a timestamp
3. Modifies the timestamp text
4. Attempts to verify the modified envelope
5. Expects the verification to fail

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk | Provides types and functions for IHE gateway interactions |
| fast-xml-parser | Used for XML parsing and manipulation |
| dayjs | Used for date and time operations |

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's `expect` function to assert the expected outcomes. If any assertion fails, the test case will fail and provide an error message.
