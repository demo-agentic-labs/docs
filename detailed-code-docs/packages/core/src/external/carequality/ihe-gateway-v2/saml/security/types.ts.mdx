## High-level description
This file defines a TypeScript type `SamlCertsAndKeys` which represents the structure for SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) certificates and keys. It is used for handling security-related information in the context of SAML authentication and communication.

## Symbols

### `SamlCertsAndKeys`
#### Description
`SamlCertsAndKeys` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure for storing SAML-related security information. It includes four properties: certificate chain, public certificate, private key, and private key password.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| certChain | string | The certificate chain for SAML authentication |
| publicCert | string | The public certificate for SAML authentication |
| privateKey | string | The private key for SAML authentication |
| privateKeyPassword | string | The password for the private key |

#### Outputs
As a type definition, it doesn't produce outputs. It's used to type-check objects that should conform to this structure.

## References
This type is referenced and used in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `saml-client.ts`, it's used as a parameter type for the `sendSignedXml` and `sendSignedXmlMtom` functions.
2. In `iti38-envelope.ts`, it's used as a parameter type for the `createAndSignDQRequest` and `createAndSignBulkDQRequests` functions.
3. In `secrets.ts`, it's used as the return type for the `getSamlCertsAndKeys` function.
4. In `sign.ts`, it's used as a parameter type for the `signFullSaml` function.

These references indicate that `SamlCertsAndKeys` is a crucial type for handling SAML-related security operations across different parts of the application, particularly in the context of IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) gateway interactions and document queries.
