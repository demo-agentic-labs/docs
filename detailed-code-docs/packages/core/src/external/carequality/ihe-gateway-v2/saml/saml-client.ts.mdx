## High-level description
This code implements a SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) client for secure communication in a healthcare interoperability context. It provides functionality to send signed XML requests for patient discovery, document queries, and document retrieval to Carequality-compliant gateways.

## Code Structure
The main functionality is encapsulated in the `sendSignedXml` and `sendSignedXmlMtom` functions. These functions use various utility functions and configurations to create secure HTTPS connections, sign requests, and handle responses. The code also includes error handling and retry logic for network operations.

## Symbols

### `sendSignedXml`
#### Description
Sends a signed XML request to a specified URL using HTTPS with mutual TLS authentication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| signedXml | string | The signed XML payload to send |
| url | string | The destination URL |
| samlCertsAndKeys | SamlCertsAndKeys | Object containing necessary certificates and keys |
| isDq | boolean | Flag indicating if this is a Document Query request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | string | The response body from the server |
| contentType | string | The content type of the response |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the trusted key store
2. Creates an HTTPS agent with the necessary certificates and configurations
3. Sends the request using axios
4. Implements retry logic for Document Query requests
5. Returns the response and content type

### `sendSignedXmlMtom`
#### Description
Sends a signed XML request using MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) encoding.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| signedXml | string | The signed XML payload to send |
| url | string | The destination URL |
| samlCertsAndKeys | SamlCertsAndKeys | Object containing necessary certificates and keys |
| oid | string | Object Identifier |
| requestChunkId | string | undefined | Identifier for the request chunk |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mtomParts | MtomAttachments | Parsed MTOM attachments from the response |
| rawResponse | Buffer | The raw response data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an HTTPS agent similar to `sendSignedXml`
2. Prepares the MTOM payload
3. Sends the request with retry logic
4. Parses the MTOM response
5. Returns the parsed MTOM parts and raw response

### `loadTrustedKeyStore`
#### Description
Loads the trusted key store from an S3 bucket.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| trustBundle | string | The contents of the trust store file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the environment (staging or production)
2. Retrieves the trust store file from the specified S3 bucket
3. Returns the contents of the file as a string

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Provides utility functions for network retries |
| aws-sdk | Used for interacting with AWS services (S3) |
| axios | HTTP client for making requests |
| crypto | Used for SSL/TLS configurations |
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation library |
| https | Node.js HTTPS module for secure communications |

## Error Handling
The code implements custom error handling using the `MetriportError` class. It also uses the `executeWithNetworkRetries` function from `@metriport/shared` to handle network-related errors and implement retry logic.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging utility (`log` function) to output debug information and errors.

## Configuration
The code relies on various environment variables and configuration settings, including:
- AWS region
- Carequality trust bundle bucket name
- SSL/TLS certificate and key configurations
- HTTP timeout settings

## Performance Considerations
The code implements retry logic with exponential backoff for network operations, which can help improve reliability in unstable network conditions. It also uses MTOM for efficient handling of large payloads in document retrieval operations.
