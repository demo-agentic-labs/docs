## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) envelope signature verification in the context of IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) transactions, specifically ITI-55 (XCPD), ITI-38 (XCA Query), and ITI-39 (XCA Retrieve). The tests verify the creation, signing, and verification of SOAP envelopes for these transactions, as well as testing various scenarios where the SAML assertion or signature might be tampered with.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single describe block containing multiple test cases. Each test case focuses on a specific aspect of SAML envelope creation, signing, and verification for different IHE transactions (ITI-55, ITI-38, and ITI-39).

## Symbols

### `describe("SAML XCPD Envelope Signature Verification", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that groups all the test cases related to SAML XCPD envelope signature verification.

### `it("should sign and verify the iti55 envelope successfully with envelope", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that an ITI-55 (XCPD) envelope can be successfully created, signed, and verified.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ITI-55 SOAP envelope using `createITI5SoapEnvelope`
2. Signs the envelope using `signEnvelope`
3. Verifies the signed envelope using `verifySaml`
4. Expects the verification to be successful

### `it("should fail verification if the iti55 SAML assertion is modified", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case checks that verification fails if the ITI-55 SAML assertion is modified after signing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and signs an ITI-55 SOAP envelope
2. Modifies the SAML assertion by replacing the Issuer
3. Attempts to verify the modified envelope
4. Expects the verification to fail

### `it("should fail verification if the iti55 SAML assertion signature is modified", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case ensures that verification fails if the ITI-55 SAML assertion signature is modified after signing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and signs an ITI-55 SOAP envelope
2. Modifies the SignatureValue in the SAML assertion
3. Attempts to verify the modified envelope
4. Expects the verification to fail

### `it("should fail verification if the iti55 SAML assertion digest is modified", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that verification fails if the ITI-55 SAML assertion digest is modified after signing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and signs an ITI-55 SOAP envelope
2. Modifies the DigestValue in the SAML assertion
3. Attempts to verify the modified envelope
4. Expects the verification to fail

### Similar test cases for ITI-38 and ITI-39
The file includes similar test cases for ITI-38 (XCA Query) and ITI-39 (XCA Retrieve) transactions, following the same pattern as the ITI-55 tests.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| createITI5SoapEnvelope | Creates ITI-55 SOAP envelope |
| createITI38SoapEnvelope | Creates ITI-38 SOAP envelope |
| createITI39SoapEnvelope | Creates ITI-39 SOAP envelope |
| verifySaml | Verifies SAML signature |
| signEnvelope | Signs SOAP envelope |
| TEST_CERT, TEST_KEY | Test certificate and private key |
| outboundXcpdRequest, outboundDqRequest, outboundDrRequest | Test data for requests |

## Error Handling
The test cases use Jest's `expect` function to assert the expected outcomes. If any assertion fails, the test case will fail and provide an error message.
