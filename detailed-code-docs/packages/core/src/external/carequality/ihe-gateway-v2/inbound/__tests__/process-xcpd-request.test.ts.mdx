title: "process-xcpd-request.test.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for processing inbound XCPD (Cross-Community Patient Discovery) requests and responses in the context of an IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) gateway. It tests the functionality of creating, signing, and processing XCPD requests and responses, including successful and error scenarios.

## Code Structure
The file consists of two main test suites: "Process Inbound Xcpd Request" and "Process Inbound Xcpd Response". Each suite contains multiple test cases that verify different aspects of XCPD request and response handling.

## References
This code references several functions and constants from other parts of the codebase, including:
- `processInboundXcpdRequest`, `createInboundXcpdResponse` from the inbound XCPD processing modules
- `createITI5SoapEnvelope`, `processXCPDResponse` from the outbound XCPD processing modules
- `signTimestamp` from the SAML security module
- `S3Utils` from the AWS S3 utility module
- Various constants and types from test utility files and SDK models

## Symbols

### `describe("Process Inbound Xcpd Request", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite focuses on testing the processing of inbound XCPD requests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the S3 file upload functionality.
2. Tests successful processing of an ITI-55 request.
3. Tests handling of an invalid ITI-55 request.

### `describe("Process Inbound Xcpd Response", ...)`
#### Description
This test suite focuses on testing the processing of inbound XCPD responses.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the S3 file upload functionality.
2. Tests processing of a successful ITI-55 response.
3. Tests processing of a no-match ITI-55 response.
4. Tests processing of an error ITI-55 response.

### `it("should process successful ITI-55 request", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the successful processing of a valid ITI-55 request.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a SOAP envelope with test data.
2. Signs the envelope.
3. Processes the inbound XCPD request.
4. Compares the processed request with the original outbound request.

### `it("should process invalid ITI-55 request correctly", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the handling of an invalid ITI-55 request.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an unsigned SOAP envelope.
2. Expects the processing to throw an error.

### `it("should process ITI-55 success response", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the processing of a successful ITI-55 response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock response object.
2. Creates an XML response using the mock data.
3. Processes the XCPD response.
4. Verifies the processed response matches the expected data.

### `it("should process ITI-55 no match response", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the processing of an ITI-55 response with no patient match.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock response object with no patient match.
2. Creates an XML response using the mock data.
3. Processes the XCPD response.
4. Verifies the processed response indicates no patient match.

### `it("should process ITI-55 error response", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the processing of an ITI-55 error response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock error response object.
2. Creates an XML response using the mock data.
3. Processes the XCPD response.
4. Verifies the processed response contains the expected error information.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and modules:
- `@metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk`: For XCPD-related types and utilities
- Jest: For running the tests and making assertions

## Error Handling
The tests include scenarios for handling both valid and invalid requests/responses, ensuring that errors are thrown or handled appropriately in each case.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this test file.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
