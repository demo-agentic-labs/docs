## High-level description
This code defines a function `createInboundDrResponse` that creates an XML response for an Inbound Document Retrieval (DR) request in the context of an IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Cross-Community Access (XCA) gateway. It processes the response data, constructs a SOAP envelope with appropriate headers and body, and returns the response as an XML string.

## Code Structure
The main function `createInboundDrResponse` relies on helper functions like `createIti39SoapBody` and `createSecurityHeader` to construct different parts of the SOAP response. It also uses utility functions from other modules for operations like S3 file downloads and XML building.

## Symbols

### createInboundDrResponse
#### Description
This asynchronous function creates an XML response for an Inbound Document Retrieval request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | InboundDocumentRetrievalResp | The response object containing document retrieval information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| xmlContent | string | The generated XML response as a string |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a security header using `createSecurityHeader`
2. Generates the SOAP body using `createIti39SoapBody`
3. Constructs the full SOAP envelope with headers and body
4. Uses `XMLBuilder` to convert the SOAP envelope object to an XML string

### createIti39SoapBody
#### Description
This asynchronous function creates the SOAP body for an ITI-39 (Cross Gateway Retrieve) response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | InboundDocumentRetrievalResp | The response object containing document retrieval information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| soapBody | object | An object representing the SOAP body structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines if the response was successful based on the presence of `documentReference`
2. For successful responses, downloads each document from S3 and encodes it in base64
3. For failed responses, constructs error information
4. Builds the SOAP body object with appropriate namespaces and content

### getS3UtilsInstance and setS3UtilsInstance
#### Description
These functions manage a singleton instance of the S3Utils class for S3 operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fast-xml-parser | Used for XML building |
| @metriport/ihe-gateway-sdk | Provides types and schemas for IHE gateway operations |
| @metriport/shared | Utility functions |
| aws-sdk | AWS SDK for S3 operations |

## Configuration
The code uses configuration values from the `Config` class:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for S3 operations |
| MEDICAL_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET_NAME | string | S3 bucket name for medical documents |

## Error Handling
The code throws errors for missing required information, such as document URN or content type. It also includes error information in the SOAP response for failed retrievals.

## Performance Considerations
The code downloads documents from S3 in parallel using `Promise.all`, which can improve performance when retrieving multiple documents.
