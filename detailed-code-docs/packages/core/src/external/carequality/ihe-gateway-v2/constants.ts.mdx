## High-level description
This code defines constants used in the Carequality IHE Gateway V2 implementation. It exports two main items: a `namespaces` object containing various XML namespace URIs, and an `expiresIn` constant representing an expiration time in minutes.

## Symbols

### `namespaces`
#### Description
An object containing key-value pairs of namespace prefixes and their corresponding URIs. These namespaces are commonly used in XML-based protocols and standards related to healthcare interoperability.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a constant object)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| namespaces | object | An object with namespace prefixes as keys and their URIs as values |

#### Internal Logic
The `namespaces` object defines 18 different namespace prefixes and their corresponding URIs. These include:
- Standard XML namespaces (e.g., soap, wsa, xsi, xsd)
- Security-related namespaces (e.g., wsse, saml2, ds, wsu, wss)
- Healthcare-specific namespaces (e.g., hl7, ce)
- IHE and ebXML related namespaces (e.g., urn, urnihe, urn2, rs)

### `expiresIn`
#### Description
A constant representing the expiration time in minutes.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a constant value)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| expiresIn | number | The expiration time in minutes |

#### Internal Logic
The `expiresIn` constant is set to 20, indicating a 20-minute expiration time.

## References
The constants defined in this file are used in other parts of the Carequality IHE Gateway V2 implementation. Specifically:

1. In the `shared.ts` file (as shown in the related code snippet), both `namespaces` and `expiresIn` are imported and used:
   - `namespaces` is used in the `createSecurityHeader` function to set XML namespace attributes.
   - `expiresIn` is used to calculate the expiration timestamp in the same function.

2. The namespace URIs defined here are likely used throughout the implementation for XML parsing, generation, and manipulation related to healthcare interoperability protocols.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It only defines JavaScript constants.

## Performance Considerations
As this file only defines constants, there are no significant performance considerations. The use of a single object (`namespaces`) to store multiple related constants can be considered a minor optimization, as it allows for more efficient importing and usage in other parts of the codebase.
