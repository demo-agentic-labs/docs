## High-level description
This code is a unit test for the STATE_MAPPINGS object in the Carequality module. It ensures that every US state defined in the USState enum has a corresponding entry in the STATE_MAPPINGS object, which is crucial for maintaining consistency in state representations across the application.

## Code Structure
The test file imports the USState enum from "@metriport/shared" and the STATE_MAPPINGS object from the "../shared" module. It then defines a single test case within a describe block to validate the completeness of the STATE_MAPPINGS object.

## Symbols

### `describe("State Mappings Validation", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that groups the state mapping validation tests.

### `it("should have an entry for every USState", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that every US state defined in the USState enum has a corresponding entry in the STATE_MAPPINGS object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves all values from the USState enum using `Object.values(USState)`.
2. Creates a Set of all values in the STATE_MAPPINGS object using `Object.values(STATE_MAPPINGS)`.
3. Iterates through each state in the USState enum.
4. For each state, it checks if the STATE_MAPPINGS Set contains that state.
5. Uses Jest's `expect` function to assert that each state is present in the STATE_MAPPINGS.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Imports the USState enum |
| ../shared | Imports the STATE_MAPPINGS object |
| Jest | Testing framework (implied by the use of `describe`, `it`, and `expect`) |

## References
- The test file references the USState enum, which is defined in the `packages/shared/src/domain/address/state.ts` file.
- It also references the STATE_MAPPINGS object, which is defined in the `packages/core/src/external/carequality/shared.ts` file.

## Notes
1. This test is crucial for ensuring that the STATE_MAPPINGS object is kept up-to-date with any changes to the USState enum.
2. The test uses a Set for efficient lookup of states in the STATE_MAPPINGS object.
3. The test doesn't check for extra entries in STATE_MAPPINGS that might not be in USState, only that all USState entries are present in STATE_MAPPINGS.
