## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the CommonWell Management API, which is used to interact with CommonWell Health Alliance services. It includes classes and interfaces for managing sessions, linking patients to organizations, and performing various API operations such as retrieving and updating member information and include lists.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a set of tools and interfaces to interact with the CommonWell Management API. It allows developers to:

1. Manage sessions with the CommonWell management portal, including login and cookie management.
2. Retrieve member information from the CommonWell network.
3. Get and update include lists for organizations, which determine which other organizations can access patient data.
4. Link patients to organizations within the CommonWell network.
5. Update patient information in local databases after changes in the CommonWell network.

The code also provides a mock implementation for testing and development purposes, allowing developers to simulate API interactions without making actual network requests.

## Key Files

### api-factory.ts
This file contains a factory function `makeApi` that creates an instance of `CommonWellManagementAPI` based on the current environment. It uses the `Config` utility to determine whether to return a mock implementation or a real implementation of the API.

### api-impl.ts
This file implements the `CommonWellManagementAPIImpl` class, which provides the actual implementation of the CommonWell Management API. It handles authentication, cookie management, and API requests for retrieving and updating member information and include lists.

### api-mock.ts
This file defines a mock implementation of the CommonWell Management API (`CommonWellManagementAPIMock`). It simulates API calls for testing or development purposes without making actual network requests.

### api.ts
This file defines the `CommonWellManagementAPI` interface and related types, providing a contract for the API implementation and mock.

### link-patients.ts
This file contains the `LinkPatients` class, which is responsible for updating the include list on CommonWell and triggering updates in the local database for a set of patients. It orchestrates the process of linking patients to organizations in the CommonWell network.

### session.ts
This file implements the `SessionManagement` class, which manages the session for the CommonWell management portal. It handles login, cookie management, and session maintenance for interacting with the CommonWell API.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the CommonWell Management API.
2. dayjs: Used for date and time manipulation.
3. playwright: Used for browser automation to handle the login process.
4. @metriport/shared: Provides utility functions.
5. @metriport/core: Provides various utilities and types used in the code.

Internal dependencies include:
- CookieManager: For handling authentication cookies.
- Config: For environment-specific configuration.
- PatientUpdater: For updating patient information.
- ECUpdater: For updating Enhanced Coverage information.
- MetriportError: For custom error handling.

## Configuration
The code uses various configuration options and environment variables:

1. `Config.isDev()`: Determines whether to use the mock or real API implementation.
2. `TIME_BETWEEN_INCLUDE_LIST_AND_UPDATE_ALL`: Configures the delay between updating the include list and updating all patients (default: 2 seconds).
3. Various timeout settings for different API operations.

The `SessionManagement` class also uses a `SessionManagementConfig` object for initialization, which includes settings for the CommonWell portal URL, credentials, and other necessary parameters.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the CommonWell Management API, including session management, patient linking, and data retrieval/update operations. It offers both real and mock implementations, making it suitable for production use as well as testing and development scenarios.
