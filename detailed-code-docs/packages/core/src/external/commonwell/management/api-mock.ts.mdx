## High-level description
This file defines a mock implementation of the CommonWell Management API. It provides a class `CommonWellManagementAPIMock` that implements the `CommonWellManagementAPI` interface, simulating API calls for testing or development purposes without actually making network requests.

## Code Structure
The `CommonWellManagementAPIMock` class implements methods defined in the `CommonWellManagementAPI` interface. Each method logs a message indicating what API call it would make in a real implementation but returns mock data or performs no actual operations.

## References
- `CommonWellManagementAPI`: An interface that this mock class implements.
- `Member`: A type used in the `getMember` method, likely defined in the same file as `CommonWellManagementAPI`.

## Symbols

### CommonWellManagementAPIMock
#### Description
A mock implementation of the CommonWell Management API, used for testing or development purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | \{ baseUrl: string \} | An object containing the base URL for the API |

#### Internal Logic
- The constructor normalizes the `baseUrl` by removing a trailing slash if present.
- Each method logs a message to the console indicating which API endpoint would be called in a real implementation.
- The methods return mock data or perform no actual operations.

### getBaseUrl
#### Description
Returns the base URL of the API.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| baseUrl | string | The base URL of the API |

### getMember
#### Description
Simulates fetching a member from the API.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| member | Promise&lt;Member \| undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to undefined, simulating no member found |

### getIncludeList
#### Description
Simulates fetching an include list from the API.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| includeList | Promise&lt;string[]&gt; | A promise that resolves to an empty array, simulating an empty include list |

### updateIncludeList
#### Description
Simulates updating the include list on the API.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves with no value, simulating a successful update |

## Side Effects
The methods in this class log messages to the console, which could be considered a side effect. However, these are intentional for debugging and development purposes.

## Dependencies
This file depends on the `CommonWellManagementAPI` interface and the `Member` type, which are likely defined in a related file (possibly `./api.ts`).

## Error Handling
This mock implementation does not include explicit error handling. All methods return successful responses or empty data.

## Logging
The class uses `console.log` to output messages indicating which API endpoints would be called in a real implementation. This is useful for debugging and understanding the flow of API calls during development or testing.
