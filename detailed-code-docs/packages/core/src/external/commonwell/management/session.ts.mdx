## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| playwright | Used for browser automation to handle login process |
| @metriport/core | Provides various utilities and types used in the code |

## Error Handling
The code uses try-catch blocks to handle errors during the login process. When an error occurs, it captures a screenshot and includes it in the error details.

## Performance Considerations
The code includes sleep intervals between steps to allow for page loading and to mimic human-like interaction with the portal.
