## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the CommonWell document downloader functionality in the Metriport core package. The tests cover various aspects of document downloading, parsing, and storage, focusing on the `DocumentDownloaderLambda` and `DocumentDownloaderLocal` classes.

## What does it do?
These tests ensure that the document downloading process from CommonWell Health Alliance works correctly. They verify that:

1. Documents can be downloaded from CommonWell and stored in AWS S3 buckets.
2. XML files containing embedded content (like base64 encoded documents) are correctly parsed and processed.
3. Error handling is in place for invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios.
4. The Lambda function for document downloading behaves as expected.

The tests simulate various scenarios, including different content types (PDF, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, etc.) and edge cases in XML parsing.

## Key Files

1. `document-downloader-lambda.test.ts`:
   - Tests the `DocumentDownloaderLambda` class, focusing on error handling for invalid inputs.
   - Verifies the Lambda invocation process and checks if appropriate errors are thrown.

2. `document-downloader-local.test.ts`:
   - Contains unit tests for the `DocumentDownloaderLocal` class, particularly the `parseXmlFile` method.
   - Checks various scenarios for parsing XML files with different embedded content types.

3. `document-downloader.test.ts`:
   - Tests the end-to-end process of downloading a document from CommonWell and storing it in S3.
   - Verifies the integration between CommonWell SDK, S3 utilities, and the document downloader.

## Dependencies
The tests rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. @faker-js/faker: For generating fake data in tests.
2. @metriport/commonwell-sdk: For interacting with the CommonWell Health Alliance API.
3. aws-sdk: For AWS services interaction, particularly S3.
4. Jest: As the testing framework.
5. Various internal utilities from the Metriport core package.

## Configuration
The tests use environment variables for configuration, including:

1. AWS_REGION: The AWS region for S3 and Lambda.
2. MEDICAL_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET_NAME: The S3 bucket for storing medical documents.
3. LAMBDA_NAME: The name of the Lambda function for document downloading.
4. ORG_NAME, ORG_OID, ORG_NPI: Organization details for CommonWell interactions.
5. CX_ID: Customer ID for testing.
6. CommonWell credentials and endpoints.

These variables are typically set up in the `beforeAll` or `beforeEach` blocks of the test suites.

## Error Handling
The tests include scenarios to verify error handling:

1. In `document-downloader-lambda.test.ts`, it checks if a `MetriportError` is thrown when invalid inputs are provided to the Lambda function.
2. The XML parsing tests in `document-downloader-local.test.ts` verify that the parser handles various edge cases correctly.

## Code Snippets
Here's an example of how the tests mock the S3 upload process:

```typescript
const mockUploadStream = new PassThrough();
const mockUpload = {
  promise: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({}),
};
const s3UtilsMock = {
  getUploadStreamToS3: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
    writeStream: mockUploadStream,
    upload: mockUpload,
  }),
};
```

This mock allows the tests to simulate S3 uploads without actually interacting with AWS services.

Another important aspect is the XML parsing tests, which use sample XML structures to verify correct handling:

```typescript
const xml = `
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;ClinicalDocument&gt;
    &lt;nonXmlBody&gt;
      &lt;text mediaType="text/plain" representation="B64"&gt;${b64Content}&lt;/text&gt;
    &lt;/nonXmlBody&gt;
  &lt;/ClinicalDocument&gt;
`;
```

These XML structures are used to test different scenarios in the `parseXmlFile` method.

In conclusion, these tests provide comprehensive coverage of the document downloading functionality, ensuring robustness and reliability in handling various document types and potential edge cases when interacting with CommonWell and AWS services.
