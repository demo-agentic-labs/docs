## High-level description
This code implements a `CoverageEnhancerLocal` class, which is responsible for enhancing coverage for patients in CommonWell Health Alliance. It links patients to organizations and updates their information in the system.

## Code Structure
The `CoverageEnhancerLocal` class extends the `CoverageEnhancer` base class and uses several other classes and interfaces to perform its operations, such as `LinkPatients`, `CommonWellManagementAPI`, `PatientLoader`, `PatientUpdater`, and `ECUpdater`.

## Symbols

### `CoverageEnhancerLocal`
#### Description
This class implements the Enhanced Coverage flow with logic running in a local environment. It handles the process of linking patients to organizations and updating their information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cwManagementApi | CommonWellManagementAPI | API for CommonWell management operations |
| patientLoader | PatientLoader | Loader for patient data |
| patientUpdater | PatientUpdater | Updater for patient data |
| ecUpdater | ECUpdater | Updater for Enhanced Coverage data |
| capture | Capture | Optional capture mechanism for errors and messages |
| prefix | string | Optional prefix for logging |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the `LinkPatients` instance with the provided dependencies.
2. Implements the `enhanceCoverage` method, which:
   - Generates or uses a provided Enhanced Coverage ID (ecId).
   - Retrieves Carequality organizations.
   - Logs information about the process.
   - Retrieves the original include list for the organization.
   - Processes organizations in chunks, linking patients to each chunk.
   - Handles errors during the process, optionally stopping on errors.
   - Reverts the include list to the original one after processing.
   - Logs the duration of the patient linking process.

#### Performance Considerations
- The code processes organizations in chunks to handle API limitations (50 orgs per request).
- Error handling allows for continuing the process even if some chunks fail, unless `stopOnErrors` is set to true.

### `enhanceCoverage`
#### Description
This method performs the main Enhanced Coverage flow, linking patients to organizations and updating their information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ecId | string | Optional Enhanced Coverage ID |
| cxId | string | Customer ID |
| orgOID | string | Organization OID |
| patientIds | string[] | Array of patient IDs |
| fromOrgChunkPos | number | Starting position for org chunks |
| stopOnErrors | boolean | Whether to stop on errors |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ecId | string | The Enhanced Coverage ID used or generated |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves Carequality organizations.
2. Processes organizations in chunks.
3. Links patients to organizations using the `LinkPatients` instance.
4. Handles errors during the process.
5. Reverts the include list to the original one after processing.
6. Logs the duration of the patient linking process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dayjs | Date and time manipulation |
| PatientLoader | Loading patient data |
| PatientUpdater | Updating patient data |
| Capture | Error and message capturing |
| CommonWellManagementAPI | Interacting with CommonWell API |
| LinkPatients | Linking patients to organizations |
| ECUpdater | Updating Enhanced Coverage data |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling within the `enhanceCoverage` method. It captures errors during the processing of each organization chunk and can either continue or stop the process based on the `stopOnErrors` parameter.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging mechanism with a configurable prefix. It logs information about the process, including the number of organizations, patient IDs, and duration of the operation.
