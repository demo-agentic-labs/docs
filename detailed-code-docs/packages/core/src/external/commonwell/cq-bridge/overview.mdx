## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the CommonWell Query Bridge (CQ Bridge) functionality within the core package of the application. It provides classes and utilities for enhancing coverage of patient data across different healthcare organizations, managing CommonWell Health Alliance integrations, and handling organization data retrieval and processing.

## What does it do?
The CQ Bridge functionality in this directory performs several key tasks:

1. Coverage Enhancement: It implements a process to enhance the coverage of patient data across different healthcare organizations. This involves linking patients to various Carequality organizations and updating their information in the system.

2. Organization Management: The code provides utilities for retrieving, filtering, and prioritizing healthcare organizations. It can group organizations by priority (high, medium, low) and create chunks of organizations for efficient processing.

3. Patient Linking: It implements both local and cloud-based methods for linking patients to organizations. The cloud-based method uses AWS Lambda and SQS for distributed processing.

4. Data Updates: The code includes mechanisms for updating Enhanced Coverage (EC) information after include list and document query operations.

5. API Integration: It provides classes for interacting with external APIs, such as the CommonWell Management API and a custom API for updating EC information.

These functionalities work together to improve the breadth and depth of patient data available to the system by leveraging the CommonWell Health Alliance network and Carequality framework.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this functionality are:

1. `coverage-enhancer.ts`: Defines the abstract `CoverageEnhancer` class, which serves as the base for both local and cloud-based coverage enhancement implementations.

2. `coverage-enhancer-local.ts`: Implements the `CoverageEnhancerLocal` class for local processing of coverage enhancement.

3. `coverage-enhancer-cloud.ts`: Implements the `CoverageEnhancerCloud` class for cloud-based processing using AWS services.

4. `get-orgs.ts`: Provides functions for retrieving and managing organization data, which is used by the coverage enhancers.

The flow of control typically starts with one of the coverage enhancer classes, which then use the organization retrieval functions and other utilities to perform their tasks.

## Key Files

1. `coverage-enhancer.ts`:
   - Defines the abstract `CoverageEnhancer` class with core functionality for enhancing coverage.
   - Provides methods for retrieving and filtering organizations based on various criteria.

2. `coverage-enhancer-local.ts`:
   - Implements `CoverageEnhancerLocal` for local processing of coverage enhancement.
   - Handles the process of linking patients to organizations and updating their information.

3. `coverage-enhancer-cloud.ts`:
   - Implements `CoverageEnhancerCloud` for cloud-based processing using AWS Lambda and SQS.
   - Manages the distribution of work across multiple Lambda functions for scalability.

4. `get-orgs.ts`:
   - Provides functions for retrieving and managing Care Quality (CQ) organizations.
   - Includes utilities for grouping organizations by priority and chunking data for efficient processing.

5. `ec-updater-api.ts`:
   - Defines the `ECUpdaterAPI` class for updating Enhanced Coverage information via API calls.

6. `cq-link-patients.ts`:
   - Defines types for the patient linking process, used by the coverage enhancers.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. AWS SDK: Used for interacting with AWS services like SQS in the cloud-based implementation.
2. axios: Used for making HTTP requests in the API-based EC updater.
3. dayjs: Used for date and time manipulation.
4. lodash: Used for various utility functions like chunking and grouping.
5. @metriport/shared: Provides shared types and utilities.

Internal dependencies include various patient-related classes and utilities, as well as AWS service wrappers.

## Configuration
The code uses several configuration settings and constants:

1. `defaultMaxOrgsToProcess`: Defines the default maximum number of organizations to process (400).
2. `CQ_ORG_CHUNK_SIZE`: Defines the default chunk size for processing organizations.
3. Various API endpoints and queue URLs are used in the cloud-based and API-based implementations.

This CQ Bridge functionality plays a crucial role in expanding the coverage of patient data across different healthcare organizations, leveraging the CommonWell Health Alliance network to provide a more comprehensive view of patient information.
