## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `makeSimpleOrg` for creating mock CQOrgHydrated objects. It's primarily used for testing purposes, generating fake organization data with customizable properties.

## Symbols

### `makeSimpleOrg`
#### Description
This function creates a mock CQOrgHydrated object with optional customization. It uses the Faker library to generate random data for various fields when not explicitly provided.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| p | Partial&lt;CQOrgHydrated&gt; & \{ mockStates?: string[]; amountOfStates?: number; \} | An optional object to partially override default values and provide additional configuration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| CQOrgHydrated | object | A mock CQOrgHydrated object with generated or provided data |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the spread operator to merge default values with any provided overrides.
2. It generates a random UUID for the `id` if not provided.
3. It creates a random word for the `name` if not provided.
4. For `states`, it either uses the provided states or generates a random number of unique states (between 1 and 5 by default).
   - If `mockStates` is provided, it selects from this array; otherwise, it generates random US state names.
5. It generates a random word for the `gateway` if not provided.
6. It sets the `prio` value if provided.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate fake data for testing |
| lodash | Used for the `uniq` function to ensure unique state names |

## References
- `CQOrgHydrated`: This type is imported from "../get-orgs" and represents the structure of a hydrated CQ organization object.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses `uniq` from lodash to ensure unique state names, which may have a slight performance impact for large numbers of states. However, this is unlikely to be a concern in typical testing scenarios.

## Usage in Tests
This utility function is used in various test files to create mock CQOrgHydrated objects. For example:
1. In "organization.test.ts", it's used to create mock organizations for testing the `initCQOrgIncludeList` function.
2. In "coverate-enhancer.test.ts", it's used extensively to create mock organizations with different priorities and states for testing the CoverageEnhancer class.

These tests demonstrate how `makeSimpleOrg` can be used to create both simple and complex mock data scenarios, allowing for thorough testing of functions that deal with CQ organizations.
