## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `CoverageEnhancer` class, specifically testing the `getOrgsBy` and `getOrgsForPatients` methods. The tests ensure that the class correctly filters and retrieves organizations based on various criteria such as priority, state, and gateway.

## Code Structure
The file defines a `CoverageEnhancerLocal` class that extends `CoverageEnhancer` for testing purposes. It then contains two main test suites: one for `getOrgsBy` and another for `getOrgsForPatients`. Each suite includes multiple test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

## References
- `CoverageEnhancer` from "../coverage-enhancer"
- `CQOrgHydrated`, `isLowPrio`, `isMediumPrio`, `OrgPrio` from "../get-orgs"
- `makeSimpleOrg` from "./cq-orgs"
- `PatientLoaderMetriportAPI` from "../../../../command/patient-loader-metriport-api"
- `USState` from "@metriport/shared"

## Symbols

### `CoverageEnhancerLocal`
#### Description
A local extension of the `CoverageEnhancer` class for testing purposes. It overrides some methods to allow for easier testing.

#### Internal Logic
- Overrides `enhanceCoverage` to throw an error (not implemented)
- Overrides `getOrgsForPatients` and `getOrgsBy` to call the super methods

### `describe("getOrgsBy", ...)`
#### Description
A test suite for the `getOrgsBy` method of `CoverageEnhancer`.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up test data with various organizations
- Tests different scenarios:
  - Getting all organizations
  - Filtering by gateway
  - Filtering by state
  - Filtering by both gateway and state
  - Excluding already included organizations

### `describe("getOrgsForPatients", ...)`
#### Description
A test suite for the `getOrgsForPatients` method of `CoverageEnhancer`.

#### Internal Logic
- Mocks the `getStatesFromPatientIds` method of `PatientLoaderMetriportAPI`
- Tests various scenarios:
  - Getting all medium priority organizations
  - Handling cases where there are more organizations than the allowed limit
  - Getting low priority organizations by state
  - Combining medium and low priority organizations within the limit
  - Handling cases with fewer matching low priority organizations than available spots

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Generating fake data for tests |
| @metriport/shared | Importing USState enum |
| jest | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's assertion methods to check for expected outcomes. Errors are implicitly handled by the testing framework.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use a `defaultMaxOrgsToProcess` constant to limit the number of organizations processed, which is important for performance in the actual implementation.
