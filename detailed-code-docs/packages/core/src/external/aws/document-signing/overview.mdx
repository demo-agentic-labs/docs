## High-level description
This directory contains code for implementing a bulk document signing process for AWS S3, specifically designed for handling patient and customer-related documents. The code provides both local and Lambda-based implementations for document signing, along with utility functions for searching documents, generating signed URLs, and sending results to an API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables bulk signing of documents stored in AWS S3 buckets. Here's a simplified explanation of the workflow:

1. A request is made to sign documents for a specific patient and customer.
2. The system searches for relevant documents in the S3 bucket.
3. For each document found, it generates a signed URL that allows temporary access to the document.
4. The system then compiles information about these documents, including their metadata and signed URLs.
5. Finally, it sends this compiled information to an API endpoint, which can then be used to trigger further actions or notifications.

This process can be performed either locally or using an AWS Lambda function, depending on the specific implementation chosen.

## Key Files

1. `bulk-sign.ts`: This file contains the core functionality for searching documents, generating signed URLs, and sending results to an API. It includes the main function `searchDocumentsSignUrlsAndSendToApi` which orchestrates the entire process.

2. `document-bulk-signer-lambda.ts`: Implements the `DocumentBulkSignerLambda` class, which uses an AWS Lambda function to perform the bulk document signing process.

3. `document-bulk-signer-local.ts`: Implements the `DocumentBulkSignerLocal` class, which performs the bulk document signing process locally using the functions from `bulk-sign.ts`.

4. `document-bulk-signer.ts`: Defines the abstract `DocumentBulkSigner` class and `DocumentBulkSignerRequest` type, which serve as the foundation for the Lambda and local implementations.

5. `document-bulk-signer-response.ts`: Defines schemas and types for the response of the document bulk signer, using the Zod library for schema validation.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and AWS services:

1. AWS SDK: Used for interacting with AWS services like S3 and Lambda.
2. axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
3. dayjs: Date and time manipulation library.
4. zod: Schema definition and validation library.
5. @metriport/shared: Provides utility functions for error handling and network retries.
6. @metriport/api-sdk: Imports schemas and types related to document references.

## Configuration
The code uses several configuration parameters:

- AWS region
- S3 bucket name
- Lambda function name (for Lambda implementation)
- API URL for sending results

These parameters are typically provided when initializing the document signer classes or calling the main functions.

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling throughout the process. In the main `searchDocumentsSignUrlsAndSendToApi` function, errors are caught, logged, and a failure status is sent to the API. The Lambda implementation also includes error handling during the function invocation.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses `Promise.all` for parallel processing of document URLs, which can improve performance when dealing with multiple documents. However, for very large numbers of documents, this approach might need to be optimized to avoid overwhelming the system.

In summary, this directory provides a flexible and robust solution for bulk document signing, with options for both local and Lambda-based processing, making it suitable for various deployment scenarios and scalability requirements.
