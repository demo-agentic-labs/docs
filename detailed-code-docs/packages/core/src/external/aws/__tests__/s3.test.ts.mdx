## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the S3Utils class and the splitS3Location function from the AWS S3 utility module. The tests cover various scenarios for retrieving file information from S3 and parsing S3 location strings.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into two main describe blocks: one for S3Utils (with a skipped integration test) and another for the splitS3Location function. Each describe block contains multiple test cases that verify different aspects of the functionality.

## Symbols

### `describe("S3Utils")`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the S3Utils class, including a skipped integration test for the getFileInfoFromS3 method.

#### Internal Logic
- Skips the integration test for getFileInfoFromS3
- Tests two scenarios: one for a non-existing file and another for an existing file

### `describe("splitS3Location")`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the splitS3Location function, which parses S3 location strings.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests various scenarios for parsing S3 location strings:
  1. Invalid location without server URL
  2. Invalid location without key
  3. Valid location with a single key
  4. Valid location with a longer key (multiple path segments)

### `it("returns undefined if it gets a location without server url")`
#### Description
Tests the splitS3Location function with an invalid input that lacks a server URL.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Define a key without a server URL
- Act: Call splitS3Location with the invalid input
- Assert: Expect the result to be falsy

### `it("returns undefined if it gets a location without key")`
#### Description
Tests the splitS3Location function with an invalid input that lacks a key.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Define a location with only a bucket name and no key
- Act: Call splitS3Location with the invalid input
- Assert: Expect the result to be falsy

### `it("returns bucketName and key when it gets a valid S3 location with single key")`
#### Description
Tests the splitS3Location function with a valid S3 location containing a single key.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Define a valid S3 location with a bucket name and a single key
- Act: Call splitS3Location with the valid input
- Assert: Expect the result to be truthy and contain the correct bucket name and key

### `it("returns bucketName and key when it gets a valid S3 location with longer key")`
#### Description
Tests the splitS3Location function with a valid S3 location containing a longer key (multiple path segments).

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Define a valid S3 location with a bucket name and a longer key
- Act: Call splitS3Location with the valid input
- Assert: Expect the result to be truthy and contain the correct bucket name and key

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| S3Utils | Class being tested for S3 operations |
| splitS3Location | Function being tested for parsing S3 location strings |

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's expect assertions to verify the correctness of the results. No specific error handling mechanisms are implemented in the test file itself.
