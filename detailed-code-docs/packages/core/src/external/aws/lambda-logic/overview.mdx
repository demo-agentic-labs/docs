## High-level description
This directory contains AWS Lambda functions and related logic for processing and handling medical records, specifically FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) bundles. The code is responsible for converting FHIR bundles into various formats such as brief summaries, HTML representations, and handling document uploads. It integrates with AWS services like S3 and Bedrock, and includes functionality for data deduplication, AI-powered brief generation, and ADHD-specific medical record processing.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key functions:

1. Converts FHIR bundles to brief summaries: It processes medical data, potentially deduplicates it, and uses AI (via AWS Bedrock) to generate concise summaries of patient records.

2. Generates HTML representations of medical records: It takes FHIR bundles and creates structured HTML documents that organize various types of medical information (e.g., medications, conditions, allergies) into readable sections.

3. Handles ADHD-specific medical record processing: There's specialized functionality for creating HTML representations tailored to ADHD-related medical information.

4. Manages document uploads: It processes uploaded medical documents, copies them to appropriate S3 buckets, updates metadata, and manages document references in a FHIR server.

5. Provides utility functions: The code includes various helper functions for date formatting, code handling, and HTML generation that are used across different parts of the system.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `bundleToBrief` in `bundle-to-brief.ts`: This function is the primary entry point for converting FHIR bundles to brief summaries.

2. `bundleToHtml` in `bundle-to-html.ts` and `bundleToHtmlNoDedup` in `bundle-to-html-no-dedup.ts`: These functions are responsible for converting FHIR bundles to HTML representations of medical records.

3. `bundleToHtmlADHD` in `bundle-to-html-adhd.ts`: This function specifically handles the conversion of FHIR bundles to HTML for ADHD-related medical records.

4. `documentUploaderHandler` in `document-uploader.ts`: This is the main handler for processing document uploads and managing their storage and references.

The data flow typically starts with a FHIR bundle input, which is then processed through these functions to produce various outputs (briefs, HTML representations, or updated document references). The control flow is largely determined by the specific Lambda function being invoked, which then calls the appropriate entry point function.

## Key Files
1. `bundle-to-brief.ts`: Handles the conversion of FHIR bundles to brief summaries, including AI-powered brief generation.

2. `bundle-to-html.ts` and `bundle-to-html-no-dedup.ts`: Responsible for converting FHIR bundles to HTML representations of medical records.

3. `bundle-to-html-adhd.ts`: Specializes in creating HTML representations for ADHD-related medical records.

4. `bundle-to-html-shared.ts`: Contains shared utility functions and types used across different HTML generation processes.

5. `document-uploader.ts`: Manages the document upload process, including S3 interactions and document reference updates.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and AWS services:

1. AWS SDK: For interacting with AWS services like S3 and Bedrock.
2. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources.
3. dayjs: Used for date manipulation and formatting.
4. lodash: Provides utility functions, particularly for data manipulation.
5. axios: Used for making HTTP requests to external APIs.

## Configuration
The code uses various configuration settings, including:

1. AWS region and service endpoints.
2. S3 bucket names for source and destination of uploaded documents.
3. API server URLs for updating document references.
4. Bedrock model IDs and versions for AI-powered brief generation.
5. Various coding systems constants for processing medical codes (e.g., RX_NORM_CODE, SNOMED_CODE, ICD_10_CODE).

These configurations are typically passed as environment variables or function parameters.

The code in this directory forms a crucial part of a larger system for processing and managing medical records, providing functionality to transform raw FHIR data into more accessible and useful formats for both programmatic and human consumption.
