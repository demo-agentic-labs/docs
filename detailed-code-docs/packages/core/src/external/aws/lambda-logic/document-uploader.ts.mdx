## High-level description
This code implements a document uploader handler for AWS Lambda, which processes uploaded files, copies them to a destination bucket, and updates document references in a FHIR server. It handles file metadata, error handling, and integrates with various AWS services and internal APIs.

## Code Structure
The main function `documentUploaderHandler` orchestrates the entire process, utilizing helper functions and external services. It interacts with S3, makes API calls, and manages file metadata and document references.

## Symbols

### `documentUploaderHandler`
#### Description
This is the main function that handles the document upload process. It copies the file from the source bucket to the destination bucket, updates file metadata, and creates or updates a document reference in the FHIR server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sourceBucket | string | The name of the source S3 bucket |
| sourceKey | string | The key of the uploaded file in the source bucket |
| destinationBucket | string | The name of the destination S3 bucket |
| region | string | The AWS region |
| apiServerURL | string | The URL of the API server for updating document references |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | void \| \{ message: string; size: number \} | Undefined if successful, or an object with a message and file size if the file exceeds the maximum allowed size |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parse the source key to extract customer ID, patient ID, and document ID
2. Get file information from S3
3. Create a new file name and metadata file name
4. Copy the file to the destination bucket
5. Prepare file data for the API call
6. Forward the call to the server to update the document reference
7. Create and upload document metadata file
8. Check if the file size exceeds the maximum allowed size

### `forwardCallToServer`
#### Description
This function makes an API call to update the document reference on the server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | Customer ID |
| apiServerURL | string | The URL of the API server |
| fileData | FileData | File metadata information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| docRef | DocumentReference \| undefined | The updated document reference or undefined if the call fails |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | For FHIR type definitions |
| @metriport/shared | For utility functions |
| axios | For making HTTP requests |
| S3Utils | For interacting with AWS S3 |

## Error Handling
The code uses try-catch blocks to handle errors at various stages of the process. It logs errors and throws `MetriportError` instances with contextual information for better debugging and error reporting.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses `executeWithRetries` and `executeWithNetworkRetries` functions to handle potential network issues and improve reliability when interacting with external services like S3 and the API server.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment (#1207) mentioning the need to delete the file if it's too large and alert the customer.
