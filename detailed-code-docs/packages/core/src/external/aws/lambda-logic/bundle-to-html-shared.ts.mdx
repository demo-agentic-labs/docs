## High-level description
This code defines utility functions and types for processing and formatting FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data, specifically focusing on bundling diagnostic reports into HTML sections. It's part of a larger system for generating medical record summaries.

## Code Structure
The file exports several functions and constants that are used to process and format FHIR data. The main functions are `formatDateForDisplay` and `buildEncounterSections`, which work with dates and diagnostic reports respectively. These functions are likely used by other parts of the system to generate HTML representations of medical records.

## Symbols

### `ISO_DATE`
#### Description
A constant string representing the format for ISO dates.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ISO_DATE | string | The string "YYYY-MM-DD" |

### `MISSING_DATE_KEY`
#### Description
A constant string used as a key when a date is missing.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| MISSING_DATE_KEY | string | The string "N/A" |

### `MISSING_DATE_TEXT`
#### Description
A constant string used as display text when a date is not available.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| MISSING_DATE_TEXT | string | The string "not available" |

### `formatDateForDisplay`
#### Description
A function that formats a date for display. It can handle both Date objects and strings.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date \| string \| undefined | The date to format |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| formattedDate | string | The formatted date string |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the dayjs library to format the date. If the input is a string, it's parsed directly. If it's a Date object, it's converted to an ISO string first. The result is formatted according to the ISO_DATE constant.

### `buildEncounterSections`
#### Description
A function that builds encounter sections from diagnostic reports.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| encounterSections | EncounterSection | Existing encounter sections |
| diagnosticReports | DiagnosticReport[] | Array of diagnostic reports |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| updatedEncounterSections | EncounterSection | Updated encounter sections |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through the diagnostic reports, organizing them into encounter sections based on their dates. It handles missing dates, categorizes reports (e.g., labs, documentation), and checks for duplicates. The function builds a structured object where each date contains categorized diagnostic reports.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| dayjs | Used for date manipulation and formatting |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It uses optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle potential undefined values.

## Performance Considerations
The `buildEncounterSections` function iterates through all diagnostic reports, which could be performance-intensive for large datasets. It also performs nested iterations when checking for duplicates, which might impact performance for large numbers of reports.

This code is part of a larger system for processing and displaying medical records. It provides essential utilities for date formatting and organizing diagnostic reports into a structured format suitable for HTML generation.
