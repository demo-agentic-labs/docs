## High-level description
This code is responsible for converting a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) bundle into an HTML representation of a medical record summary. It includes functionality for deduplication, generating an AI-powered brief summary, and handling various resource types such as conditions, medications, observations, and more.

## Code Structure
The main function `bundleToHtml` takes a FHIR bundle and an optional brief summary as input, and returns an HTML string. It extracts different resource types from the bundle, processes them, and generates HTML sections for each type. The code also includes helper functions for formatting dates, handling codes, and creating HTML table structures.

## Symbols

### `bundleToHtml`
#### Description
This is the main function that converts a FHIR bundle into an HTML representation of a medical record summary.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fhirBundle | Bundle | The FHIR bundle containing patient data |
| brief | Brief (optional) | An optional AI-generated brief summary |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| htmlPage | string | The generated HTML page as a string |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts various resource types from the bundle using `extractFhirTypesFromBundle`.
2. Generates HTML sections for different resource types (e.g., medications, conditions, allergies).
3. Combines all sections into a single HTML page with styling and structure.

### `extractFhirTypesFromBundle`
#### Description
Extracts different resource types from the FHIR bundle and organizes them into separate arrays.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bundle | Bundle | The FHIR bundle to extract resources from |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extractedResources | Object | An object containing arrays of different resource types |

### `createMedicationSection`
#### Description
Generates the HTML section for medications.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| medications | Medication[] | Array of medication resources |
| medicationStatements | MedicationStatement[] | Array of medication statement resources |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| htmlSection | string | The generated HTML section for medications |

### `createConditionSection`
#### Description
Generates the HTML section for conditions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditions | Condition[] | Array of condition resources |
| encounter | Encounter[] | Array of encounter resources |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| htmlSection | string | The generated HTML section for conditions |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| dayjs | Used for date manipulation and formatting |
| lodash | Utility functions, specifically `uniqWith` for deduplication |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, such as throwing an error when no patient is found in the bundle. However, most of the error handling is implicit, relying on optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators to handle missing or undefined data.

## Performance Considerations
The code processes large amounts of data and generates HTML, which can be computationally intensive. It uses deduplication techniques and filtering to reduce redundant information, potentially improving performance and readability of the output.
