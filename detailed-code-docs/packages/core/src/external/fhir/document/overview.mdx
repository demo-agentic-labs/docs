## High-level description
This directory contains code related to handling FHIR DocumentReference resources within the core package. It provides functionality for creating, retrieving, and filtering DocumentReference resources, as well as utility functions and type definitions for working with these resources. The directory also includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability of the implemented functions.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves several key purposes:

1. It defines types and utility functions for working with FHIR DocumentReference resources, ensuring type safety and consistency throughout the application.

2. It provides a function to retrieve documents from a FHIR server based on various criteria such as patient ID, date range, and document IDs. This function handles the complexities of querying the FHIR server, including pagination and error handling.

3. It includes a function for generating query filters used in document retrieval, allowing for flexible and precise document searches.

4. It offers a utility function for creating mock DocumentReference resources, which is particularly useful for testing purposes.

5. It contains a comprehensive set of unit tests that verify the correct functioning of the document retrieval and filter generation logic under various scenarios.

## Key Files

### document-reference.ts
This file defines types and utility functions for working with FHIR DocumentReference resources. Key features include:

- `DocumentReferenceWithId`: A type representing a DocumentReference with a required `id` field.
- `hasId`: A type guard function to check if a DocumentReference has an `id` field.
- `isDocumentReference`: A type guard function to check if a given resource is a DocumentReference.

### get-documents.ts
This file contains the main functionality for retrieving documents from a FHIR server. Key functions include:

- `getDocuments`: Asynchronously retrieves documents based on provided parameters such as patient ID, date range, and document IDs.
- `getFilters`: Constructs URL parameters for filtering document queries.

Example usage of `getDocuments`:

```typescript
const documents = await getDocuments(
  contextId,
  patientId,
  fromDate,
  toDate,
  documentIds
);
```

### __tests__/document-reference.ts
This file provides a utility function for creating mock DocumentReference resources:

- `makeDocumentReference`: Creates a FHIR DocumentReference resource with customizable properties.

### __tests__/get-documents.test.ts
This file contains unit tests for the `getFilters` function, ensuring correct filter generation for various input scenarios.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries:

1. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources.
2. uuid: Generates unique identifiers for mock resources.
3. @faker-js/faker: Generates fake data for tests.
4. dayjs: Handles date manipulation and formatting.
5. lodash: Provides utility functions, particularly the `chunk` function for processing large arrays of document IDs.

## Configuration
The code uses configuration settings from `@metriport/core/util/config` and error capturing utilities from `@metriport/core/util/notifications`. It also uses a constant `ISO_DATE` from `@metriport/shared/common/date` for consistent date formatting.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how the `getDocuments` function is structured:

```typescript
export async function getDocuments(
  cxId: string,
  patientId: string | string[] | undefined,
  from: string | undefined,
  to: string | undefined,
  documentIds: string[]
): Promise&lt;DocumentReferenceWithId[]&gt; {
  const api = makeFhirApi(cxId);
  const chunks = chunk(documentIds, MAX_DOCUMENT_IDS_PER_REQUEST);
  const docs: DocumentReferenceWithId[] = [];

  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    try {
      const filters = getFilters({ patientId, documentIds: chunk, from, to });
      const response = await api.searchResources&lt;DocumentReference&gt;('DocumentReference', filters);
      docs.push(...response.filter(hasId));
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`Error fetching documents: ${(error as Error).message}`);
      capture.error(error, {
        extra: {
          context: 'getDocuments',
          cxId,
          patientId,
          from,
          to,
          documentIds: chunk,
        },
      });
      throw error;
    }
  }

  return docs;
}
```

This function demonstrates how the code handles document retrieval, error handling, and processing of large numbers of document IDs.

In summary, this directory provides a robust set of tools for working with FHIR DocumentReference resources, including retrieval, filtering, and testing utilities. The code is well-structured, type-safe, and thoroughly tested, ensuring reliability and ease of use within the larger application context.
