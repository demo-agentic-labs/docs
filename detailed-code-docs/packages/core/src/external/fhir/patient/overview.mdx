## High-level description
This directory contains code for handling FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) patient data within the Metriport system. It provides functionality for mapping between Metriport's internal patient representation and FHIR patient resources, as well as utilities for filtering and processing FHIR patient data.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key functions:

1. Conversion between Metriport and FHIR formats:
   - Converts Metriport gender codes to FHIR gender codes and vice versa.
   - Transforms Metriport patient data into FHIR patient resources.
   - Extracts FHIR identifiers from Metriport patient data.

2. FHIR resource filtering:
   - Generates filters for different types of FHIR resources based on input parameters.
   - Applies date filters to specific resource types.
   - Provides utilities for name-based searches on FHIR data.

3. Patient identification:
   - Creates FHIR Reference objects for patients.
   - Extracts patient IDs from FHIR DocumentReference objects.

These functionalities allow the Metriport system to interact seamlessly with FHIR-compliant systems, enabling interoperability in healthcare data exchange.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`:
   This file contains the core functionality for mapping between Metriport and FHIR patient data. It defines types, constants, and functions for converting gender codes, patient data, and identifiers. Key functions include `mapPatientDataToResource`, `toFHIR`, and `getFhirIdentifersFromPatient`.

   Example of gender code conversion:
   ```typescript
   const metriportGenderToFhir: Record&lt;MetriportGender, FhirGender&gt; = {
     F: "female",
     M: "male",
     X: "other",
     U: "unknown",
   };

   export function mapMetriportGenderToFhirGender(k: MetriportGender | undefined): FhirGender {
     return k ? metriportGenderToFhir[k] : "unknown";
   }
   ```

2. `resource-filter.ts`:
   This file provides utilities for filtering and processing FHIR patient data. It includes functions for generating resource filters, handling date queries, and performing name-based searches. The main function `getPatientFilter` is used to create filters for different FHIR resources based on input parameters.

   Example of generating a patient filter:
   ```typescript
   export function getPatientFilter(
     resources: medical.ResourceTypeForConsolidation[],
     dateFrom?: string,
     dateTo?: string
   ): { resources: medical.ResourceTypeForConsolidation[]; dateFilter: string } {
     const resourcesSearchableByPatient = intersection(resources, resourcesSearchableByPatientArray);
     const resourcesSearchableBySubject = intersection(resources, resourcesSearchableBySubjectArray);
     const dateFilter = isoDateRangeToFHIRDateQuery(dateFrom, dateTo);
     return {
       resources: [...resourcesSearchableByPatient, ...resourcesSearchableBySubject],
       dateFilter,
     };
   }
   ```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides FHIR type definitions used throughout the code.
2. @metriport/shared: Contains medical-related utilities and types specific to the Metriport system.
3. lodash: Used for utility functions like `intersection`.

These dependencies are crucial for handling FHIR data types, performing Metriport-specific operations, and utilizing common utility functions.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code uses various constants and type definitions that act as configuration settings. For example:

- `FhirGender` type: Defines the allowed gender values in FHIR patient resources.
- `metriportGenderToFhir` and `fhirGenderToMetriportGender` mappings: Configure the translation between Metriport and FHIR gender codes.
- `resourcesSearchableByPatientArray` and `resourcesSearchableBySubjectArray`: Define which FHIR resources can be searched by patient and subject, respectively.

These "configuration" elements are hardcoded in the source files but could potentially be moved to external configuration files if more flexibility is needed in the future.

In conclusion, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling Metriport to work with FHIR patient data, providing the necessary tools for data conversion, filtering, and processing. It serves as a bridge between Metriport's internal data representation and the standardized FHIR format, facilitating interoperability in healthcare data exchange.
