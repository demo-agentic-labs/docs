## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `makeBundle` that creates a FHIR Bundle resource from an array of FHIR resources. It's designed to simplify the process of creating a Bundle for transaction operations in FHIR-based applications.

## Symbols

### `makeBundle`
#### Description
The `makeBundle` function is a generic function that takes an array of FHIR resources and constructs a FHIR Bundle resource. It's designed to be flexible, working with any type of FHIR resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| entries | T[] | An array of FHIR resources of type T, where T extends Resource |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bundle | Bundle&lt;T&gt; | A FHIR Bundle resource containing the input resources |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function maps over the input `entries` array, creating a new array where each resource is wrapped in an object with a `resource` property.
2. It then constructs and returns a Bundle object with the following properties:
   - `resourceType`: Set to "Bundle"
   - `type`: Set to "transaction"
   - `entry`: The array created in step 1

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources (Bundle and Resource) |

## API/Interface Reference
| Function | Input | Output | Description |
|:---------|:------|:-------|:------------|
| makeBundle | \{ entries: T[] \} | Bundle&lt;T&gt; | Creates a FHIR Bundle resource from an array of FHIR resources |

This utility function provides a simple and type-safe way to create FHIR Bundle resources for transaction operations, which is a common requirement in FHIR-based applications.
