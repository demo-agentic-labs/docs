## High-level description
This code defines a function `getReferencesFromFHIR` that retrieves FHIR resources based on a list of references. It efficiently handles large numbers of references by grouping them by resource type and chunking them into smaller batches for parallel processing.

## Code Structure
The main function `getReferencesFromFHIR` uses helper functions like `getFilters` to prepare the search parameters. It relies on external utilities such as `executeAsynchronously` for parallel execution and `makeFhirApi` for FHIR API interactions.

## Symbols

### `getReferencesFromFHIR`
#### Description
This asynchronous function fetches FHIR resources based on a list of references. It groups references by type, chunks them into smaller batches, and processes them in parallel.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| references | Reference[] | An array of FHIR references to fetch |
| fhir | ReturnType&lt;typeof makeFhirApi&gt; | A FHIR API client instance |
| log | typeof console.log (optional) | A logging function |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resources | Resource[] | An array of fetched FHIR resources |

#### Internal Logic
1. Group references by type
2. Chunk references into smaller batches (max 150 IDs per request)
3. Consolidate chunks into an array of resource types and IDs
4. Use `executeAsynchronously` to process chunks in parallel
5. For each chunk, construct a search query and fetch resources
6. Accumulate fetched resources and return them

### `getFilters`
#### Description
A helper function that constructs URL search parameters for FHIR resource queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ids | string[] | An array of resource IDs to include in the filter |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtersAsStr | string | A URL-encoded string of search parameters |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides FHIR type definitions |
| lodash | Used for utility functions like `groupBy` and `chunk` |
| ../../../util/concurrency | Provides `executeAsynchronously` for parallel processing |
| ../api/api-factory | Provides `makeFhirApi` for creating FHIR API clients |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MAX_IDS_PER_REQUEST | number | 150 | Maximum number of IDs to include in a single FHIR request |
| queriesInParallel | number | 5 | Number of parallel queries to execute |

## Performance Considerations
The code is optimized for performance by:
1. Grouping references by type to minimize the number of API calls
2. Chunking large numbers of references into smaller batches
3. Processing chunks in parallel using `executeAsynchronously`
4. Limiting the number of IDs per request to avoid overloading the FHIR server

These optimizations allow the function to efficiently handle large numbers of references while maintaining reasonable performance.
