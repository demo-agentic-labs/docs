## High-level description
This directory contains shared utilities and functions for working with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data in the Metriport medical data integration platform. It provides essential tools for processing FHIR bundles, managing custom extensions, handling references, and performing various FHIR-related operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves several crucial functions:

1. FHIR Bundle Processing: It offers utilities for extracting references from FHIR resources, building FHIR bundles, and extracting specific resource types from bundles.

2. Custom Extensions: It defines and manages Metriport-specific FHIR extensions, such as document ID extensions and data source extensions, which are crucial for maintaining data provenance and traceability.

3. Resource Handling: It provides functions for identifying resource types, finding specific resources within bundles, and constructing references to FHIR resources.

4. Date Formatting: It includes utilities for converting between ISO date formats and FHIR date query strings.

5. Error Handling: It offers functions for processing and formatting FHIR operation outcome errors.

6. Reference Resolution: It implements efficient methods for fetching FHIR resources based on references, including optimizations for handling large numbers of references.

These functionalities are essential for integrating, processing, and managing medical data from various sources within the Metriport platform, ensuring consistency, traceability, and efficient data handling.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.ts` file, which exports a wide range of utility functions and constants used throughout the Metriport system for FHIR data processing. Key functionalities include:

- Error handling (`operationOutcomeIssueToString`, `getDetailFromOutcomeError`)
- Resource type checking (`isLocation`, `isPatient`, etc.)
- Date formatting for FHIR queries (`isoDateRangeToFHIRDateQuery`)
- Resource finding within bundles (`findOrganizationResource`, `findCompositionResource`, etc.)

The `bundle.ts` file provides functions for working with FHIR bundles, including:
- `getReferencesFromResources` and `getReferencesFromRaw` for extracting references
- `buildBundle` for constructing FHIR bundles
- `extractFhirTypesFromBundle` for organizing resources by type

The `references.ts` file contains the `getReferencesFromFHIR` function, which efficiently fetches FHIR resources based on a list of references, optimized for handling large numbers of references.

The `extensions` directory defines custom FHIR extensions used by Metriport, with `metriport.ts` containing Metriport-specific extensions and utility functions.

## Key Files
1. `index.ts`: The main export file containing a wide range of FHIR utility functions.
2. `bundle.ts`: Provides functions for processing FHIR bundles and extracting references.
3. `references.ts`: Contains optimized functions for fetching FHIR resources based on references.
4. `extensions/`: A directory containing definitions and utilities for custom FHIR extensions:
   - `base-extension.ts`: Defines the base URL for Metriport FHIR extensions.
   - `doc-id-extension.ts`: Implements the document ID extension.
   - `extension.ts`: Defines constants for data source and operation outcome extensions.
   - `metriport.ts`: Contains Metriport-specific extensions and utility functions.
5. `namespaces.ts`: Defines the `IETF_URI` constant used in FHIR implementations.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily depends on the following external libraries:

1. `@medplum/fhirtypes` and `@medplum/core`: Provide FHIR type definitions and core functionalities.
2. `lodash`: Used for various utility functions.
3. `dayjs`: Used for date manipulation.
4. `ts-essentials`: Offers utility types for TypeScript.

Internal dependencies include custom modules for handling extensions, API interactions, and concurrency utilities.

## Configuration
Key configuration elements include:

1. The base URL for Metriport FHIR extensions: `BASE_EXTENSION_URL = "https://metriport.com/fhir/StructureDefinition"`
2. Performance optimizations in `references.ts`:
   - `MAX_IDS_PER_REQUEST = 150`: Maximum number of IDs to include in a single FHIR request.
   - `queriesInParallel = 5`: Number of parallel queries to execute when fetching resources.

These shared utilities and configurations play a crucial role in maintaining consistency, efficiency, and proper handling of FHIR data across the Metriport platform. They provide a foundation for processing medical data from various sources while ensuring data integrity and traceability.
