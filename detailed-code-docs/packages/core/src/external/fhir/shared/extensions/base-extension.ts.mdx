## References
The `BASE_EXTENSION_URL` is referenced in other parts of the codebase, specifically in the following files:

1. `packages/core/src/external/fhir/shared/extensions/extension.ts`
2. `packages/core/src/external/fhir/shared/extensions/doc-id-extension.ts`

These files use the `BASE_EXTENSION_URL` to create specific extension URLs for different purposes.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a simple constant declaration.

## Usage in Related Files

### In `extension.ts`:
The `BASE_EXTENSION_URL` is used to create two specific extension URLs:

1. `DATA_SOURCE_EXTENSION_URL`: For a data source extension
2. `OPERATION_OUTCOME_EXTENSION_URL`: For an operation outcome extension

It's also used in defining default values for the data source extension.

### In `doc-id-extension.ts`:
The `BASE_EXTENSION_URL` is used to create a document ID extension URL (`DOC_ID_EXTENSION_URL`). This file also defines a type `DocIdExtension` and a function `buildDocIdFhirExtension` to create a FHIR extension for document IDs.

## TODOs
There are TODOs mentioned in both related files (TODO #712) indicating that these extensions need to be created. This suggests that the extensions are currently placeholders and may require further implementation or documentation in the future.
