## High-level description
This directory contains code related to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) extensions used in the Metriport medical data integration platform. It defines custom extensions for document IDs, data sources, and operation outcomes, as well as utility functions for handling Metriport-specific FHIR data.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves several purposes:

1. It establishes a base URL for Metriport's custom FHIR extensions, ensuring consistency across the system.
2. It defines a document ID extension, which is used to link FHIR resources back to their source documents.
3. It creates data source extensions, allowing the system to track the origin of FHIR resources (e.g., Metriport, Carequality, or CommonWell).
4. It provides utility functions to identify and retrieve Metriport-specific content from FHIR resources.

These extensions and utilities are crucial for maintaining traceability and provenance of medical data within the Metriport system, especially when dealing with data from multiple sources.

## Key Files

1. `base-extension.ts`: Defines the base URL for all Metriport FHIR extensions.
2. `doc-id-extension.ts`: Implements the document ID extension and provides a function to build this extension.
3. `extension.ts`: Defines constants and default values for data source and operation outcome extensions.
4. `metriport.ts`: Contains Metriport-specific extensions and utility functions for handling Metriport data sources.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily depends on the following external libraries:

1. `@medplum/fhirtypes`: Provides FHIR type definitions used throughout the code.
2. `ts-essentials`: Offers utility types for TypeScript.

These dependencies are chosen to ensure type safety and adherence to FHIR standards in the implementation of custom extensions.

## Configuration
The main configuration in this directory is the `BASE_EXTENSION_URL` constant defined in `base-extension.ts`. This URL forms the foundation for all Metriport-specific FHIR extensions:

```typescript
export const BASE_EXTENSION_URL = "https://metriport.com/fhir/StructureDefinition";
```

This base URL is used to construct specific extension URLs, such as:

```typescript
const DATA_SOURCE_EXTENSION_URL = `${BASE_EXTENSION_URL}/data-source.json`;
const OPERATION_OUTCOME_EXTENSION_URL = `${BASE_EXTENSION_URL}/operation-outcome`;
const DOC_ID_EXTENSION_URL = `${BASE_EXTENSION_URL}/doc-id-extension.json`;
```

These extension URLs are crucial for maintaining consistency and uniqueness in the custom FHIR extensions used throughout the Metriport system.

The `metriport.ts` file also defines a Metriport-specific data source extension:

```typescript
export const metriportDataSourceExtension: MetriportDataSourceExtension = {
  ...dataSourceExtensionDefaults,
  valueCoding: {
    ...dataSourceExtensionDefaults.valueCoding,
    code: METRIPORT,
  },
};
```

This extension is used to identify FHIR resources that originate from Metriport's own systems.

It's worth noting that there are TODO comments (TODO #712) in the code indicating that some of these extensions still need to be fully implemented or documented. This suggests that the extension system is still evolving and may be subject to future changes or enhancements.

The utility functions in `metriport.ts`, such as `isMetriportExtension`, `isMetriportContent`, and `getMetriportContent`, provide a way to interact with these custom extensions and identify Metriport-specific data within FHIR resources. For example:

```typescript
export function isMetriportContent(content: DocumentReferenceContent): boolean {
  return (
    content.extension?.some(isMetriportExtension) ||
    (!isCommonWellContent(content) && !isCarequalityContent(content))
  );
}
```

This function checks if a given `DocumentReferenceContent` is Metriport content by looking for the Metriport extension or by process of elimination (i.e., it's not CommonWell or Carequality content).

These extensions and utility functions play a crucial role in the Metriport system's ability to handle and differentiate between various data sources, maintain data provenance, and ensure proper handling of Metriport-specific FHIR resources.
