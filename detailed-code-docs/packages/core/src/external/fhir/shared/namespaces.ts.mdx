## High-level description
This code defines a constant `IETF_URI` which represents a specific URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) used in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) implementations. The URI is based on the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) RFC 3986 standard.

## Symbols

### `IETF_URI`
#### Description
`IETF_URI` is a constant string that represents the URI "urn:ietf:rfc:3986". This URI is commonly used in FHIR implementations to identify certain types of resources or identifiers.

#### Inputs
None (it's a constant)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| IETF_URI | string | The constant string "urn:ietf:rfc:3986" |

## References
The `IETF_URI` constant is referenced in other parts of the codebase, specifically:

1. In `packages/api/src/command/medical/admin/upload-doc.ts`, it's used to set the `system` property of `masterIdentifier` and `identifier` objects in a `DocumentReference` resource.

2. In `packages/api/src/external/fhir/document/draft-update-document-reference.ts`, it's used in the `getMasterIdentifier` function to set the `system` property of the returned `Identifier` object.

These usages indicate that `IETF_URI` is primarily used as a standard identifier system in FHIR-related operations, particularly when dealing with document references and identifiers.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a simple constant declaration.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a simple constant declaration, there are no significant performance considerations. The constant can be efficiently accessed and used throughout the application without any computational overhead.
