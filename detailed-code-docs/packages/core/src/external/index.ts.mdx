## High-level description
This file defines an enum `MedicalDataSource` for different medical data sources, a function `isMedicalDataSource` to check if a string is a valid medical data source, and constants related to HL7 OIDs and medical data source OIDs. It serves as a central place for defining and validating medical data sources used across the application.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in the code are:
- `MedicalDataSource`: An enum of medical data sources
- `isMedicalDataSource`: A function to validate medical data sources
- `HL7OID`: A constant string for the HL7 OID
- `MedicalDataSourceOid`: A record mapping valid medical data sources to their OIDs
