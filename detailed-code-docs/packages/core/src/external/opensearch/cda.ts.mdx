## High-level description
This code defines two arrays of stop words: `genericStopWords` and `htmlStopWords`. These arrays contain common words or HTML tags that are typically excluded from text analysis or processing, particularly in the context of search indexing or natural language processing tasks.

## Symbols

### `genericStopWords`
#### Description
An array containing a single string "nullFlavor", which is likely a specific term used in the context of the application that should be ignored during text processing.

#### Inputs
None (it's a constant array)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| genericStopWords | string[] | An array containing one string: "nullFlavor" |

### `htmlStopWords`
#### Description
An array containing common HTML tags that are typically not meaningful for text analysis and should be removed or ignored during processing.

#### Inputs
None (it's a constant array)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| htmlStopWords | string[] | An array of strings representing common HTML tags |

## References
This code is referenced in the related file `packages/core/src/external/opensearch/file-ingestor-direct.ts`. Specifically:

1. The `genericStopWords` array is used to create a regular expression `regexGenericWords` for removing these words from text.
2. The `htmlStopWords` array is used to create a regular expression `regexHTML` for removing HTML tags from text.

These arrays play a crucial role in the text cleaning process implemented in the `cleanUpContents` method of the `OpenSearchFileIngestorDirect` class.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Performance Considerations
The use of these predefined arrays for stop words and HTML tags can improve performance in text processing tasks by allowing for efficient creation of regular expressions for text cleaning. This approach avoids the need to repeatedly define these common elements in multiple places throughout the codebase.
