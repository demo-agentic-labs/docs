## Error Handling
The class uses try-catch blocks and logging to handle errors during file retrieval, content processing, and OpenSearch interactions.

## Performance Considerations
- The class uses regular expressions for content cleanup, which may impact performance for very large files
- Retries are implemented for OpenSearch interactions to handle potential network issues or temporary failures
