## High-level description
This file defines factory functions for creating OpenSearch file ingestors and searchers. It provides a way to create instances of these services based on the current configuration, supporting both development and production environments.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main functions: `makeSearchServiceIngest()` and `makeSearchServiceQuery()`. These functions use configuration values to create and return instances of OpenSearch file ingestors and searchers, respectively.

## Symbols

### `makeSearchServiceIngest()`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an instance of `OpenSearchFileIngestor` based on the current configuration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | OpenSearchFileIngestor | An instance of OpenSearchFileIngestor |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves configuration values using the `Config` utility.
2. If the environment is development (isDev()), it returns an instance of `OpenSearchFileIngestorDirect`.
3. Otherwise, it returns an instance of `OpenSearchFileIngestorSQS`.

### `makeSearchServiceQuery()`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an instance of `OpenSearchFileSearcher` based on the current configuration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | OpenSearchFileSearcher | An instance of OpenSearchFileSearcher |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves configuration values using the `Config` utility.
2. Creates and returns an instance of `OpenSearchFileSearcherDirect`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| OpenSearchFileIngestor | Abstract class for file ingestion |
| OpenSearchFileIngestorDirect | Direct file ingestion implementation |
| OpenSearchFileIngestorSQS | SQS-based file ingestion implementation |
| OpenSearchFileSearcher | Interface for file searching |
| OpenSearchFileSearcherDirect | Direct file searching implementation |
| Config | Utility for retrieving configuration values |

## Configuration
The following configuration options are used:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region |
| SEARCH_ENDPOINT | string | OpenSearch endpoint |
| SEARCH_INDEX_NAME | string | OpenSearch index name |
| SEARCH_USERNAME | string | OpenSearch username |
| SEARCH_PASSWORD | string | OpenSearch password |
| SEARCH_INGESTION_QUEUE_URL | string | SQS queue URL for ingestion (production only) |

## Error Handling
This file does not implement specific error handling. Errors would be propagated from the instantiated classes.

## Performance Considerations
The factory functions are designed to create appropriate instances based on the environment (development or production). In production, the ingestion process uses SQS, which can help with scalability and reliability.
