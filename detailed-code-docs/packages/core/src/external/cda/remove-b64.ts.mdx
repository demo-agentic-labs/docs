## High-level description
This code defines a function `removeBase64PdfEntries` that processes an XML payload, specifically targeting Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents. It removes base64-encoded PDF entries from the notes section of the document, returning the modified XML if any entries were removed, or the original payload if no changes were made.

## Code Structure
The main function `removeBase64PdfEntries` uses the `XMLParser` and `XMLBuilder` from the `fast-xml-parser` library to parse and rebuild the XML. It also utilizes utility functions and constants from other parts of the codebase.

## References
- `@metriport/shared`: Used for the `toArray` function.
- `../../util/mime`: Imports `BINARY_MIME_TYPES` constant.

### `removeBase64PdfEntries`
#### Description
This function processes an XML payload to remove base64-encoded PDF entries from the notes section of a CDA document.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payloadRaw | string | The raw XML payload to process |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The processed XML payload, with base64 PDF entries removed if any were found, or the original payload if no changes were made |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parse the input XML into a JSON object.
2. Iterate through the components of the structured body.
3. For each component with a matching template ID for notes:
   - Filter out entries that are binary MIME types and have base64 representation.
4. Count the number of removed entries.
5. Rebuild the XML from the modified JSON object.
6. Return the rebuilt XML if entries were removed, otherwise return the original payload.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Provides the `toArray` utility function |
| fast-xml-parser | Used for parsing and building XML |

## Constants
| Constant | Value | Description |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| notesTemplateId | "2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.65" | Template ID for identifying the notes section |
| b64Representation | "B64" | Identifier for base64 representation |

## Performance Considerations
The function processes the entire XML document, which could be computationally expensive for large documents. It uses in-memory parsing and manipulation, which might have memory implications for very large payloads.
