## High-level description
This directory contains code related to handling Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) XML structures, specifically focusing on processing and generating CDA documents. It includes functions for creating various CDA examples with different content types and encodings, as well as a utility for removing base64-encoded PDF entries from CDA documents.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves two main purposes:

1. Test Data Generation: It provides a set of functions that generate different examples of CDA XML structures. These functions create CDA documents with various content types (such as plain text, PDF, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, and octet-stream) and different encodings (primarily Base64). These examples are likely used for testing purposes, allowing developers to work with a range of CDA document structures and content types.

2. CDA Document Processing: It includes a function that processes CDA documents to remove base64-encoded PDF entries from the notes section. This functionality could be useful in scenarios where you need to strip out large binary data from CDA documents, potentially to reduce document size or to separate textual and binary content.

The workflow for processing a CDA document to remove base64 PDF entries would typically involve:
1. Parsing the input XML document
2. Identifying the notes section within the document structure
3. Filtering out entries that are PDF files encoded in base64
4. Rebuilding the XML document without these entries
5. Returning the modified document if changes were made, or the original if no changes were necessary

## Key Files

1. `__tests__/index.ts`:
   This file contains a collection of functions that generate different CDA XML examples. Each function creates a specific type of CDA document, such as:
   - Empty `&lt;nonXMLBody&gt;` tag
   - Multiple `&lt;nonXMLBody&gt;` tags
   - Base64 encoded content of various types (text, PDF, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, octet-stream)
   These functions are crucial for testing CDA processing logic with different document structures and content types.

2. `remove-b64.ts`:
   This file defines the `removeBase64PdfEntries` function, which is responsible for processing CDA documents and removing base64-encoded PDF entries from the notes section. It uses XML parsing and rebuilding techniques to modify the document structure.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries:

1. `fast-xml-parser` (version not specified):
   - Used for parsing and rebuilding XML documents
   - Chosen for its performance in handling XML data

2. `@metriport/shared` (version not specified):
   - Provides utility functions like `toArray`
   - Likely an internal library for shared functionality across the project

## Configuration
The code uses some configuration constants:

1. In `remove-b64.ts`:
   - `notesTemplateId`: "2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.65" (Identifies the notes section in CDA documents)
   - `b64Representation`: "B64" (Identifier for base64 representation)

2. The code also references `BINARY_MIME_TYPES` from `../../util/mime`, which likely defines the MIME types considered as binary data.

These configurations help in identifying specific sections within CDA documents and determining which content types should be processed or removed.

In summary, this directory provides essential functionality for working with CDA documents, both for testing purposes and for processing real documents to remove certain types of content. The code demonstrates a good understanding of CDA structure and provides flexible tools for manipulating these documents programmatically.
