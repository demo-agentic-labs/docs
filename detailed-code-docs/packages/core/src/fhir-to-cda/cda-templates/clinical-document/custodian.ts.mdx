## High-level description
This code defines a function `buildCustodian()` that creates and returns a `CdaCustodian` object. The function is part of a larger system that converts FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format.

## Code Structure
The `buildCustodian()` function uses the `buildRepresentedOrganization()` function from the commons module and the `metriportOrganization` constant from the shared module to construct the `CdaCustodian` object.

## References
- `metriportOrganization` from "@metriport/shared"
- `buildRepresentedOrganization` from "../commons"
- `CdaCustodian` type from "../../cda-types/shared-types"

## Symbols

### `buildCustodian()`
#### Description
This function creates and returns a `CdaCustodian` object, which represents the custodian of a clinical document in the CDA format.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| custodian | CdaCustodian | An object representing the custodian of the clinical document |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `custodian` object with an `assignedCustodian` property.
2. The `assignedCustodian` contains a `representedCustodianOrganization` property.
3. The `representedCustodianOrganization` is built using the `buildRepresentedOrganization()` function, passing `metriportOrganization` as an argument.
4. Returns the constructed `custodian` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Provides the `metriportOrganization` constant |
| ../commons | Provides the `buildRepresentedOrganization` function |
| ../../cda-types/shared-types | Provides the `CdaCustodian` type definition |

## Notes
- The `metriportOrganization` constant likely contains information about the Metriport organization, which is used as the custodian of the clinical document.
- This function is part of a larger system for converting FHIR data to CDA format, as evidenced by its location in the file structure and its use of shared types and functions.
- The function doesn't handle any error cases or validate inputs, assuming that the `buildRepresentedOrganization` function and `metriportOrganization` constant are always available and correctly formatted.
