## High-level description
This code defines and exports an instance of `XMLBuilder` from the `fast-xml-parser` library. The `XMLBuilder` is configured with specific options to control the XML output format and attribute handling.

## Symbols

### `xmlBuilder`
#### Description
`xmlBuilder` is an instance of `XMLBuilder` from the `fast-xml-parser` library. It is configured with specific options to control how XML is generated.

#### Inputs
The `XMLBuilder` constructor takes an options object with the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| format | boolean | Controls whether the output XML should be formatted (pretty-printed) |
| attributeNamePrefix | string | Prefix to be added to attribute names in the XML output |
| ignoreAttributes | boolean | Determines whether attributes should be ignored when generating XML |
| suppressBooleanAttributes | boolean | Controls the handling of boolean attributes in the XML output |

#### Outputs
The `xmlBuilder` instance provides methods for converting JavaScript objects to XML strings, though these methods are not explicitly shown in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The `XMLBuilder` is instantiated with the following configuration:
- `format: false`: The output XML will not be formatted or pretty-printed.
- `attributeNamePrefix: "_"`: Attribute names in the XML will be prefixed with an underscore.
- `ignoreAttributes: false`: Attributes will be included in the XML output.
- `suppressBooleanAttributes: false`: Boolean attributes will be explicitly included in the XML output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fast-xml-parser | Provides the `XMLBuilder` class for XML generation |

This `xmlBuilder` instance is likely used elsewhere in the project to convert JavaScript objects representing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) XML format. The specific configuration suggests that the resulting XML needs to be compact (not formatted) and should include all attributes, which is typical for healthcare data exchange scenarios where space efficiency and completeness are important.
