## High-level description
This code defines a function `buildAssessmentAndPlan()` that creates and returns an `AssessmentAndPlanSection` object. The function is part of a larger system that converts FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format, specifically for the assessment and plan section of a clinical document.

## Symbols

### `buildAssessmentAndPlan()`
#### Description
This function constructs and returns an `AssessmentAndPlanSection` object with predefined values. Currently, it's a placeholder implementation that returns a null-flavored section, indicating that the actual mapping is yet to be implemented.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | AssessmentAndPlanSection | An object representing the Assessment and Plan section of a CDA document |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an `AssessmentAndPlanSection` object with the following properties:
   - `_nullFlavor`: Set to "NI" (No Information)
   - `templateId`: Uses `buildTemplateIds()` to create template identifiers
   - `code`: Uses `buildCodeCe()` to create a coded element for the section
   - `title`: Set to "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN"
   - `text`: Set to a placeholder value using `notOnFilePlaceholder`

2. The `templateId` is constructed using:
   - `root`: Set to `oids.assessmentAndPlanSection`
   - `extension`: Set to `extensionValue2014`

3. The `code` is constructed using:
   - `code`: "51847-2"
   - `codeSystem`: `loincCodeSystem`
   - `codeSystemName`: `loincSystemName`
   - `displayName`: "Assessment and Plan"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AssessmentAndPlanSection | Type definition for the return value |
| buildCodeCe | Helper function to build coded elements |
| buildTemplateIds | Helper function to build template identifiers |
| notOnFilePlaceholder | Placeholder value for the text field |
| extensionValue2014, loincCodeSystem, loincSystemName, oids | Constants used in building the section |

## TODOs
- Implement the actual assessment and plan section mapping. The current implementation is a placeholder that returns a null-flavored section.

## References
The `buildAssessmentAndPlan()` function is referenced in the `buildStructuredBody()` function from the related code snippet. It's used as part of constructing the structured body of a clinical document, along with other sections like social history, medications, problems, etc.

This implementation suggests that the assessment and plan section is a required part of the CDA document being generated, but the actual content mapping from FHIR to CDA for this section is not yet implemented.
