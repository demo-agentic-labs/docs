## High-level description
This file contains example Condition objects used for testing purposes in the FHIR to CDA conversion process. It defines four partial Condition objects representing different medical conditions: nicotine dependence, hyperlipidemia, heart attack, and stroke. These examples are used to simulate real-world medical data in test scenarios.

## Symbols

### `conditionNicotine`
#### Description
A partial Condition object representing nicotine dependence.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditionNicotine | Partial&lt;Condition&gt; | A partial Condition object for nicotine dependence |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the condition code using ICD-10 coding system
- Includes a note about smoking cessation advice

### `conditionHyperlipidemia`
#### Description
A partial Condition object representing hyperlipidemia.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditionHyperlipidemia | Partial&lt;Condition&gt; | A partial Condition object for hyperlipidemia |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the condition code using ICD-10-CM coding system

### `conditionHeartAttack`
#### Description
A partial Condition object representing a heart attack (myocardial infarction).

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditionHeartAttack | Partial&lt;Condition&gt; | A partial Condition object for a heart attack |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the condition code using SNOMED CT coding system
- Includes onset age information
- Contains a note about the circumstances of the heart attack

### `conditionStroke`
#### Description
A partial Condition object representing a stroke (embolic stroke).

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditionStroke | Partial&lt;Condition&gt; | A partial Condition object for a stroke |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the condition code using SNOMED CT coding system
- Includes onset age information

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources, specifically the Condition type |

## References
This file is referenced in the related test file `family-history.test.ts`, where the `conditionHeartAttack` and `conditionStroke` examples are used to create test scenarios for family history records.

The examples in this file are crucial for testing the FHIR to CDA conversion process, particularly for handling different types of medical conditions with varying levels of detail and coding systems.
