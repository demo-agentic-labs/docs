## High-level description
This file contains example data for allergy intolerances in FHIR format. It defines two partial `AllergyIntolerance` objects: `allergyMedication` for a penicillin allergy and `allergyFood` for a cashew nut allergy. These examples are likely used for testing or demonstration purposes in the FHIR to CDA conversion process.

## Symbols

### `allergyMedication`
