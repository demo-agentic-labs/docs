## High-level description
This file defines an example of a mental status observation using the FHIR Observation resource structure. It specifically models a PHQ-9 quick depression assessment panel with sample data for three questions from the assessment.

## Symbols

### `observationMentalStatus`
#### Description
This constant represents a partial FHIR Observation resource for a mental status assessment, specifically a PHQ-9 quick depression assessment panel.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This is a constant, not a function, so it doesn't have inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| observationMentalStatus | Partial&lt;Observation&gt; | A partial FHIR Observation resource representing a mental status assessment |

#### Internal Logic
The `observationMentalStatus` object is structured as follows:
1. It sets the status as "final".
2. It categorizes the observation as a "survey".
3. It specifies the code for the PHQ-9 assessment using LOINC coding.
4. It provides an overall value of "Low risk" for the assessment.
5. It includes timestamps for when the assessment was effective and issued.
6. It contains a `component` array with three questions from the PHQ-9 assessment, each including:
   - The question code and text
   - The patient's response (all set to "Not at all" in this example)
   - An interpretation score (all set to 0 in this example)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Imports the Observation type from the FHIR types library |

## Notes
1. This file is likely used for testing purposes, as indicated by its location in a `__tests__` directory.
2. The example data represents a patient with no symptoms of depression, as all responses are "Not at all" with scores of 0.
3. The file uses LOINC codes for standardized medical terminology, which is common in healthcare informatics.
4. The overall risk assessment is "Low risk", which aligns with the individual responses.
5. The timestamps used in the example are specific (July 23, 2012, at 17:16:00.324 -07:00), which might be relevant for certain test cases.
