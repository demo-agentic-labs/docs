## High-level description
This file defines a sample immunization record for a flu vaccine using the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Immunization resource structure. It serves as an example or test data for immunization-related operations in a healthcare application.

## Symbols

### `immunizationFlu`
#### Description
`immunizationFlu` is a constant that represents a partial Immunization resource for a flu vaccine. It contains key information about the immunization event, including the vaccine type, patient reference, encounter reference, and administration date.

#### Inputs
This is a constant, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it is of type `Partial&lt;Immunization&gt;`, which means it contains a subset of the properties of a full Immunization resource.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| immunizationFlu | Partial&lt;Immunization&gt; | A partial Immunization resource representing a flu vaccine administration |

#### Internal Logic
The constant defines the following properties:
1. `status`: Set to "completed", indicating the immunization has been administered.
2. `vaccineCode`: Contains coding information for the specific vaccine used.
3. `patient`: References the patient who received the vaccine.
4. `encounter`: References the encounter during which the vaccine was administered.
5. `occurrenceDateTime`: Specifies the date and time when the vaccine was administered.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources, specifically the Immunization type used in this file |

## Notes
1. This file is likely used for testing or as example data in the larger application.
2. The use of `Partial&lt;Immunization&gt;` allows for the creation of an incomplete Immunization resource, which is useful for testing scenarios where not all fields are required.
3. The vaccine code uses the CVX (Vaccine Administered) coding system, which is a standard for vaccine product identification.
4. The date and time are provided in ISO 8601 format with timezone offset.
5. Patient and Encounter references use FHIR resource identifiers, suggesting this data is part of a larger FHIR-compliant dataset or system.
