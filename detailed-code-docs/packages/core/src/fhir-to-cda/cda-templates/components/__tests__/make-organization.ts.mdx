## High-level description
This file defines a utility function `makeOrganization` that creates a mock Organization resource for FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). It's primarily used for testing purposes, allowing developers to generate realistic Organization data with customizable properties.

## Symbols

### `makeOrganization`
#### Description
The `makeOrganization` function creates a mock Organization resource with default values and allows for customization through the `params` argument. It uses the Faker library to generate random data for certain fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Partial&lt;Organization&gt; | Optional. An object containing partial Organization properties to override default values. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | A mock Organization resource with generated and/or customized properties. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the spread operator to combine default values and custom parameters:
   - If `params.id` is provided, it uses that; otherwise, it generates a random UUID using `faker.string.uuid()`.
   - It includes properties from `makeSubjectReference()` (likely another utility function for generating common reference properties).
   - Sets the `resourceType` to "Organization".
   - Spreads any additional properties from the `params` object, allowing for further customization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random data, specifically UUIDs in this case. |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources, including the Organization type. |

## References
- `makeSubjectReference`: This function is imported and used within `makeOrganization`, but its implementation is not provided in this file. It likely generates common reference properties for FHIR resources.

## Notes
- This function is part of a testing utility, as evidenced by its location in the `__tests__` directory and its use of faker for generating mock data.
- The function allows for flexible creation of Organization resources, which can be useful for various testing scenarios in healthcare applications using the FHIR standard.
- The use of TypeScript ensures type safety when working with FHIR resources.
