## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `buildVitalSigns` function, which is responsible for converting FHIR vital signs observations into a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format. The tests verify the correct mapping and grouping of vital signs observations, including handling of different dates and non-vital sign observations.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses Jest and includes several test cases that check different aspects of the `buildVitalSigns` function. It uses mock data and helper functions to create test scenarios and validate the output.

## Symbols

### `describe.skip("buildVitalSigns", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `buildVitalSigns` function. The `skip` indicates that these tests are currently skipped and not running.

#### Internal Logic
The suite contains multiple test cases that check different scenarios for vital signs conversion.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This function runs before each test case, setting up the initial test environment.

#### Internal Logic
- Generates a random UUID for `observationId`
- Creates a mock observation using `makeObservation`
- Initializes an empty FHIR bundle

### `it("does not pick up non-vital-signs Observations", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `buildVitalSigns` function only processes vital signs observations and ignores others.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a vital sign observation and a non-vital sign observation to the bundle
2. Calls `buildVitalSigns` with the bundle
3. Checks that the result contains the vital sign observation ID but not the non-vital sign observation ID

### `it("correctly maps a vital-signs Observation", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case checks if a single vital signs observation is correctly mapped to the CDA format.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a vital sign observation to the bundle
2. Calls `buildVitalSigns` with the bundle
3. Compares the result with an expected XML template

### `it("correctly maps and groups a handful of vital-signs Observations taken on the same date", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that multiple vital signs observations taken on the same date are correctly grouped and mapped.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds multiple vital sign observations with the same date to the bundle
2. Calls `buildVitalSigns` with the bundle
3. Compares the result with an expected XML template

### `it("correctly maps and groups a handful of vital-signs Observations taken on different dates", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case checks if vital signs observations taken on different dates are correctly grouped and mapped.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds multiple vital sign observations with different dates to the bundle
2. Calls `buildVitalSigns` with the bundle
3. Compares the result with an expected XML template

## Dependencies
- `@faker-js/faker`: Used for generating random data
- `@medplum/fhirtypes`: Provides FHIR type definitions
- `lodash`: Utility library
- `path`: Node.js path module
- Various imported functions and constants from local modules

## Notes
- The tests are currently skipped (`describe.skip`), which means they are not being executed. This might indicate that the tests are under development or temporarily disabled.
- The tests rely on external XML files for expected output comparisons, which are loaded using the `getXmlContentFromFile` function.
- The `removeEmptyFields` function is used to clean up the output before comparison, likely to handle optional fields or null values.
