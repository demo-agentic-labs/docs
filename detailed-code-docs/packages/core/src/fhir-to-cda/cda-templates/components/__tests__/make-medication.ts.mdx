## High-level description
This code defines a function `makeMedication` that creates a mock Medication resource for FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). It's primarily used for testing purposes, allowing developers to generate realistic-looking medication data with customizable properties.

## Symbols

### `makeMedication`
#### Description
This function creates a Medication resource object with default values and allows for customization through the `params` argument.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Partial&lt;Medication&gt; | Optional. Partial Medication object to override default values. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| medication | Medication | A complete Medication resource object. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new object with a spread of properties:
   - Generates a random UUID for the `id` if not provided in `params`.
   - Sets `resourceType` to "Medication".
   - Sets a default `code` object if not provided in `params`. The default code includes:
     - Two coding systems: RxNorm and NDC.
     - A text description of the medication.
2. Spreads the `params` object to override any default values with provided custom values.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random UUIDs for the medication `id`. |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources, including the Medication type. |

## Performance Considerations
The function uses object spreading, which is generally efficient for creating new objects. However, if this function is called very frequently, it might be worth considering object pooling or memoization techniques to optimize performance.

## Notes
- This function is likely part of a test utility suite, used to generate mock data for unit tests or integration tests involving FHIR Medication resources.
- The default medication code represents acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 500 mg tablet, which is a common over-the-counter pain reliever.
- The function allows for flexible creation of Medication resources, as any property of the Medication type can be overridden by passing it in the `params` object.
