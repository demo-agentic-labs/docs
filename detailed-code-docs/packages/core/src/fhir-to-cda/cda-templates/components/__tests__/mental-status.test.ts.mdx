title: "mental-status.test.ts"

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `buildMentalStatus` function, which is responsible for processing mental status observations from a FHIR Bundle and converting them into a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format. The tests ensure that the function correctly identifies mental status observations and generates the expected XML output.

## Code Structure
The test file imports necessary dependencies, sets up test data, and defines two test cases within a skipped describe block. The tests focus on verifying the correct handling of mental status observations and the generation of appropriate XML output.

## Symbols

### `beforeAll` function
#### Description
This function sets up the initial test data by creating a mental status observation with a unique ID.

#### Internal Logic
- Generates a unique ID using `faker.string.uuid()`
- Creates an observation object using `makeObservation` function with the generated ID and predefined mental status data

### `beforeEach` function
#### Description
This function resets the test bundle before each test case.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an empty bundle using `createEmptyBundle()`
- Adds the previously created observation to the bundle

### `describe.skip("buildMentalStatus")` block
#### Description
This describe block contains the test cases for the `buildMentalStatus` function. It is currently skipped, likely for debugging or development purposes.

### Test: "does not pick up non-mental-status Observations"
#### Description
This test verifies that the `buildMentalStatus` function correctly ignores observations that are not related to mental status.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a non-mental-status observation
2. Adds both mental status and non-mental-status observations to the bundle
3. Calls `buildMentalStatus` with the bundle
4. Removes empty fields from the result
5. Converts the result to XML
6. Checks that the XML contains the mental status observation ID and code, but not the non-mental-status observation ID

### Test: "correctly maps a single mental status survey Observation"
#### Description
This test ensures that the `buildMentalStatus` function correctly processes a single mental status observation and generates the expected XML output.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads an expected XML template from a file
2. Applies the observation ID to the template
3. Calls `buildMentalStatus` with the bundle containing a single mental status observation
4. Removes empty fields from the result
5. Converts the result to XML
6. Compares the generated XML with the expected XML content

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Generating fake data for testing |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Providing FHIR type definitions |
| path | Handling file paths |
| xmlBuilder | Building XML from JSON objects |
| lodash | Utility functions, specifically for templating |

## TODOs
The `describe` block is currently skipped (`describe.skip`), which suggests that these tests are not currently being run. This may be intentional for development purposes, but should be reviewed and potentially re-enabled when ready.
