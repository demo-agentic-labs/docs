## High-level description
This file defines a constant `observationSocialHistory` which represents a partial FHIR Observation resource focused on social history. It includes detailed information about a patient's social determinants of health, living situation, and potential housing problems.

## Symbols

### `observationSocialHistory`
#### Description
This constant is a partial FHIR Observation resource that captures social history information for a patient. It includes the overall status, category, code, value, effective date, interpretation, and components related to specific social determinants of health questions.

#### Type
`Partial&lt;Observation&gt;`

#### Internal Logic
The object is structured according to the FHIR Observation resource with the following key elements:
1. Status: Set to "final"
2. Category: Coded as "social-history"
3. Code: Represents "Social determinants of health" (SDOH)
4. Value: Indicates "Low risk"
5. Effective DateTime: Specifies when the observation was made
6. Interpretation: Provides an overall interpretation of "Low risk"
7. Components: Contains two specific questions related to living situation and housing problems

Each component includes:
- A code identifying the question
- A value representing the answer
- An interpretation (where applicable) providing a score

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Imports the `Observation` type from the Medplum FHIR types library |

## Notes
1. This example uses LOINC codes for identifying specific questions and answers related to social determinants of health.
2. The observation is structured to capture both an overall SDOH risk assessment and specific components related to housing and living situation.
3. The use of coding systems (e.g., LOINC, HL7 CodeSystem) ensures standardized representation of concepts, which is crucial for interoperability in healthcare data exchange.
4. This example could be used for testing or as a template for creating similar social history observations in a FHIR-based healthcare application.
