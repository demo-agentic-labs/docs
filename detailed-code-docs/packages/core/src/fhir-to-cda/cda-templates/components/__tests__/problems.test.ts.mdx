## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `buildProblems` function, which is responsible for converting FHIR Condition resources into a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) Problems section. The tests verify the correct mapping of Condition data to the CDA format, including handling of notes, multiple conditions, and XML structure.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into a single `describe` block (currently skipped) containing multiple test cases. It uses Jest as the testing framework and includes setup code in `beforeAll` and `beforeEach` blocks to prepare test data.

## Symbols

### `beforeAll`
#### Description
This function sets up the initial test data, creating a condition with a unique ID and note.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a unique ID using `faker.string.uuid()`.
2. Creates a condition using `makeCondition` with the generated ID and a note from `conditionNicotine`.

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
This function resets the test bundle before each test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an empty bundle using `createEmptyBundle()`.
2. Adds the previously created condition to the bundle.

### `describe.skip("buildProblems", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `buildProblems` function. It's currently skipped, likely due to ongoing development or issues.

#### Internal Logic
Contains multiple test cases that check different aspects of the `buildProblems` function:
1. Verifies that the text note is correctly included in the Problems table.
2. Checks the mapping of a single Condition without a note.
3. Tests the mapping of two Conditions with notes.

Each test case follows this general structure:
1. Set up the test data (modify the bundle as needed).
2. Call `buildProblems` with the prepared bundle.
3. Clean the result using `removeEmptyFields`.
4. Convert the result to XML using `xmlBuilder.build`.
5. Compare the generated XML with expected XML content (either directly or from a file).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Generating fake data for tests |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| path | Handling file paths |
| xmlBuilder | Converting JSON objects to XML |

## TODOs
1. Remove console.log statements after fixing tsconfig to ignore "unused" variables.
2. Address the skipped test suite by resolving any underlying issues.

Note: The test suite is currently skipped, which might indicate ongoing development or unresolved issues with the `buildProblems` function or its dependencies.
