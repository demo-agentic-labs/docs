## High-level description
This code defines a function `splitBundleByCompositions` that takes a FHIR Bundle as input and splits it into multiple bundles based on the compositions found within. It extracts relevant resources for each composition and creates separate bundles for each.

## Code Structure
The main function `splitBundleByCompositions` uses helper functions from external modules to find and validate resources within the input bundle. It then creates new bundles for each composition, including related resources.

## References
- `findResourceInBundle` from "../external/fhir/shared"
- `isComposition` from "../external/fhir/shared"
- `capture` from "../util"
- `BadRequestError` from "../util/error/bad-request"

### `splitBundleByCompositions`
#### Description
This function takes a FHIR Bundle and splits it into multiple bundles based on the compositions found within it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fhirBundle | Bundle | The incoming FHIR bundle to be split |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bundles | Bundle[] | An array of FHIR bundles, each corresponding to a composition |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract all compositions from the input bundle
2. Throw an error if no compositions are found
3. For each composition:
   - Find the referenced patient and organization resources
   - Create a new bundle with the composition, patient, and organization
   - Add referenced resources from each section of the composition to the new bundle
4. Return the array of created bundles

## Error Handling
- Throws a `BadRequestError` if no compositions are found in the input bundle
- Throws a `BadRequestError` if an invalid Patient or Organization reference is found in a composition

## Logging
The code uses a `capture.error` function to log errors when an invalid Patient reference is encountered.

This code is part of a larger system for processing FHIR data and generating CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents. It plays a crucial role in preparing FHIR data for conversion to CDA format by organizing related resources around each composition in the input bundle.
