## High-level description
This file defines various section types for a Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) document. It exports type definitions for different sections such as Results, Medication, Immunizations, Mental Status, Social History, Problems, Allergies, Encounters, Vital Signs, Family History, Notes, Procedures, and Assessment and Plan.

## Code Structure
The file defines a generic `CdaSection&lt;T&gt;` type and then uses it to create specific section types. Each section type is a specialized version of `CdaSection` with a specific entry type.

### `CdaSection&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
A generic type representing a section in a CDA document.

#### Internal Logic
- Can be either an object with specific properties or `undefined`.
- When defined, it includes properties like `templateId`, `code`, `title`, `text`, and optionally `entry`.
- The `entry` property is of type `T` or an array of `T`.

### Section Types
The file exports several section types, each using the `CdaSection` generic type with a specific entry type:

- `ResultsSection`: Uses `ObservationOrganizer` as the entry type.
- `MedicationSection`: Uses `SubstanceAdministationEntry` as the entry type.
- `ImmunizationsSection`: Uses `SubstanceAdministationEntry` as the entry type.
- `MentalStatusSection`: Uses `ObservationEntry` as the entry type.
- `SocialHistorySection`: Uses `ObservationEntry` as the entry type.
- `ProblemsSection`: Uses `ConcernActEntry` as the entry type.
- `AllergiesSection`: Uses `ConcernActEntry` as the entry type.
- `EncountersSection`: Uses `EncounterEntry` as the entry type.
- `VitalSignsSection`: Uses `ObservationOrganizer` as the entry type.
- `FamilyHistorySection`: Uses `ObservationOrganizer` as the entry type.
- `NotesSection`: Uses `ConcernActEntry` as the entry type.
- `ProceduresSection`: Uses `ProcedureActivityEntry` as the entry type.
- `AssessmentAndPlanSection`: Uses `ObservationOrganizer` as the entry type.

## Dependencies
The file imports various types from other modules:
- `CdaTable` from "../cda-templates/table"
- Several types from "./shared-types"

## Notes
This file serves as a central definition for the structure of different sections in a CDA document. It provides a consistent way to represent various types of medical information within the CDA format.
