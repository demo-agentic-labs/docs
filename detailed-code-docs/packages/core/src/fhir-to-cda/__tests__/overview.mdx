## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for various utility functions and components related to FHIR to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) conversion. The tests cover functionality such as splitting FHIR bundles, formatting dates, and removing empty fields from objects.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory ensures the correct functioning of several key components in the FHIR to CDA conversion process:

1. It verifies the `splitBundleByCompositions` function, which is responsible for dividing a FHIR Bundle into separate bundles based on Composition resources. This is crucial for handling complex medical documents that may contain multiple compositions.

2. It tests date formatting functions that convert various date and time formats to specific CDA timestamp formats and human-readable formats. This is important for ensuring that dates are correctly represented in the final CDA document.

3. It checks the `removeEmptyFields` function, which cleans up objects by removing undefined or empty string values. This helps in producing cleaner and more compact CDA documents.

These tests help maintain the reliability and correctness of the FHIR to CDA conversion process, which is likely a critical part of the larger healthcare data interoperability system.

## Key Files

1. `composition-splitter.test.ts`:
   This file tests the `splitBundleByCompositions` function. It verifies that the function correctly handles various scenarios, including:
   - Throwing errors for empty input bundles
   - Throwing errors when no Composition resources are present
   - Throwing errors when referenced resources are missing
   - Successfully splitting a valid bundle with all required references

2. `format-date-to-cda-timestamp.test.ts`:
   This file tests the `formatDateToCdaTimestamp` function. It ensures that the function correctly converts various date and time formats to the specific CDA timestamp format. The tests cover:
   - Handling undefined inputs
   - Formatting date-time strings with and without milliseconds
   - Handling date-only strings
   - Dealing with different timezone offsets
   - Handling invalid date strings

3. `format-date-to-human-readable.test.ts`:
   This file tests the `formatDateToHumanReadableFormat` function. It verifies that the function correctly converts date and time strings to a human-readable format. The tests cover similar scenarios to the CDA timestamp tests, but with a focus on producing easily readable date strings.

4. `remove-empty-fields.test.ts`:
   This file tests the `removeEmptyFields` function. It ensures that the function correctly removes undefined or empty string values from objects, including nested objects and arrays. The tests cover:
   - Removing empty fields from simple objects
   - Recursively removing empty fields in nested structures
   - Handling objects without any empty fields
   - Dealing with non-object inputs
   - Managing complex nested structures with arrays and objects

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following main dependencies:

1. @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources, used in the composition splitter tests.
2. dayjs: A date manipulation library used for handling and formatting dates in the date formatting tests.

Jest is used as the testing framework across all test files, as evidenced by the use of `describe`, `it`, and `expect` functions.

## Configuration
No specific configuration files are present in this directory. However, the tests rely on the Jest configuration that is likely defined at a higher level in the project structure.

The tests make use of various input data and expected output data to verify the functionality of the tested functions. These test cases serve as a form of configuration, defining the expected behavior of the functions under different scenarios.

In summary, this test suite plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the FHIR to CDA conversion process, covering key aspects such as bundle splitting, date formatting, and object cleaning. The comprehensive nature of these tests helps maintain the quality of the conversion process, which is essential for accurate and interoperable healthcare data exchange.
