## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `splitBundleByCompositions` function, which is responsible for splitting a FHIR Bundle based on its Composition resources. The tests cover various scenarios, including error cases and successful splitting of a valid bundle.

## Symbols

### `describe("splitBundleByCompositions", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `splitBundleByCompositions` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify the function's behavior under different conditions.

### `it("throws BadRequestError for an empty input bundle", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function throws a `BadRequestError` when given an empty input bundle.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create an empty FHIR Bundle.
2. Act & Assert: Expect the function to throw a `BadRequestError` when called with the empty bundle.

### `it("throws BadRequestError when no Composition resources are present", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case checks if the function throws a `BadRequestError` when the input bundle contains no Composition resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a bundle with a Patient resource but no Composition resource.
2. Act & Assert: Expect the function to throw a `BadRequestError` when called with this bundle.

### `it("throws BadRequestError if the patient resource is missing", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case ensures that the function throws a `BadRequestError` when the patient resource referenced in the Composition is missing from the bundle.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a bundle with a Composition resource referencing a Patient, but without the actual Patient resource.
2. Act & Assert: Expect the function to throw a `BadRequestError` when called with this bundle.

### `it("successfully splits bundle with valid Composition and all required references", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the function correctly splits a valid bundle containing a Composition resource and all its required references.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a valid bundle with a Composition resource, a referenced Patient resource, and a referenced Organization resource.
2. Act: Call the `splitBundleByCompositions` function with the valid bundle.
3. Assert: 
   - Expect the result to be an array with one element (one split bundle).
   - Expect the split bundle to contain 3 entries (Composition, Patient, and Organization).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides TypeScript types for FHIR resources |
| ../../util/error/bad-request | Imports the BadRequestError class for error handling |
| ../composition-splitter | Imports the splitBundleByCompositions function being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests specifically check for `BadRequestError` being thrown in various error scenarios, such as empty input, missing Composition resources, and missing referenced resources.

## References
The code references the following external symbols:
- `Bundle` from "@medplum/fhirtypes"
- `BadRequestError` from "../../util/error/bad-request"
- `splitBundleByCompositions` from "../composition-splitter"

These references are crucial for understanding the test cases and the function being tested.
