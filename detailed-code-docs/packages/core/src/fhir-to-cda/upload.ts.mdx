Here's a detailed documentation of the `upload.ts` file:

## High-level description
This file contains functions for uploading CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) documents and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) bundles to an S3 bucket. It provides functionality to handle the upload process, including error handling and logging.

## Code Structure
The file exports two main functions: `uploadCdaDocuments` and `uploadFhirBundleToS3`. These functions use the `S3Utils` class from the AWS S3 utility module to perform the actual upload operations.

## Symbols

### `uploadCdaDocuments`
#### Description
This function uploads CDA documents to an S3 bucket and creates corresponding metadata files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | Customer ID |
| patientId | string | Patient ID |
| cdaBundles | string[] | Array of CDA document bundles to upload |
| organization | Organization | Organization information |
| docId | string | Document ID |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the `cdaBundles` array.
2. For each bundle, calls `cdaDocumentUploaderHandler` to upload the document and create metadata.
3. Logs the success or failure of the upload process.

#### Side Effects
- Uploads files to S3
- Creates metadata files in S3
- Logs information and errors

### `uploadFhirBundleToS3`
#### Description
This function uploads a FHIR bundle to an S3 bucket.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fhirBundle | unknown | FHIR bundle to upload |
| destinationKey | string | S3 key for the uploaded file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an instance of `S3Utils`.
2. Uploads the FHIR bundle to S3 using the provided destination key.
3. Logs the success of the upload.

#### Side Effects
- Uploads file to S3
- Logs information and errors

## Dependencies
- `@medplum/fhirtypes`: For type definitions
- `@metriport/shared`: For error handling utilities
- `../external/aws/s3`: For S3 operations
- `../shareback/cda-uploader`: For CDA document uploading
- `../util/config`: For configuration settings
- `../util/error/metriport-error`: For custom error handling
- `../util/log`: For logging
- `../util/mime`: For MIME type constants
- `../util/notifications`: For error capturing and reporting

## Error Handling
Both functions use try-catch blocks to handle errors. In case of an error, they log the error message and additional context, and then throw a `MetriportError` with relevant details.

## Logging
The file uses the `out` function from the logging utility to create scoped logging functions. These are used to log information about the upload process, including success messages and error details.

## Configuration
The file uses the `Config` class to retrieve configuration settings such as the S3 bucket name and AWS region.

## Performance Considerations
The `uploadCdaDocuments` function uses `Promise.all` to upload multiple CDA documents concurrently, which can improve performance when dealing with multiple documents.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `upload.ts` file, including its main functions, their inputs and outputs, internal logic, side effects, and other important aspects of the code.
