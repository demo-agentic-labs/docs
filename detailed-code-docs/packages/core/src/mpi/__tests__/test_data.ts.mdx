## High-level description
This file defines test data for the Master Patient Index (MPI) functionality. It exports a constant object `testPatientMPI` containing sample patient data for different scenarios: search, inclusions, and exclusions. The data is structured to represent various patient information fields and is used for testing MPI-related operations.

## Symbols

### `testPatientMPI`
#### Description
A constant object containing sample patient data for MPI testing. It includes three arrays: `sampleSearch`, `sampleInclusions`, and `sampleExclusions`, each containing `PatientMPI` objects with different data configurations.

#### Inputs
This is a constant, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| testPatientMPI | Object | An object containing three arrays of `PatientMPI` objects |

#### Internal Logic
The `testPatientMPI` object is structured as follows:
1. `sampleSearch`: An array of three `PatientMPI` objects with identical basic information but varying contact details.
2. `sampleInclusions`: An array with one `PatientMPI` object, similar to those in `sampleSearch` but without contact information.
3. `sampleExclusions`: An array of three `PatientMPI` objects with different address and contact information compared to the inclusion and search samples.

Each `PatientMPI` object contains fields such as `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `dob`, `genderAtBirth`, `address`, `contact`, and `personalIdentifiers`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Imports the `USState` enum for state representation |
| ../shared | Imports the `PatientMPI` type definition |

## References
- The `PatientMPI` type is imported from the `shared.ts` file in the same directory.
- The `USState` enum is used from the `@metriport/shared` package, specifically for the `state` field in addresses and personal identifiers.

## Notes
1. The test data is designed to cover various scenarios:
   - The `sampleSearch` array includes patients with different combinations of contact information (both phone and email, only phone, only email).
   - The `sampleInclusions` array has a patient with all fields except contact information.
   - The `sampleExclusions` array contains patients with different zip codes and contact information compared to the other samples.

2. All sample patients have the same basic information (name, DOB, gender) but differ in their address, contact, and personal identifier details.

3. The `USState.NY` is consistently used for the state field in addresses and personal identifiers, which might be intentional for testing purposes.

4. The structure of the `PatientMPI` objects aligns with the type definition in the `shared.ts` file, including nested objects for address, contact, and personal identifiers.

This test data file is crucial for unit testing and integration testing of MPI-related functionality, providing a consistent set of sample data to validate search, inclusion, and exclusion logic in the MPI system.
