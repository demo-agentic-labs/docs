title: "normalize-address.ts"

## High-level description
This code defines a function `normalizeAddress` that takes an `Address` object as input and returns a normalized version of the address. The normalization process includes trimming whitespace, converting text to lowercase, standardizing abbreviations, and formatting specific fields like postal code and country.

### `normalizeAddress`
#### Description
This function normalizes an address by standardizing its components. It processes each part of the address (line, city, state, postalCode, and country) to create a consistent format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| { line, city, state, postalCode, country } | Address | An object containing address components |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| normalizedAddress | Address | An object containing the normalized address components |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Line**: 
   - Filters out empty strings
   - Trims whitespace
   - Converts to lowercase
   - Replaces common street type words with abbreviations
   - Removes hyphens
2. **City**: 
   - Trims whitespace
   - Converts to lowercase
   - Removes hyphens
3. **State**: 
   - Trims whitespace
   - Converts to lowercase
   - Takes only the first two characters
4. **Postal Code**: 
   - Removes non-numeric characters
   - Trims whitespace
   - Takes only the first five characters
5. **Country**: 
   - Trims whitespace
   - Converts to lowercase
   - Replaces "us" and "united" with "usa"
   - Takes only the first three characters
   - Defaults to "usa" if not provided

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/shared | Provides the `stripNonNumericChars` function used for postal code normalization |
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides the `Address` type definition |

## Performance Considerations
The function uses multiple string operations and regular expressions, which could impact performance for large datasets. However, for individual address normalization, the performance impact should be negligible.

## Error Handling
The function uses optional chaining (`?.`) to handle potentially undefined input fields, defaulting to empty strings or arrays when necessary. This prevents errors when processing incomplete address data.
