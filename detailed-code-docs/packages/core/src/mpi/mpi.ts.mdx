## High-level description
This code defines an interface `MPI` (Master Patient Index) in TypeScript. The interface declares a single method for finding a matching patient based on provided patient data. It's designed to be implemented by classes that handle patient matching functionality.

## Symbols

### `MPI`
#### Description
`MPI` is an interface that defines the contract for implementing a Master Patient Index functionality. It declares a single method for finding a matching patient.

#### Inputs
This interface doesn't have inputs itself, but it defines a method with inputs.

#### Outputs
This interface doesn't have outputs itself, but it defines a method with an output.

### `findMatchingPatient`
#### Description
This is a method declared in the `MPI` interface. It's designed to find a matching patient based on the provided patient data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patient | PatientData | The patient data used to find a match |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;PatientMPI \| undefined&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves to a matching PatientMPI object or undefined if no match is found |

- `PatientData`: Imported from "../domain/patient"
- `PatientMPI`: Imported from "./shared"

## Dependencies
The code relies on two external types:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PatientData | Represents the data structure for patient information |
| PatientMPI | Represents the data structure for a patient in the Master Patient Index |

## Notes
1. This interface is likely to be implemented by concrete classes that provide specific matching algorithms or integrate with different patient databases.
2. The `findMatchingPatient` method is asynchronous, returning a Promise, which allows for potential database queries or API calls in the implementation.
3. The method may return `undefined` if no matching patient is found, which should be handled appropriately in the implementing classes and calling code.
4. The actual matching logic is not defined in this interface, allowing for flexibility in implementation details.
