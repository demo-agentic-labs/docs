## High-level description
This code defines the `Contact` type, which represents contact information for a patient. It allows for partial records of email and phone contact details.

## Code Structure
The `Contact` type is defined using TypeScript's utility types. It's based on a partial record where the keys are `ContactTypes` and the values are either string or undefined.

## Symbols

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses TypeScript's built-in utility types.

## Usage
The `Contact` type can be used to type-check objects representing patient contact information. It allows for flexible representation of contact details, where either email, phone, both, or neither may be present.

Example usage:
```typescript
const validContact: Contact = { email: "example@email.com" };
const anotherValidContact: Contact = { phone: "1234567890" };
const alsoValidContact: Contact = { email: "example@email.com", phone: "1234567890" };
const emptyContact: Contact = {};
```

This type is likely used in other parts of the codebase where patient information is handled, such as in API responses or database models.
