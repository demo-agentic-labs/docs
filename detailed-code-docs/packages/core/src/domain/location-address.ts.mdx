## High-level description
This code defines types and functions related to location addresses in a TypeScript project. It provides utility functions for handling address data, including the ability to separate coordinates from an address and define strict address types.

## Symbols

### `AddressStrict`
#### Description
A type that represents a strict version of an address, making all fields required except for `addressLine2` and `coordinates`.

#### Internal Logic
It uses TypeScript's utility types `Pick`, `Required`, and `Omit` to create a new type based on the `Address` type.

### `AddressWithCoordinates`
#### Description
A type that extends `AddressStrict` and requires the `coordinates` field.

### `removeCoordinates`
#### Description
A function that separates the coordinates from an `AddressWithCoordinates` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| address | AddressWithCoordinates | An address object with coordinates |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | \{ address: AddressStrict; coordinates: Coordinates \} | An object containing the address without coordinates and the separated coordinates |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses object destructuring to separate the `coordinates` from the rest of the address fields. It then returns an object with the address (without coordinates) and the coordinates separately.

## TODOs
- Add "coordinates" to AddressStrict as optional

## Dependencies
This file depends on the `Address` and `Coordinates` types, which are likely defined in the "./address" module.

## Notes
The code uses TypeScript's advanced type features to create precise types for addresses. The `removeCoordinates` function demonstrates a common pattern for separating specific fields from an object while maintaining type safety.
