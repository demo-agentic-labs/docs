## High-level description
This directory contains code for implementing document querying functionality in a healthcare-related application. It defines an abstract base class for triggering and querying document references, as well as a concrete implementation that uses remote API calls to perform these operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the application to request and retrieve medical documents for patients. Here's a simplified explanation of the process:

1. The application initiates a document query for a specific patient.
2. The system sends a request to a remote server to start searching for the patient's documents.
3. The application then periodically checks the status of this search.
4. If documents are found, or after a certain time has passed, the search concludes.
5. The application receives information about how many documents were found and whether the search is complete.

This process can be repeated multiple times if needed, and it includes features to avoid overloading the system, such as adding random delays between requests and limiting the total search time.

## Key Files

### trigger-and-query.ts
This file defines the abstract base class `TriggerAndQueryDocRefs` which outlines the structure for the document querying process. It includes:
- Configuration options for controlling the query process (e.g., delays, maximum duration, retry attempts).
- An abstract method `triggerDocQuery` for starting a document search.
- An abstract method `getDocQueryStatus` for checking the status of a search.
- A concrete method `queryDocsForPatient` that orchestrates the entire querying process, including retries and status checks.

### trigger-and-query-remote.ts
This file provides a concrete implementation of `TriggerAndQueryDocRefs` called `TriggerAndQueryDocRefsRemote`. It implements the abstract methods by making HTTP requests to a remote API:
- `triggerDocQuery` sends a POST request to start a document search.
- `getDocQueryStatus` sends a GET request to check the status of a search.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries:
- `@metriport/api-sdk`: Provides types related to document queries.
- `axios` (version not specified): Used for making HTTP requests in the remote implementation.

## Configuration
The document querying process can be configured using the `DetailedConfig` type, which includes the following options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| patientChunkDelayJitterMs | number | 1000 | Random delay added between processing patients |
| queryPollDurationMs | number | 10000 | Time between status checks for a query |
| maxQueryDurationMs | number | 71000 | Maximum total duration for a query |
| maxDocQueryAttempts | number | 1 | Maximum number of query attempts |
| minDocsToConsiderCompleted | number | 1 | Minimum number of documents to mark a query as complete |

These configuration options allow fine-tuning of the querying process to balance between responsiveness and system load.

The remote implementation also requires an `apiUrl` to be provided, which serves as the base URL for the API endpoints used in the document querying process.

## Error Handling
Error handling in this code is primarily delegated to the caller. The remote implementation relies on Axios's default error handling, which means that network errors or non-2xx HTTP responses will result in thrown exceptions. These exceptions should be caught and handled by the code that uses this document querying functionality.

In summary, this directory provides a flexible and configurable system for querying patient documents, with the ability to implement different backends (such as the provided remote API implementation) while maintaining a consistent interface for the rest of the application to use.
