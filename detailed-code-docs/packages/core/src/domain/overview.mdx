## High-level description
This directory contains code related to domain entities and business logic for a healthcare data management system. It includes definitions for patients, organizations, document handling, geographic locations, and various utility functions for data processing and conversion.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides the core domain models and business logic for managing healthcare-related data. Key functionalities include:

1. Patient management: Defining patient demographics, identifiers, and data structures.
2. Organization handling: Representing healthcare providers and IT vendors.
3. Document processing: Managing medical records, summaries, and file naming conventions.
4. Geographic data: Handling US state information and address structures.
5. Data conversion: Utilities for converting between different data formats (e.g., FHIR to CDA).
6. Authentication: Implementing code challenges and cookie management for secure access.
7. Query management: Tracking the status and progress of data queries.
8. Webhook handling: Configuring and managing webhook functionality.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive framework for handling healthcare data, ensuring consistency, security, and interoperability across different healthcare information exchanges and data sources.

## Key Files

1. patient.ts: Defines the core Patient model and related utilities.
2. organization.ts: Represents healthcare organizations and their properties.
3. document-query.ts: Manages document querying and retrieval processes.
4. filename.ts: Provides utilities for standardized file naming in the system.
5. conversion/: Contains modules for data format conversions (e.g., FHIR to CDA).
6. auth/: Implements authentication mechanisms including code challenges and cookie management.
7. geographic-locations.ts: Handles US state information and address structures.
8. query-status.ts: Defines types and constants for tracking query status and progress.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. @medplum/fhirtypes: Used for FHIR-related type definitions.
2. @metriport/api-sdk: Provides API-related types and utilities.
3. @metriport/shared: Contains shared types and constants used across the application.
4. aws-sdk: Used for interactions with AWS services, particularly Secrets Manager.
5. dayjs: Employed for date and time manipulation.
6. lodash: Utilized for various utility functions.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, several files contain constants and types that act as configuration:

1. oid.ts: Defines OID prefixes and mappings for various identifiers.
2. webhook/index.ts: Contains a constant for disabling webhooks.
3. auth/: Includes configuration options for code challenges and cookie management.

These configuration values allow for flexibility in adapting the system to different environments and requirements.

In summary, this directory forms the core domain layer of the healthcare data management system, providing essential data structures, business logic, and utilities for handling patient information, medical documents, and interactions with various healthcare information exchanges. The modular design allows for easy extension and maintenance of the system as new requirements emerge.
