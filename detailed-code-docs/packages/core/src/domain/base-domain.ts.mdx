title: "base-domain.ts"

## High-level description
This code defines a set of interfaces that serve as the foundation for domain entities in the application. It provides a structure for creating, identifying, and tracking the lifecycle of domain objects, including support for soft deletion.

## Code Structure
The code defines four main interfaces:
1. `BaseDomainCreate`: Defines the basic identifier for domain objects.
2. `BaseDomainNoId`: Defines creation and update timestamps.
3. `BaseDomain`: Combines `BaseDomainCreate` and `BaseDomainNoId`, adding an eTag for versioning.
4. `BaseDomainSoftDelete`: Extends `BaseDomain` with an optional deletion timestamp.

These interfaces are designed to be extended by specific domain entities throughout the application.

## Symbols

### `BaseDomainCreate`
#### Description
Defines the basic identifier for domain objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the domain object |

### `BaseDomainNoId`
#### Description
Defines creation and update timestamps for domain objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| createdAt | Date | Timestamp of when the object was created |
| updatedAt | Date | Timestamp of when the object was last updated |

### `BaseDomain`
#### Description
Combines `BaseDomainCreate` and `BaseDomainNoId`, adding an eTag for versioning.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the domain object |
| createdAt | Date | Timestamp of when the object was created |
| updatedAt | Date | Timestamp of when the object was last updated |
| eTag | string | Entity tag for versioning and concurrency control |

### `BaseDomainSoftDelete`
#### Description
Extends `BaseDomain` with an optional deletion timestamp for soft delete functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deletedAt | Date \| undefined | Timestamp of when the object was soft deleted, if applicable |

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in types.

## Notes
- The `BaseDomain` interface is the most comprehensive, incorporating all fields from `BaseDomainCreate` and `BaseDomainNoId`.
- The `BaseDomainSoftDelete` interface adds support for soft deletion, which allows for logical deletion of records without physically removing them from the database.
- These interfaces are likely used as building blocks for more specific domain entities throughout the application, providing a consistent structure for basic properties and metadata.
