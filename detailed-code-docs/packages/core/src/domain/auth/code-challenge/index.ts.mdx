## High-level description
This code defines an interface `CodeChallenge` with a single method `getCode()`. The interface is likely used for implementing different strategies to obtain a code, possibly for authentication or verification purposes in the context of the Metriport system.

## Symbols

### `CodeChallenge`
#### Description
`CodeChallenge` is an interface that defines a contract for classes that provide a method to retrieve a code.

#### Methods

##### `getCode()`
###### Description
This method is expected to return a Promise that resolves to a string. The string likely represents a code that can be used for authentication or verification purposes.

###### Inputs
This method doesn't take any parameters.

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | Promise&lt;string&gt; | A Promise that resolves to a string representing the code |

## References
The `CodeChallenge` interface is used in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/core/src/external/commonwell/management/session.ts`, it's used as part of the `SessionManagementConfig` to obtain a code for login challenges.

2. In `packages/core/src/domain/auth/code-challenge/code-challenge-on-secrets.ts`, a class `CodeChallengeFromSecretManager` is implemented that follows this interface.

3. In `packages/utils/src/commonwell/enhance-coverage.ts`, both local and AWS Secrets Manager-based implementations of `CodeChallenge` are used depending on the configuration.

These references suggest that the `CodeChallenge` interface is part of an authentication or security mechanism, possibly related to CommonWell Health Alliance integration in the Metriport system.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a TypeScript interface definition that relies only on the built-in `Promise` type.
