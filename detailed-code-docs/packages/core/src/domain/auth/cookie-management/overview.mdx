## High-level description
This directory contains code for managing cookies in a web application, specifically tailored for authentication purposes. It provides an abstract `CookieManager` class and two concrete implementations: `CookieManagerInMemory` for in-memory storage and `CookieManagerOnSecrets` for storing cookies using AWS Secrets Manager.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a flexible system for handling cookies, which are small pieces of data stored by websites on a user's browser. In this context, cookies are primarily used for authentication purposes. The system allows for:

1. Storing and retrieving cookies either in memory or securely in AWS Secrets Manager.
2. Converting cookies between object and string representations.
3. Updating stored cookies.

This functionality is crucial for maintaining user sessions and managing authentication across different parts of the application, especially when interacting with external services like CommonWell Health Alliance.

## Key Files

1. `cookie-manager.ts`:
   - Defines the `Cookie` type and the abstract `CookieManager` class.
   - Provides utility functions for converting cookies between object and string formats.
   - Sets the interface for cookie management operations.

2. `cookie-manager-in-memory.ts`:
   - Implements `CookieManagerInMemory`, a concrete class extending `CookieManager`.
   - Provides in-memory storage for cookies, useful for local development and testing.

3. `cookie-manager-on-secrets.ts`:
   - Implements `CookieManagerOnSecrets`, another concrete class extending `CookieManager`.
   - Uses AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage of cookies, suitable for production environments.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency for this module is the AWS SDK, specifically used in `cookie-manager-on-secrets.ts` for interacting with AWS Secrets Manager. The version of the AWS SDK is not specified in the provided code snippets.

```typescript
import AWS from "aws-sdk";
```

This dependency is chosen to provide secure, cloud-based storage for cookies in production environments.

## Configuration
The `CookieManagerOnSecrets` class requires configuration for AWS Secrets Manager:

```typescript
constructor(private readonly secretArn: string, region: string) {
  super();
  this.secretsManager = new AWS.SecretsManager({ region });
}
```

- `secretArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager.
- `region`: The AWS region where the secret is stored.

These configuration parameters are crucial for the proper functioning of the AWS Secrets Manager-based cookie storage.

## Code Examples

1. Creating a `CookieManagerInMemory` instance:

```typescript
const cookieManager = new CookieManagerInMemory();
```

2. Retrieving cookies from in-memory storage:

```typescript
const cookies = await cookieManager.getCookies();
```

3. Updating cookies in AWS Secrets Manager:

```typescript
const secretArn = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-id:secret:secret-name";
const region = "us-west-2";
const cookieManager = new CookieManagerOnSecrets(secretArn, region);

const newCookies: Cookie[] = [
  { name: "session_id", value: "abc123" },
  { name: "user_id", value: "user456" }
];

await cookieManager.updateCookies(newCookies);
```

4. Converting cookies to a string:

```typescript
const cookies: Cookie[] = [
  { name: "session_id", value: "abc123" },
  { name: "user_id", value: "user456" }
];

const cookieString = cookiesToString(cookies);
console.log(cookieString); // Output: "session_id=abc123; user_id=user456"
```

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the cookie management system, allowing for easy switching between in-memory and AWS Secrets Manager-based storage, as well as convenient conversion between object and string representations of cookies.

The cookie management system is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy implementation of additional storage mechanisms if needed in the future. This modular approach ensures that the application can adapt to different environments and security requirements while maintaining a consistent interface for cookie management operations.
