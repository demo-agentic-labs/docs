## High-level description
This code defines a `CookieManagerOnSecrets` class that extends `CookieManager` to manage cookies using AWS Secrets Manager. It provides functionality to retrieve and update cookies stored as secrets in AWS.

## Code Structure
The `CookieManagerOnSecrets` class extends the `CookieManager` base class and implements methods to interact with AWS Secrets Manager for cookie management.

## Symbols

### `CookieManagerOnSecrets`
#### Description
A class that manages cookies using AWS Secrets Manager. It extends the `CookieManager` base class and provides methods to retrieve and update cookies stored as secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretArn | string | The ARN of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager |
| region | string | The AWS region where the secret is stored |

#### Internal Logic
- The constructor initializes an AWS.SecretsManager instance with the provided region.
- `getCookies()` retrieves the secret value from AWS Secrets Manager, parses it as JSON, and returns an array of Cookie objects.
- `updateCookies()` takes an array of Cookie objects, stringifies it, and updates the secret in AWS Secrets Manager.

### `getCookies()`
#### Description
Retrieves cookies from AWS Secrets Manager.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cookies | Cookie[] | An array of Cookie objects retrieved from the secret |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the secret value using the secretArn.
2. Checks if the secret string is not empty.
3. Parses the secret string as JSON and returns it as an array of Cookie objects.

### `updateCookies()`
#### Description
Stores cookies in AWS Secrets Manager.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cookies | Cookie[] | An array of Cookie objects to be stored |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cookies | Cookie[] | The same array of Cookie objects that was input |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the input cookies array is not null.
2. Stringifies the cookies array.
3. Updates the secret in AWS Secrets Manager with the stringified cookies.

## Error Handling
Both `getCookies()` and `updateCookies()` methods use try-catch blocks to handle errors. If an error occurs, they throw a `MetriportError` with an appropriate error message and the original error as the cause.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| aws-sdk | To interact with AWS Secrets Manager |
| @metriport/core/util/error/metriport-error | For custom error handling |

This class is used in various parts of the application to manage cookies for CommonWell Health Alliance authentication and session management, particularly in scenarios where secure storage of cookies is required, such as in cloud environments or Lambda functions.
