## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `makeOrgNumber` that generates a random integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000 using the Faker library. It's likely used for creating mock organization numbers in testing scenarios.

## Symbols

### `makeOrgNumber`
#### Description
This function generates a random integer that can be used as an organization number. It utilizes the Faker library to create a random number within a specified range.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | number | A random integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000 |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses `faker.number.int()` method with a configuration object specifying the minimum (0) and maximum (1,000,000,000) values for the generated number.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @faker-js/faker | Used to generate random data, specifically the random integer in this case |

## Performance Considerations
The function is lightweight and should perform quickly. However, if used extensively in tests, it may impact test execution time due to the randomness generation.

## Notes
1. This function is likely used in test scenarios to generate mock organization numbers.
2. The maximum value (1,000,000,000) suggests that organization numbers are expected to be up to 10 digits long.
3. The function is exported, indicating it may be used in other parts of the codebase, possibly in various test files.
