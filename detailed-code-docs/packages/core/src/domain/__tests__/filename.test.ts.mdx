## High-level description
This test file contains unit tests for the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function from the `filename.ts` module. The tests verify the function's ability to generate Hive partition file paths with various configurations, including different date granularities and optional parameters.

## References
The test file references the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function from the `filename.ts` module.

## Symbols

### `describe("hive partition path", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function. It contains multiple test cases to verify different aspects of the function's behavior.

### `it("full", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function with all parameters provided and second-level date granularity.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges input parameters (cxId, patientId, keys, date, dateGranularity).
2. Acts by calling `createHivePartitionFilePath` with the arranged parameters.
3. Asserts that the result matches the expected target path.

### `it("full - minute granularity", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function with minute-level date granularity.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the "full" test, but with "minute" dateGranularity and an expected path without seconds.

### `it("full - hour granularity", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function with hour-level date granularity.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to previous tests, but with "hour" dateGranularity and an expected path without minutes and seconds.

### `it("full - day granularity (arg)", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function with day-level date granularity explicitly set.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to previous tests, but with "day" dateGranularity and an expected path with only the date.

### `it("full - day granularity (no arg)", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function with default day-level date granularity (no explicit argument).

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous test, but without specifying the dateGranularity parameter.

### `it("full-uppercase", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function with uppercase keys in the input.

#### Internal Logic
Uses uppercase keys in the input and verifies that the output path has lowercase key names.

### `it("no date", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function without providing a date parameter.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the function without a date parameter and verifies that the resulting path doesn't include date-related components.

### `it("no keys", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function without providing keys.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the function without the keys parameter and verifies that the resulting path doesn't include key-value pairs.

### `it("no date no keys", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `createHivePartitionFilePath` function without providing date or keys.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the function with only cxId and patientId, verifying that the resulting path contains only these two components.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the Jest testing framework, as evidenced by the use of `describe`, `it`, and `expect` functions.
