## High-level description
This directory contains code related to document handling and file management in a healthcare system. It provides utility functions for creating standardized file names, paths, and structures for medical documents and their metadata. The code ensures consistent naming conventions and organization of files in a cloud storage system, which is crucial for efficient data management in healthcare applications.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory performs several key functions:

1. It generates standardized file names for medical documents based on document IDs and MIME types.
2. It creates full file paths for documents, incorporating customer IDs, patient IDs, and document names.
3. It defines a structure for organizing uploaded documents and their metadata in a cloud storage system.
4. It provides utility functions for creating file paths for both uploaded documents and their associated metadata files.
5. It defines constants for common folder names and file suffixes used in the system, such as "uploads" folder and suffixes for Continuity of Care Documents (CCD) and FHIR Bundles.

These functions work together to ensure that all medical documents and their metadata are stored in a consistent, organized manner. This organization is crucial for easy retrieval, management, and processing of medical data in the healthcare system.

## Key Files

### filename.ts
This file contains functions for creating file names and paths for medical documents. Key functions include:

- `createDocumentFileName`: Generates a file name for a medical document using the document ID and optional MIME type.
- `createDocumentFilePath`: Creates a full file path for a medical document, including customer ID, patient ID, and document file name.

These functions ensure consistent naming conventions across the application, making it easier to manage and retrieve documents.

### upload.ts
This file defines constants and functions related to file path creation for document uploads. Key elements include:

- Constants: `UPLOADS_FOLDER`, `CCD_SUFFIX`, and `FHIR_BUNDLE_SUFFIX` for standardized naming.
- `createUploadFilePath`: Generates a file path for an uploaded document.
- `createUploadMetadataFilePath`: Generates a file path for the metadata of an uploaded document.

These functions and constants work together to create a structured file system for uploaded documents and their metadata.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several internal dependencies:

1. `@metriport/core/util/mime`: Provides the `getFileExtension` function for determining file extensions based on MIME types.
2. `@metriport/core/domain/filename`: Offers the `createFilePath`, `createFileName`, and `createFolderName` functions for standardized file and folder naming.

These dependencies are crucial for maintaining consistency in file naming and organization across the application.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the code uses several constants that act as configuration values:

- `UPLOADS_FOLDER`: Set to "uploads", defines the name of the folder where uploaded documents are stored.
- `CCD_SUFFIX`: Set to "ccd", used as a suffix for Continuity of Care Document files.
- `FHIR_BUNDLE_SUFFIX`: Set to "FHIR_BUNDLE", used as a suffix for FHIR Bundle files.

These constants can be easily modified to change the file organization structure if needed.

In summary, this directory contains essential code for managing medical documents in a cloud-based healthcare system. It provides a robust framework for organizing, naming, and storing both documents and their metadata, which is crucial for maintaining an efficient and easily navigable medical record system.
