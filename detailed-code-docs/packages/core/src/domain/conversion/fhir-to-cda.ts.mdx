## High-level description
This code defines an `Input` type for a FHIR to CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) conversion process. It specifies the structure of the input data required for the conversion, including a customer ID, a flag for splitting compositions, a FHIR bundle, and an organization OID.

## Symbols

### `Input`
#### Description
`Input` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure of the input data required for the FHIR to CDA conversion process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cxId | string | Customer ID |
| splitCompositions | boolean | Flag indicating whether to split compositions |
| bundle | Bundle | FHIR Bundle containing the data to be converted |
| orgOid | string | Organization OID (Object Identifier) |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @medplum/fhirtypes | Provides the `Bundle` type used in the `Input` type definition |

## References
This code is referenced and used in the `FhirToCdaConverterLambda` class in the file `packages/api/src/external/fhir-to-cda-converter/connector-lambda.ts`. The `Input` type is used to structure the input data for the Lambda function that performs the FHIR to CDA conversion.

## Notes
1. The `Input` type is crucial for maintaining a consistent interface between different parts of the application that deal with FHIR to CDA conversion.
2. The `Bundle` type is imported from `@medplum/fhirtypes`, which suggests that the application is using the Medplum library for FHIR data structures.
3. The `splitCompositions` flag indicates that there might be an option to split the resulting CDA documents into multiple compositions, which could be useful for handling large or complex FHIR bundles.
4. The `orgOid` field suggests that the conversion process might need to include organization-specific information in the resulting CDA document.

This type definition plays a key role in the FHIR to CDA conversion process, ensuring that all necessary data is provided in a structured manner for the conversion to take place.
