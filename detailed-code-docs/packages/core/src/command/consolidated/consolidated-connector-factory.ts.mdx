## High-level description
This code defines a factory function `buildConsolidatedDataConnector()` that creates and returns an instance of a `ConsolidatedDataConnector` based on the current environment (development or production). It uses the `Config` utility to determine the environment and create the appropriate connector implementation.

## Code Structure
The main function `buildConsolidatedDataConnector()` uses the `Config` utility to check the environment and create either a `ConsolidatedDataConnectorLocal` or `ConsolidatedDataConnectorLambda` instance. These classes implement the `ConsolidatedDataConnector` interface.

## References
- `Config` from "../../util/config"
- `ConsolidatedDataConnector` from "./consolidated-connector"
- `ConsolidatedDataConnectorLambda` from "./consolidated-connector-lambda"
- `ConsolidatedDataConnectorLocal` from "./consolidated-connector-local"

## Symbols

### `buildConsolidatedDataConnector()`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an instance of `ConsolidatedDataConnector` based on the current environment.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | ConsolidatedDataConnector | An instance of either ConsolidatedDataConnectorLocal or ConsolidatedDataConnectorLambda |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the environment is development using `Config.isDev()`.
2. If in development:
   - Gets the medical documents bucket name using `Config.getMedicalDocumentsBucketName()`.
   - Gets the API URL using `Config.getApiUrl()`.
   - Creates and returns a new `ConsolidatedDataConnectorLocal` instance with the bucket name and API URL.
3. If not in development (i.e., production):
   - Creates and returns a new `ConsolidatedDataConnectorLambda` instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/core/util/config | Provides configuration utilities through the `Config` class |
| ./consolidated-connector | Defines the `ConsolidatedDataConnector` interface |
| ./consolidated-connector-lambda | Implements `ConsolidatedDataConnector` for Lambda environments |
| ./consolidated-connector-local | Implements `ConsolidatedDataConnector` for local development |

This code is part of a larger system for handling consolidated data connectors, providing a factory method to create the appropriate connector based on the environment. It abstracts the environment-specific implementation details from the rest of the application, allowing for easier switching between local development and production Lambda-based setups.
