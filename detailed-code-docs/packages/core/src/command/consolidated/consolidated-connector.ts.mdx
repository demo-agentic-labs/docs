## High-level description
This code defines types and interfaces for handling consolidated patient data requests and responses in a medical data system. It provides a structure for both synchronous and asynchronous data requests, as well as a connector interface for executing these requests.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are types and interfaces that relate to each other in a hierarchical manner. `ConsolidatedPatientDataRequest` serves as a base type, which is extended by `ConsolidatedDataRequestAsync` and `ConsolidatedDataRequestSync`. The `ConsolidatedDataConnector` interface defines the contract for executing these requests.

## Symbols

### `ConsolidatedPatientDataRequest`
#### Description
This type represents the basic structure of a consolidated patient data request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| generateAiBrief | boolean | Optional flag to generate an AI brief |

#### Internal Logic
This type extends `ConsolidatedFhirToBundlePayload`, which likely contains additional fields related to patient data and filtering options.

### `ConsolidatedDataRequestAsync`
#### Description
Represents an asynchronous consolidated data request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isAsync | true | Indicates that this is an async request |
| requestId | string | Unique identifier for the request |
| conversionType | ConsolidationConversionType \| undefined | Optional type of conversion to be applied |

#### Internal Logic
This type extends `ConsolidatedPatientDataRequest`, adding fields specific to asynchronous requests.

### `ConsolidatedDataRequestSync`
#### Description
Represents a synchronous consolidated data request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isAsync | false | Indicates that this is a sync request |
| requestId | string \| undefined | Optional unique identifier for the request |

#### Internal Logic
This type extends `ConsolidatedPatientDataRequest`, adding fields specific to synchronous requests.

### `ConsolidatedDataResponse`
#### Description
Defines the structure of the response for a consolidated data request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bundleLocation | string | Location of the resulting data bundle |
| bundleFilename | string | Filename of the resulting data bundle |

### `ConsolidatedDataConnector`
#### Description
An interface that defines the contract for executing consolidated data requests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | ConsolidatedDataRequestSync \| ConsolidatedDataRequestAsync | The request parameters |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;ConsolidatedDataResponse&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves to the consolidated data response |

#### Internal Logic
The `execute` method is responsible for processing the request and returning the consolidated data response.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @metriport/api-sdk | Imports `ConsolidationConversionType` type |
| ../../external/fhir/consolidated/consolidated | Imports `ConsolidatedFhirToBundlePayload` type |

This code provides a structured approach to handling consolidated patient data requests, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous processing. It defines clear interfaces and types that can be implemented and used across different parts of the system to ensure consistency in data handling and processing.
