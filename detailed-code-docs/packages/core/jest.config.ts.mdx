title: "jest.config.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file configures Jest for testing a TypeScript project. It sets up different configurations for end-to-end (E2E) tests and regular unit tests, specifying the test environment, file patterns, and setup files.

## Symbols

### `config`
#### Description
This constant defines the Jest configuration object, which is of type `JestConfigWithTsJest`. It sets various options for running tests in the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This symbol doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a configuration object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | JestConfigWithTsJest | The Jest configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the preset to "ts-jest" for TypeScript support.
2. Configures the test environment as "node".
3. Enables verbose output.
4. Ignores test files in "/node_modules/" and "/dist/" directories.
5. Sets different test file patterns based on whether it's an E2E test or not.
6. Specifies a setup file to run after the test environment is set up.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ts-jest | Provides TypeScript support for Jest |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| preset | string | "ts-jest" | Specifies the Jest preset to use |
| testEnvironment | string | "node" | Sets the test environment to Node.js |
| verbose | boolean | true | Enables verbose output during test execution |
| testPathIgnorePatterns | string[] | ["/node_modules/", "/dist/"] | Specifies patterns for test files to ignore |
| testMatch | string[] | Conditional | Defines patterns to match test files |
| setupFilesAfterEnv | string[] | ["./src/__tests__/env-setup.ts"] | Specifies files to run after the test environment is set up |

## Side Effects
The script sets the `ENV_TYPE` environment variable to "dev":
```typescript
process.env.ENV_TYPE = "dev";
```

This may affect the behavior of tests or the application being tested, depending on how this environment variable is used elsewhere in the project.

## Error Handling
This configuration file does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms.

## Notes
1. The configuration uses a conditional statement to determine whether to run E2E tests or regular tests:
   ```typescript
   const isE2E = process.env.E2E === "true";
   ```
   This allows for different test file patterns to be used based on the `E2E` environment variable.

2. The `testMatch` option is set conditionally:
   - For E2E tests: `["**/__tests__/**/(*.)+(spec|test).e2e.[jt]s?(x)"]`
   - For regular tests: `["**/__tests__/**/(*.)+(spec|test).[jt]s?(x)"]`

3. The configuration is exported as the default export, allowing it to be easily imported and used in other parts of the project.
