title: ".eslintrc.js"

## High-level description
This file, `.eslintrc.js`, is a configuration file for ESLint, a popular JavaScript and TypeScript linting tool. It defines the linting rules and settings for the `@metriport/core` package, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single configuration object that extends recommended ESLint configurations and sets up TypeScript-specific linting rules.

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported by the file. It defines the ESLint settings for the project.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object includes the following key properties:

1. `extends`: An array of preset configurations to extend from.
2. `parser`: Specifies the parser to be used for linting.
3. `plugins`: An array of ESLint plugins to be used.
4. `root`: A boolean flag indicating this is the root configuration file.

Let's break down each property:

1. `extends`:
   - `'eslint:recommended'`: Uses ESLint's recommended rules.
   - `'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'`: Extends recommended rules for TypeScript.
   - `'prettier'`: Integrates with Prettier for code formatting.

2. `parser`: Set to `'@typescript-eslint/parser'`, which allows ESLint to understand TypeScript syntax.

3. `plugins`: Includes `'@typescript-eslint'`, which provides additional TypeScript-specific linting rules.

4. `root`: Set to `true`, indicating that ESLint should stop looking for configuration files in parent directories.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @typescript-eslint/parser | Allows ESLint to parse TypeScript code |
| @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin | Provides TypeScript-specific linting rules |
| eslint-config-prettier | Disables ESLint rules that might conflict with Prettier |

Note: These dependencies are not explicitly imported in this file but are required for the configuration to work properly. They are listed in the `devDependencies` section of the `package.json` file.

## Performance Considerations
This configuration is lightweight and should not have significant performance implications. However, enabling TypeScript-specific linting may slightly increase linting time compared to standard JavaScript linting.

## Related Information
The `package.json` file in the same directory (`packages/core/`) includes scripts for running ESLint:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "npx eslint . --ext .ts",
  "lint-fix": "npm run lint --fix"
}
```

These scripts can be used to run ESLint on the project files and automatically fix some linting issues.
