## High-level description

This file, `tsconfig.build.json`, is a TypeScript configuration file specifically tailored for building the react-native-sdk package. It extends the base TypeScript configuration and excludes the "example" directory from the build process.

## Code Structure

The JSON configuration file contains two main properties:

1. `"extends"`: Specifies the base configuration file to extend.
2. `"exclude"`: Defines an array of patterns to exclude from the compilation.

## Symbols

### extends
#### Description
This property indicates that the current configuration extends another TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | The path to the base configuration file |

In this case, the value `"./tsconfig"` suggests that there is a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory, which serves as the base configuration.

### exclude
#### Description
This property specifies an array of glob patterns that should be excluded from compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exclude | string[] | An array of glob patterns to exclude |

In this configuration, it excludes the "example" directory from the build process. This is likely done to separate the main package code from any example or demo code that might be present in the project.

## Dependencies

This configuration file indirectly depends on the presence of a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory, as indicated by the `"extends"` property.

## Configuration

This `tsconfig.build.json` file is itself a configuration file, specifically for TypeScript compilation during the build process of the react-native-sdk package. It modifies the base configuration by excluding the "example" directory.

The purpose of having a separate `tsconfig.build.json` file is to provide a specific configuration for building the package, which may differ from the configuration used during development or for running examples.

By extending the base `tsconfig.json` and excluding the "example" directory, this configuration ensures that only the core package code is compiled during the build process, potentially reducing build time and avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary files in the final package.
