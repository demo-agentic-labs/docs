title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.ref.json`) is specifically designed for the React Native SDK package. It extends the base configuration from `tsconfig.json` and sets up additional compiler options for building a composite project, including all TypeScript files in the `src` directory.

## Code Structure
The configuration file consists of a single JSON object with three main properties: `extends`, `include`, and `compilerOptions`.

## References
This file is referenced in the main `tsconfig.json` file of the project, which includes it as part of a larger TypeScript project structure.

### Root Configuration Object
#### Description
The root object defines the TypeScript compiler configuration for the React Native SDK package.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base configuration from `tsconfig.json`.
2. Includes all TypeScript files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories.
3. Sets additional compiler options specific to this package.

### `extends`
#### Description
Specifies the base configuration file to extend from.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| extends | string | Path to the base configuration file |

#### Internal Logic
Inherits all configuration options from `./tsconfig.json` and allows overriding or adding new options in this file.

### `include`
#### Description
Specifies which files should be included in the compilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include | array of strings | Glob patterns for files to include |

#### Internal Logic
Includes all files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories, typically covering all source files for the React Native SDK.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
Specifies additional compiler options for this package.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| composite | boolean | Enables TypeScript's composite project mode |

#### Internal Logic
Sets `composite` to `true`, which enables features for building larger TypeScript projects that consist of multiple subprojects.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on the existence of a `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory, which it extends.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| composite | boolean | true | Enables TypeScript's composite project mode |

## Notes
1. This configuration is part of a larger TypeScript project structure, as evidenced by its inclusion in the main `tsconfig.json` file's `references` array.
2. The use of `composite: true` suggests that this package is designed to be built as part of a larger TypeScript project, allowing for faster incremental builds and better project organization.
3. The configuration focuses solely on the `src` directory, implying that all source code for the React Native SDK should be located there.
4. By extending the base `tsconfig.json`, this configuration inherits common settings while allowing for package-specific overrides or additions.
