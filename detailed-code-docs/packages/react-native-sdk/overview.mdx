## High-level description
This directory contains the React Native SDK for Metriport, which provides a widget component for integrating Metriport's functionality into React Native applications. The SDK supports both iOS and Android platforms, with platform-specific implementations for optimal performance and user experience.

## What does it do?
The Metriport React Native SDK allows developers to embed a widget in their React Native applications that connects with available providers. The main features include:

1. A cross-platform `MetriportWidget` component that adapts to iOS and Android:
   - On iOS, it uses a native widget for better performance and integration.
   - On Android, it uses a WebView to display the widget.

2. Customization options for the widget, including:
   - Authentication with client API key and token
   - Sandbox mode for testing
   - Color mode and custom color options
   - Ability to specify providers
   - Custom URLs for the widget and API

3. Platform-specific optimizations for iOS and Android.

4. Error handling for cases where the native module is not properly linked on iOS.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SDK is the `src/index.tsx` file, which exports the `MetriportWidget` component. This component serves as the primary interface for developers integrating Metriport's functionality into their React Native applications.

The code is organized conceptually as follows:

1. Definition of props and interfaces (`MetriportWidgetProps`)
2. Platform-specific implementations:
   - Native widget for iOS
   - WebView-based solution for Android
3. Main `MetriportWidget` component that chooses the appropriate implementation based on the platform

Data flow:
1. Developers provide configuration and customization through props to the `MetriportWidget` component.
2. The component determines the platform and renders the appropriate implementation.
3. For iOS, data is passed directly to the native widget.
4. For Android, data is encoded into a URL and passed to the WebView.

## Key Files
1. `src/index.tsx`: The main entry point of the SDK, containing the `MetriportWidget` component implementation.
2. `ios/MetriportConfiguration.h`: Defines the `MetriportConfiguration` class for iOS-specific functionality.
3. `ios/MetriportReactNative-Bridging-Header.h`: Bridging header for Objective-C and Swift communication.
4. `package.json`: Defines the package configuration, dependencies, and scripts.
5. `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json`: TypeScript configuration files for development and building.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on the following external libraries:

1. react-native (core dependency)
   - Purpose: Provides the fundamental React Native components and APIs.

2. react-native-webview
   - Purpose: Provides the WebView component used for the Android implementation.
   - Version: ^11.26.1

These dependencies were chosen to ensure cross-platform compatibility and to leverage native capabilities where possible (iOS) while providing a fallback solution using WebView (Android).

## Configuration
The SDK uses the following configuration options, passed as props to the `MetriportWidget` component:

1. `clientApiKey` (string): API key for client authentication
2. `token` (string): Authentication token
3. `sandbox` (boolean): Flag to indicate sandbox mode
4. `colorMode` (string, optional): Color mode for the widget
5. `customColor` (string, optional): Custom color for the widget
6. `providers` (array of strings, optional): Array of provider strings
7. `url` (string, optional): Custom URL for the widget
8. `apiUrl` (string, optional): Custom API URL
9. `style` (ViewStyle): Style object for the widget

These configuration options allow developers to customize the behavior and appearance of the Metriport widget within their React Native applications.

The project uses TypeScript for development, with configuration files (`tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json`) specifying compiler options and project settings to ensure type safety and enable specific features.
