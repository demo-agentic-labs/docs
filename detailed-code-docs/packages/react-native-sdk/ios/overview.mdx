## High-level description

This directory contains the iOS-specific implementation of the Metriport React Native SDK. It includes configuration files and bridging headers necessary for integrating the SDK with iOS applications and enabling communication between Objective-C, Swift, and React Native components.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory serves several purposes:

1. It provides a configuration interface for the Metriport SDK, specifically for handling background updates in iOS applications.
2. It sets up the necessary bridging between Objective-C and Swift code, allowing the SDK to leverage both languages in its implementation.
3. It imports React Native components, enabling the creation and management of custom native UI elements that can be used in React Native applications.

The main functionality revolves around the `MetriportConfiguration` class, which includes a method for checking background updates. This is typically used when an iOS application launches, ensuring that the Metriport SDK is properly set up and can perform necessary background tasks.

## Key Files

1. **MetriportConfiguration.h**
   This header file defines the `MetriportConfiguration` class, which is central to the SDK's functionality on iOS. It declares a single class method `checkBackgroundUpdates`, which is likely responsible for initiating or managing background update checks for the Metriport SDK.

   Example usage in Objective-C:
   ```objc
   [MetriportConfiguration checkBackgroundUpdates];
   ```

   Example usage in Swift:
   ```swift
   MetriportClient.checkBackgroundUpdates()
   ```

2. **MetriportReactNative-Bridging-Header.h**
   This bridging header file is crucial for enabling communication between Objective-C and Swift code within the project. It imports the necessary React Native headers, specifically `RCTViewManager.h`, which allows the SDK to create and manage custom native UI components that can be used in React Native applications.

## Dependencies

The main external dependency for this directory is the React Native framework. Specifically, it relies on:

- React Native's `RCTViewManager.h`: This is used for creating and managing custom native UI components that can be used in React Native applications.

The code also depends on the Foundation framework, as indicated by the import statement in `MetriportConfiguration.h`:

```objc
#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
```

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `MetriportConfiguration` class serves as a configuration interface for the SDK. The `checkBackgroundUpdates` method is likely used to set up or verify configuration settings related to background updates when the app launches.

Developers integrating this SDK into their iOS applications would typically call the `checkBackgroundUpdates` method in their app's `AppDelegate`, specifically in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method. This ensures that the necessary background update checks are performed at app launch.

It's worth noting that there seems to be a discrepancy between the class names used in Objective-C (`MetriportConfiguration`) and Swift (`MetriportClient`) examples. This could indicate that there might be a Swift-specific wrapper or that the class name has been changed in a more recent version of the SDK. Developers should be aware of this potential difference when integrating the SDK into their projects.

In summary, this directory contains the core iOS-specific components of the Metriport React Native SDK, providing the necessary interfaces and configurations for seamless integration with iOS applications and React Native projects.
