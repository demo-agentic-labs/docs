title: "MetriportConfiguration.h"

## High-level description
This code defines a simple Objective-C interface for a class called `MetriportConfiguration`. The class provides a single class method `checkBackgroundUpdates` which is likely used to manage background update checks for the Metriport SDK in iOS applications.

## Symbols

### `MetriportConfiguration`
#### Description
`MetriportConfiguration` is an Objective-C class that inherits from `NSObject`. It serves as a configuration interface for the Metriport SDK, specifically for handling background updates.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any explicit outputs.

### `+checkBackgroundUpdates`
#### Description
This is a class method (denoted by the `+` sign) named `checkBackgroundUpdates`. It is likely responsible for initiating or managing background update checks for the Metriport SDK.

#### Inputs
This method does not take any parameters.

#### Outputs
The method's return type is not specified, which in Objective-C implies a return type of `id` (a generic object pointer). However, based on its usage in the related code snippets, it's likely that this method doesn't return anything (void).

#### Internal Logic
The internal implementation of this method is not provided in the header file. Its functionality would be defined in the corresponding `.m` implementation file.

## References
The `MetriportConfiguration` class and its `checkBackgroundUpdates` method are referenced in the related code snippets, specifically in the context of setting up an iOS application's `AppDelegate`.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the Foundation framework, as indicated by the import statement:
```objc
#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
```

## Usage
Based on the related code snippets, the `checkBackgroundUpdates` method is typically called in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method of the app's `AppDelegate`. This suggests that it performs some necessary setup or check for background updates when the app launches.

For Objective-C:
```objc
[MetriportConfiguration checkBackgroundUpdates];
```

For Swift:
```swift
MetriportClient.checkBackgroundUpdates()
```

Note that in the Swift example, the class name is different (`MetriportClient` instead of `MetriportConfiguration`). This could indicate that there might be a Swift-specific wrapper or that the class name has been changed in a more recent version of the SDK.
