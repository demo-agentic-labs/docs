## High-level description

This file, `MetriportReactNative-Bridging-Header.h`, is a bridging header for the Metriport React Native SDK on iOS. Its purpose is to import necessary React Native headers to enable communication between Objective-C and Swift code within the project.

## Symbols

### `#import &lt;React/RCTViewManager.h&gt;`

#### Description

This line imports the `RCTViewManager.h` header from the React Native framework. The `RCTViewManager` class is a crucial component in React Native's bridge between JavaScript and native iOS code.

#### Purpose

The `RCTViewManager` is used to create and manage custom native UI components that can be used in React Native applications. By importing this header, the Metriport React Native SDK can create custom native views and expose them to the JavaScript side of a React Native application.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React Native | Provides the `RCTViewManager.h` header for bridging native iOS components with React Native |

## Notes

1. This bridging header is specifically for iOS and is used to expose Objective-C headers to Swift code in the project.
2. The presence of this file suggests that the Metriport React Native SDK likely contains Swift code that needs to interact with React Native's Objective-C based APIs.
3. While only one header is imported in this file, additional headers could be added here if more React Native or third-party Objective-C APIs need to be exposed to Swift code in the future.
4. The use of `RCTViewManager.h` implies that the SDK might be creating custom native UI components for use in React Native applications.
