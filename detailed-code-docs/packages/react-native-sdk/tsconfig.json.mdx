## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a React Native SDK project. It defines compiler options and project settings to ensure type safety, enable specific features, and configure the TypeScript compilation process for the project.

## Code Structure
The configuration extends a recommended TypeScript configuration and includes custom compiler options, strict type-checking rules, and project-specific settings.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object contains various compiler options that control the TypeScript compilation process and enforce coding standards.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the recommended TypeScript configuration.
2. Sets the target ECMAScript version to ES2020.
3. Enables source map generation and declaration file output.
4. Configures decorator metadata and experimental decorators.
5. Specifies React and Jest types.
6. Incorporates strict type-checking rules from @tsconfig/strictest.
7. Sets the output directory to "./lib".
8. Configures module resolution and import/export behavior.
9. Enables JSX support for React.
10. Enforces various coding standards and type safety measures.

### include
#### Description
Specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Includes all files in the "./src" directory.

### exclude
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Excludes the "lib" directory, "node_modules" directory, and any files in "__tests__" directories.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tsconfig/recommended | Provides a base recommended TypeScript configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| target | string | "es2020" | Specifies the ECMAScript target version |
| sourceMap | boolean | true | Enables generation of source map files |
| declaration | boolean | true | Generates corresponding .d.ts files |
| emitDecoratorMetadata | boolean | true | Enables experimental support for emitting type metadata for decorators |
| experimentalDecorators | boolean | true | Enables experimental support for decorators |
| types | array | ["react", "jest"] | Specifies type declaration files to be included in compilation |
| outDir | string | "./lib" | Redirects output structure to the directory |
| paths | object | \{ "metriport-react-native": ["./src/index"] \} | Specifies path mapping to be computed relative to baseUrl |
| jsx | string | "react-jsx" | Specifies the JSX factory function to use when targeting React JSX emit |

Note: The configuration also includes several strict type-checking options and other compiler flags to enforce code quality and type safety.
