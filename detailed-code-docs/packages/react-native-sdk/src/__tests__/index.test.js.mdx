## High-level description
This file is a placeholder for unit tests for the React Native SDK. It currently contains a single test case marked as "todo", indicating that actual test implementation is pending.

## Symbols

### `it.todo('write a test')`
#### Description
This is a Jest test placeholder using the `it.todo()` function. It serves as a reminder to write a test for the React Native SDK in the future.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `it.todo()` function is part of Jest's testing framework. It doesn't execute any test code but marks this test as something that needs to be implemented. When the test suite is run, this will be reported as a pending test.

## TODOs
- Implement actual test cases for the React Native SDK.

This file is currently a minimal setup for future testing of the React Native SDK. It uses Jest's `it.todo()` function to indicate that test implementation is needed. The "use strict" directive at the beginning enforces stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript.

To make this test file useful, developers should replace the `it.todo()` with actual test cases that verify the functionality of the React Native SDK. These tests might include checking initialization, API calls, event handling, and other relevant features of the SDK.
