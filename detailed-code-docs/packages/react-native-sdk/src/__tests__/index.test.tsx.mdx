## High-level description
This file contains a placeholder test for a React Native SDK. It uses the Jest testing framework's `it.todo()` function to indicate that a test needs to be written in the future.

## Symbols

### `it.todo("write a test")`
#### Description
This is a Jest test placeholder. It serves as a reminder that a test needs to be implemented for some functionality in the React Native SDK.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `it.todo()` function is provided by Jest and doesn't execute any actual test logic. It's used to mark a test that needs to be written in the future. When the test suite is run, this will be reported as a pending test.

## TODOs
- Write an actual test to replace the placeholder.

This file is extremely minimal and serves primarily as a starting point for future test development. It indicates that the project is set up for testing using Jest, but the actual tests for the React Native SDK have not yet been implemented.
