## High-level description

This directory, `packages/react-native-sdk/src/__tests__`, is dedicated to unit tests for a React Native SDK. Currently, it contains placeholder test files that serve as a foundation for future test implementation. The directory is set up to use Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework.

## What does it do?

At present, this directory doesn't perform any actual testing. Instead, it provides a structure and reminder for developers to implement tests for the React Native SDK in the future. The placeholder tests use Jest's `it.todo()` function, which marks tests as pending without executing any code. This approach allows developers to outline the tests they intend to write without immediately implementing them.

## Key Files

1. `index.test.js`:
   - A JavaScript file containing a placeholder test for the React Native SDK.
   - Uses the "use strict" directive for stricter JavaScript parsing and error handling.

2. `index.test.tsx`:
   - A TypeScript file also containing a placeholder test for the React Native SDK.
   - Identical in functionality to `index.test.js`, but uses TypeScript syntax.

Both files currently contain the same placeholder test:

```javascript
it.todo('write a test');
```

## Dependencies

The test files implicitly depend on Jest, a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. Jest is commonly used for testing React and React Native applications due to its simplicity and powerful features.

## Configuration

No specific configuration is visible in these files. However, to run these tests, you would typically need:

1. Jest configuration in the project's `package.json` or a separate `jest.config.js` file.
2. Appropriate TypeScript configuration for the `.tsx` file, likely defined in a `tsconfig.json` file in the project root or a parent directory.

## TODOs

The primary TODO for this directory is to replace the placeholder tests with actual unit tests for the React Native SDK. These tests should cover:

1. SDK initialization
2. API calls and responses
3. Event handling
4. Error scenarios
5. Integration with React Native components
6. Any specific features or functionalities of the SDK

Developers should aim to create comprehensive test suites that ensure the reliability and correctness of the React Native SDK across various use cases and edge scenarios.

To start implementing these tests, developers should:

1. Replace `it.todo('write a test')` with `it('test description', () =&gt; { ... })` and add the necessary test logic.
2. Import the required components and functions from the SDK.
3. Use Jest's assertion functions (like `expect()`) to verify the behavior of the SDK.
4. Consider using mocking capabilities provided by Jest to isolate the SDK from external dependencies during testing.

Example of how a real test might look:

```typescript
import { initializeSDK, makeAPICall } from '../path-to-sdk';

describe('React Native SDK', () =&gt; {
  it('initializes correctly', () =&gt; {
    const sdk = initializeSDK({ apiKey: 'test-key' });
    expect(sdk).toBeDefined();
    expect(sdk.isInitialized()).toBe(true);
  });

  it('makes API calls successfully', async () =&gt; {
    const response = await makeAPICall('endpoint');
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.data).toHaveProperty('result');
  });
});
```

By implementing thorough tests, developers can ensure the React Native SDK functions correctly and maintains its expected behavior across updates and refactoring.
