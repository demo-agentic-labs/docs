## High-level description
This file contains a simple unit test for the `reactNative` module. It verifies that the module's default export function returns the expected string output.

## Symbols

### `reactNative()`
#### Description
This is the main function being tested. It is imported from the parent directory and is expected to return a specific string.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The string "Hello from reactNative" |

### Test case
#### Description
The test case checks if the `reactNative()` function returns the expected string.

#### Internal Logic
1. Import the `reactNative` module from the parent directory.
2. Import the `assert` module from Node.js core.
3. Call the `reactNative()` function.
4. Use `assert.strictEqual()` to compare the result with the expected string.
5. If the assertion passes, log a success message to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `..` | The parent directory, presumably containing the `reactNative` module being tested |
| `assert` | Node.js core module used for making assertions in the test |

## Error Handling
The test relies on Node.js's built-in assertion mechanism. If the assertion fails, an `AssertionError` will be thrown, causing the test to fail.

## Logging
The test uses `console.info()` to log a success message if the assertion passes.

## TODOs
- The test coverage is minimal, testing only a single case. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for the `reactNative` module.
- The test doesn't use a formal testing framework, which might be beneficial for larger test suites or more complex scenarios.
- There's no explicit error handling or reporting beyond the built-in assertion behavior.
