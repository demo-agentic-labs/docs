title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a Node.js project. It extends a base configuration for Node.js 18 and specifies additional compiler options and file inclusion/exclusion patterns for the TypeScript compiler.

## Symbols

### tsconfig.json
#### Description
This JSON configuration file defines the TypeScript compiler options and project structure for a Node.js-based TypeScript project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends a base configuration for Node.js 18 projects.
2. Specifies the output directory for compiled files.
3. Defines which files to include in the compilation process.
4. Specifies directories to exclude from compilation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tsconfig/node18 | Provides a base TypeScript configuration for Node.js 18 projects |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "@tsconfig/node18/tsconfig.json" | Specifies the base configuration to extend |
| compilerOptions.outDir | string | "./dist" | Sets the output directory for compiled files |
| include | array | ["./src"] | Specifies which files to include in compilation |
| exclude | array | ["dist", "node_modules"] | Specifies which directories to exclude from compilation |

## Notes
1. The configuration extends "@tsconfig/node18/tsconfig.json", which is a community-maintained base configuration for Node.js 18 projects. This approach follows best practices by leveraging pre-defined settings suitable for Node.js 18 environments.

2. The `outDir` compiler option is set to "./dist", indicating that the compiled JavaScript files will be output to a "dist" directory in the project root.

3. The `include` array specifies that only files in the "src" directory should be included in the compilation process.

4. The `exclude` array ensures that the "dist" and "node_modules" directories are not included in the compilation process, which is a common practice to avoid unnecessary compilation of generated files and third-party dependencies.

This configuration sets up a clean separation between source files and compiled output, making it easier to manage the project structure and deployment process.
