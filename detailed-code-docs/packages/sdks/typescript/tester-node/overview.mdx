## High-level description
This directory contains the "tester-node" package, which is part of a TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Metriport Medical API. It includes scripts for testing various API functionalities, configuration files for TypeScript and ESLint, and package management through npm.

## What does it do?
The "tester-node" package provides a set of Node.js scripts that demonstrate and test the usage of the Metriport Medical API SDK. These scripts cover various API operations such as:

1. Creating consolidated patient data
2. Querying consolidated patient information
3. Retrieving document query status
4. Listing patients associated with a facility

These scripts serve as both examples for developers integrating the Metriport Medical API into their applications and as functional tests for the SDK itself.

## Key Files
1. `src/consolidated-create.ts`: Demonstrates creating consolidated patient data using the API.
2. `src/consolidated-query.ts`: Shows how to query consolidated patient data and check query statuses.
3. `src/document-query.ts`: Retrieves the status of a document query for a specific patient.
4. `src/patient-list.ts`: Retrieves information for a single patient and lists all patients for a given facility.
5. `package.json`: Defines the package configuration, dependencies, and scripts for building, linting, and type-checking.
6. `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.ref.json`: Configure TypeScript compilation options for the project.
7. `.eslintrc.js`: Sets up ESLint rules for maintaining code quality and consistency.

## Dependencies
The package relies on several key dependencies:

1. `@metriport/api-sdk` (^7.12.1): Provides the main functionality for interacting with the Metriport Medical API.
2. `@metriport/core` (local package): Contains core functionality shared across the SDK.
3. `dotenv` (^16.0.3): For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
4. `url-join` (4.0.1), `form-data` (4.0.0), `node-fetch` (2.7.0), and `qs` (6.11.2): Utilities for HTTP requests and data manipulation.

Development dependencies include TypeScript, ESLint, and various type definitions to support the development environment.

## Configuration
The package uses environment variables for configuration, which should be set in a `.env` file or provided through the system environment. Key variables include:

- `API_URL`: The base URL for the Metriport API
- `API_KEY`: The API key for authentication
- `PATIENT_ID`: The ID of the patient for various operations
- `FACILITY_ID`: The ID of the facility (used in patient listing)

TypeScript configuration is split between `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.ref.json`, with the latter extending the former and enabling composite project features. This setup allows for efficient compilation and project references.

ESLint is configured in `.eslintrc.js` to use recommended rules for TypeScript and ensure code formatting consistency with Prettier.

In summary, the "tester-node" package provides a comprehensive set of tools and examples for developers working with the Metriport Medical API, ensuring they can effectively integrate and test the API's functionality in their Node.js applications.
