## High-level description

The `packages/sdks/typescript` directory contains the TypeScript SDK for Metriport, a medical API platform. It includes two main subdirectories: `tester-local` and `tester-node`, which provide testing environments and example implementations for the SDK. These components work together to offer a comprehensive toolkit for developers integrating Metriport's medical API into their TypeScript/JavaScript applications.

## What does it do?

This directory provides developers with the tools and examples needed to interact with the Metriport Medical API using TypeScript. It offers:

1. A local testing environment (`tester-local`) for running unit tests and verifying SDK functionality.
2. A Node.js-based tester (`tester-node`) that demonstrates real-world usage of the API through various scripts.
3. Comprehensive testing of SDK features, including patient management, medical record retrieval, and API interactions.
4. Examples of creating and querying consolidated patient data, checking document query statuses, and managing patient information.
5. Configuration setups for TypeScript, Jest, and ESLint to ensure code quality and consistency.

Together, these components allow developers to test, validate, and understand how to implement the Metriport SDK in their projects effectively.

## Key Files

1. `tester-local/__tests__/`: Contains unit tests covering various SDK functionalities.
   - Includes tests for patient creation, medical record retrieval, and webhook payload type verification.

2. `tester-node/src/`:
   - `consolidated-create.ts`: Demonstrates creating consolidated patient data.
   - `consolidated-query.ts`: Shows how to query consolidated patient data and check query statuses.
   - `document-query.ts`: Retrieves document query status for a specific patient.
   - `patient-list.ts`: Retrieves single patient information and lists patients for a facility.

3. Configuration files:
   - `package.json` (in both subdirectories): Defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
   - `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.ref.json`: Configure TypeScript compilation options.
   - `jest.config.js` (in `tester-local`): Configures Jest for TypeScript testing.
   - `.eslintrc.js` (in `tester-node`): Sets up ESLint rules for code quality.

## Dependencies

Both subdirectories share common dependencies, including:

1. `@metriport/api-sdk`: The main SDK for interacting with the Metriport Medical API.
2. `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
3. `form-data`, `node-fetch`, `qs`, and `url-join`: Utilities for HTTP requests and data manipulation.

Development dependencies include TypeScript, Jest (for `tester-local`), ESLint (for `tester-node`), and various type definitions.

## Configuration

Both subdirectories use environment variables for configuration, typically loaded from a `.env` file. Key variables include:

- `API_URL` or `BASE_URL`: The base URL for the Metriport API
- `API_KEY`: The API key for authentication
- `PATIENT_ID`: ID of a test patient
- `FACILITY_ID`: ID of a test facility

TypeScript configuration is managed through `tsconfig.json` files, with `tester-node` using an additional `tsconfig.ref.json` for project references. Both setups ensure strict type-checking and target ES6 with CommonJS modules.

The `tester-local` directory uses Jest for testing, configured in `jest.config.js` to work with TypeScript and run in a Node.js environment. The `tester-node` directory uses ESLint for code quality, configured in `.eslintrc.js` with recommended TypeScript rules and Prettier integration.

These configurations provide a robust development and testing environment for the Metriport TypeScript SDK, ensuring code quality, type safety, and consistent behavior across different use cases.
