## High-level description
The `packages/sdks/typescript/tester-local` directory contains a local testing environment for the Metriport TypeScript SDK. It includes a suite of unit tests, configuration files for TypeScript and Jest, and a package.json file that defines the project structure and dependencies.

## What does it do?
This directory serves as a testing ground for the Metriport SDK, allowing developers to:

1. Run comprehensive unit tests that cover various SDK functionalities, including patient management, medical record retrieval, and API interactions.
2. Verify the correctness of webhook payload types for patient document data and consolidated data.
3. Demonstrate usage examples of the SDK's features.
4. Update and test the generated node SDK locally.

The testing environment is set up with TypeScript and Jest, providing a robust framework for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the SDK.

## Key Files

1. `__tests__/` directory:
   - Contains multiple test files (e.g., `test_create_patient.ts`, `test_get_medical_record.ts`) that cover different aspects of the SDK's functionality.
   - Includes `verify-webhook-types.ts` for testing webhook payload types.

2. `package.json`:
   - Defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
   - Includes scripts for building, formatting, and testing the project.

3. `tsconfig.json`:
   - Configures TypeScript compiler options for the project.
   - Sets strict type-checking and targets ES6 with CommonJS modules.

4. `jest.config.js`:
   - Configures Jest to work with TypeScript and sets the test environment to Node.js.

5. `README.md`:
   - Provides instructions for updating the SDK locally and running tests.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several key dependencies:

1. Runtime dependencies:
   - `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
   - `form-data`: For creating multipart/form-data streams.
   - `js-base64`: For Base64 encoding/decoding.
   - `node-fetch`: For making HTTP requests.
   - `qs`: For parsing and stringifying URL query strings.
   - `url-join`: For joining URL paths.

2. Development dependencies:
   - TypeScript and related type definitions.
   - Jest for testing.
   - Prettier for code formatting.

## Configuration
The project uses several configuration files:

1. `tsconfig.json`:
   - Sets compiler options such as `strict: true`, `target: "ES6"`, and `module: "CommonJS"`.
   - Includes `src` and `__test__` directories for compilation.

2. `jest.config.js`:
   - Uses the `ts-jest` preset for TypeScript support.
   - Sets the test environment to Node.js.

3. Environment variables (loaded via `dotenv`):
   - `BASE_URL`: The base URL for the Metriport API.
   - `API_KEY`: The API key for authentication.
   - `PATIENT_ID`: ID of a test patient.
   - `FACILITY_ID`: ID of a test facility.

These configurations ensure that the testing environment is properly set up for TypeScript development and testing of the Metriport SDK.
