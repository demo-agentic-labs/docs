## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration and dependencies for a TypeScript-based local tester package named "tester-local". It includes scripts for building, formatting, and testing the project, as well as dependencies required for development and runtime.

## Symbols

### Scripts
#### Description
The `scripts` section defines various npm commands that can be run for this project.

#### Internal Logic
- `format`: Uses Prettier to format TypeScript files in the `src` directory.
- `build`: Compiles TypeScript files using the TypeScript compiler (tsc).
- `prepack`: Copies the contents of the `dist` directory to the root directory before packaging.
- `test`: Runs tests using Jest.

### Dependencies
#### Description
The `dependencies` section lists the runtime dependencies required for the project.

#### Internal Logic
Key dependencies include:
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
- `form-data`: For creating multipart/form-data streams.
- `js-base64`: For Base64 encoding/decoding.
- `node-fetch`: For making HTTP requests in Node.js.
- `qs`: For parsing and stringifying URL query strings.
- `url-join`: For joining URL paths.

### DevDependencies
#### Description
The `devDependencies` section lists dependencies required for development and testing.

#### Internal Logic
Key dev dependencies include:
- TypeScript and related type definitions (`@types/*`)
- Jest for testing
- Prettier for code formatting

## Configuration

This package.json file sets up a TypeScript project with necessary dependencies for HTTP requests, testing, and development tools. It's designed to be used as a local tester, possibly for an API or SDK, given the inclusion of HTTP-related libraries.
