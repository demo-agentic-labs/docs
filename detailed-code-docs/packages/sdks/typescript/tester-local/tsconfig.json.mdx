title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for the "tester-local" package within the TypeScript SDK. It defines compiler options and specifies which files should be included or excluded from the TypeScript compilation process.

## Symbols

### CompilerOptions
#### Description
The `compilerOptions` object in the tsconfig.json file specifies various settings for the TypeScript compiler. These options control how the TypeScript code is compiled, what features are enabled, and how strict the type-checking should be.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set as follows:

1. `extendedDiagnostics`: Set to `true`, enabling more detailed diagnostic information during compilation.
2. `strict`: Set to `true`, enabling all strict type-checking options.
3. `target`: Set to `"ES6"`, specifying that the code should be compiled to ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) standards.
4. `module`: Set to `"CommonJS"`, indicating that the code should use the CommonJS module system.
5. `moduleResolution`: Set to `"node"`, specifying that module resolution should follow Node.js conventions.
6. `esModuleInterop`: Set to `true`, enabling interoperability between CommonJS and ES modules.
7. `skipLibCheck`: Set to `true`, skipping type checking of declaration files.
8. `declaration`: Set to `true`, generating corresponding `.d.ts` files for TypeScript files.
9. `noUnusedParameters`: Set to `true`, reporting errors on unused parameters in functions.
10. `outDir`: Set to `"dist"`, specifying the output directory for compiled files.

### Include
#### Description
The `include` array specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Two directories are included:
1. `"src"`: Likely contains the source code files.
2. `"__test__"`: Likely contains test files.

### Exclude
#### Description
The `exclude` array specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
The `exclude` array is empty, meaning no files or directories are explicitly excluded from compilation.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| compilerOptions | object | - | Specifies the compiler options for the TypeScript compiler |
| include | array | - | Specifies which files or directories should be included in compilation |
| exclude | array | - | Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from compilation |

Note: The default values are not applicable in this context as the configuration file explicitly sets these options.

This configuration file sets up a relatively strict TypeScript environment with modern JavaScript features enabled. It includes both source and test files in the compilation process and outputs the compiled files to a "dist" directory.
