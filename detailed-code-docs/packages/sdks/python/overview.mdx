## High-level description
This directory contains the Python SDK for Metriport, a healthcare data integration platform. It includes two main components: a local tester project and a Python tester script. These components are designed to demonstrate the usage of the Metriport API and verify its functionality across various healthcare data operations.

## What does it do?
The Python SDK for Metriport enables developers to interact with the Metriport API, performing a wide range of healthcare data operations. The functionality can be summarized as follows:

1. Patient Management:
   - Create, retrieve, and match patient records
   - Handle patient demographic data

2. Document Handling:
   - Create document references
   - List and retrieve patient documents
   - Initiate bulk document downloads

3. Consolidated Queries:
   - Start and monitor consolidated queries for patient data
   - Retrieve query results and count patient data

4. Organization Management:
   - Create new organizations within the Metriport system

5. API Authentication and Interaction:
   - Authenticate API requests using API keys
   - Make various API calls to the Metriport service
   - Handle API responses and error conditions

The SDK provides a streamlined interface for developers to integrate Metriport's healthcare data services into their Python applications, covering essential aspects of patient data management, document handling, and organizational setup.

## Key Files
1. `tester-local/`:
   - `README.md`: Instructions for SDK regeneration and test execution
   - `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependency management
   - `tests/`: Directory containing various test scripts for different API functionalities

2. `tester-python/`:
   - Contains a Python script demonstrating the creation of an organization using the Metriport Medical API client

These components collectively provide a comprehensive suite of examples and tests for the Metriport Python SDK, covering a wide range of API functionalities and demonstrating proper usage of the SDK for various healthcare data operations.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on several key dependencies:

1. httpx (version 0.21.2 or higher): HTTP client library for API requests
2. pydantic (version 1.9.2 or higher, but less than 2.5.0): Data validation and settings management
3. python-dotenv (version 1.0.0 or higher): Environment variable management
4. fastapi (version 0.109.1 or higher): Web framework for API development

Development dependencies include mypy for static type checking and pytest for testing.

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust HTTP communication, data validation, configuration management, and testing capabilities, which are essential for a reliable and maintainable SDK.

## Configuration
The SDK uses environment variables for configuration, typically loaded from a .env file. Key configuration options include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| API_KEY / METRIPORT_API_KEY | string | API key for authenticating with the Metriport API |
| PATIENT_ID | string | ID of a test patient used in various tests |
| FACILITY_ID | string | ID of a facility used in some tests |
| BASE_URL | string | Base URL for the Metriport API |

The `pyproject.toml` file in the local tester project specifies project metadata and Python version requirements (3.11 or higher).

To set up and run the tests, users need to:
1. Regenerate the Python SDK locally using `fern generate --group test`
2. Install dependencies with `poetry install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run tests using `poetry run pytest tests`

This configuration ensures that developers can easily set up their environment and start using the SDK with minimal friction.
