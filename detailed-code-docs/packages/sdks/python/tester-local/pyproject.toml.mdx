title: "pyproject.toml"
---

## High-level description
This file is a `pyproject.toml` configuration for a Python project named "test". It specifies the project's dependencies, development dependencies, and build system requirements using the Poetry package manager.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following external libraries:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| httpx | HTTP client library for making API requests |
| pydantic | Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations |
| python-dotenv | Loads environment variables from a .env file |
| fastapi | Fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python |

### Development Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mypy | Optional static type checker for Python |
| pytest | Testing framework for Python |

## Configuration

### Project Metadata
| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| name | "test" | The name of the project |
| version | "0.1.0" | The current version of the project |
| description | "" | An empty description for the project |
| authors | ["Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;"] | The author(s) of the project |
| readme | "README.md" | The path to the project's README file |

### Python Version
The project requires Python version 3.11 or higher.

### Build System
The project uses Poetry for dependency management and packaging. The build system configuration is as follows:

| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| requires | ["poetry-core"] | Specifies that Poetry core is required for building |
| build-backend | "poetry.core.masonry.api" | Defines the build backend to be used |

## Notes
1. The project uses specific version constraints for its dependencies:
   - httpx: version 0.21.2 or higher
   - pydantic: version 1.9.2 or higher, but less than 2.5.0
   - python-dotenv: version 1.0.0 or higher
   - fastapi: version 0.109.1 or higher
2. The development dependency mypy is pinned to version 0.971.
3. The project doesn't have a description, which might be added in the future for better documentation.
4. The author information is a placeholder and should be updated with actual project maintainer details.

This configuration sets up a Python project with a focus on API development (given the use of FastAPI) and includes tools for testing and type checking. It's structured to be built and managed using Poetry, a modern Python packaging and dependency management tool.
