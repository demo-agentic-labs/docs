## High-level description
This Java code demonstrates how to create a new medical facility using the Metriport API. It sets up the Metriport client, constructs a facility object with address details, and sends a request to create the facility.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a single `CreateFacility` class with a `main` method that performs the facility creation process.

## Symbols

### `CreateFacility`
#### Description
This class contains the `main` method to demonstrate the creation of a new medical facility using the Metriport API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Load environment variables using Dotenv.
2. Initialize the Metriport client with API key and base URL.
3. Create an Address object with facility location details.
4. Create a BaseFacility object with facility information.
5. Send a request to create the facility using the Metriport API.
6. Print the response to confirm facility creation.

### `main`
#### Description
The entry point of the program that orchestrates the facility creation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | String[] | Command-line arguments (not used in this code) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Load environment variables.
2. Build Metriport client.
3. Create Address object.
4. Create BaseFacility object.
5. Send create facility request.
6. Print response.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| io.github.cdimascio.dotenv.Dotenv | For loading environment variables |
| com.metriport.api.Metriport | Metriport API client |
| com.metriport.api.resources.medical.facility.types.BaseFacility | Represents a medical facility |
| com.metriport.api.resources.commons.types.UsState | Enum for US states |
| com.metriport.api.resources.commons.types.Address | Represents an address |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_KEY | String | N/A | API key for Metriport authentication (loaded from environment) |
| BASE_URL | String | N/A | Base URL for Metriport API (loaded from environment) |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. Any exceptions thrown during the API call will propagate up the call stack.

## Logging
The code uses `System.out.println` to log the response from the facility creation request.
