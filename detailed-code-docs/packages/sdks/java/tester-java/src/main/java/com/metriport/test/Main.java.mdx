title: "Main.java"

## High-level description
This Java code defines the main entry point for a test application that interacts with the Metriport API. It demonstrates various operations such as retrieving organization information, facility information, and patient data using the Metriport SDK.

## Code Structure
The `Main` class contains a single `main` method that serves as the entry point for the application. It includes commented-out calls to different test methods, with only the `GetPatient.getAllPatients(args)` method currently active.

### `Main` class
#### Description
The `Main` class is the entry point for the test application. It imports necessary classes from the Metriport SDK and other required libraries.

#### Internal Logic
The `main` method contains several commented-out method calls, suggesting different test scenarios:
1. `GetOrg.main(args)`: Likely retrieves organization information.
2. `GetFacility.main(args)`: Probably fetches facility information.
3. `CreateFacility.main(args)`: Presumably creates a new facility.
4. `GetPatient.getAllPatients(args)`: Currently active, retrieves all patients.
5. `GetPatient.getSpecificPatient(args)`: Commented out, likely retrieves a specific patient's information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| io.github.cdimascio.dotenv | For loading environment variables from a .env file |
| com.metriport.api.Metriport | Main Metriport API client |
| com.metriport.api.resources.commons.types.Address | Address type for Metriport API |
| com.metriport.api.resources.commons.types.UsState | US State enumeration for Metriport API |
| com.metriport.api.resources.medical.organization.types.OrganizationCreate | Type for creating organizations in Metriport API |
| com.metriport.api.resources.medical.organization.types.OrgType | Organization type enumeration for Metriport API |

## Notes
1. The code is set up for testing various Metriport API functionalities, with most test methods commented out.
2. The active method `GetPatient.getAllPatients(args)` suggests that the current focus is on retrieving all patients' data.
3. The imported classes (e.g., `Address`, `UsState`, `OrganizationCreate`, `OrgType`) are not directly used in the `main` method but are likely used in the referenced test methods.
4. The `Dotenv` import suggests that the application might be using environment variables for configuration, possibly including API keys or other sensitive information.

This code serves as a test harness for various Metriport API operations, allowing developers to easily switch between different test scenarios by commenting or uncommenting specific method calls.
