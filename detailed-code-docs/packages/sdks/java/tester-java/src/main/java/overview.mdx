## High-level description
This directory contains Java code for testing and demonstrating the functionality of the Metriport API using the Metriport SDK. It includes several classes that showcase different operations such as creating and retrieving facilities, getting organization information, and managing patient data.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a set of tools for interacting with the Metriport API, which is likely a healthcare-related service. Here's what each main component does:

1. CreateFacility: Demonstrates how to create a new medical facility using the API.
2. GetFacility: Shows how to retrieve information about existing facilities.
3. GetOrg: Retrieves a list of medical facilities associated with an organization.
4. GetPatient: Provides methods to fetch all patients or a specific patient's details.
5. Main: Serves as the entry point for the test application, allowing easy switching between different API operations.

These components allow developers to test and verify various aspects of the Metriport API, such as managing healthcare facilities, organizations, and patient data.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application is the `Main` class, located in `Main.java`. This class contains a `main` method that can be used to execute different API operations by uncommenting the desired method calls.

The flow of control typically starts in the `Main` class and then branches out to the specific operation classes (CreateFacility, GetFacility, GetOrg, or GetPatient) based on which method call is active.

Data flow in the application generally follows this pattern:
1. Environment variables are loaded using Dotenv.
2. A Metriport client is initialized with the API key and base URL.
3. The client is used to make API calls to perform specific operations.
4. Results are typically printed to the console for verification.

## Key Files
1. CreateFacility.java: Contains logic for creating a new medical facility.
2. GetFacility.java: Implements functionality to retrieve facility information.
3. GetOrg.java: Handles retrieving a list of medical facilities for an organization.
4. GetPatient.java: Provides methods for fetching patient data.
5. Main.java: The main entry point that orchestrates the execution of different API operations.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Metriport SDK: Used for interacting with the Metriport API. The exact version is not specified in the provided code.
2. Dotenv: Used for loading environment variables. The `io.github.cdimascio.dotenv.Dotenv` class is utilized.

These dependencies were likely chosen to simplify API interactions (Metriport SDK) and manage configuration (Dotenv) in a secure and flexible manner.

## Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration, which are typically stored in a `.env` file. The key configuration options include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| API_KEY | String | The API key for authenticating with the Metriport API |
| BASE_URL | String | The base URL for the Metriport API |
| FACILITY_ID | String | Used in GetFacility.java to specify a facility to retrieve |

These environment variables are crucial for the application to function correctly, as they provide the necessary credentials and endpoints for API interactions.

Here's an example of how the configuration is typically loaded and used:

```java
Dotenv dotenv = Dotenv.load();
String apiKey = dotenv.get("API_KEY");
String baseUrl = dotenv.get("BASE_URL");

Metriport client = Metriport.builder()
    .apiKey(apiKey)
    .baseUrl(baseUrl)
    .build();
```

This configuration approach allows for easy management of sensitive information and environment-specific settings without hardcoding them in the source code.
