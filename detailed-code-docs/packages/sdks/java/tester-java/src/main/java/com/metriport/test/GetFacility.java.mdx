title: "GetFacility.java"
---

## High-level description
This Java code demonstrates how to use the Metriport API to retrieve facility information. It uses the Metriport SDK to list all facilities and get details for a specific facility.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single class `GetFacility` with a `main` method that initializes the Metriport client and makes API calls to retrieve facility information.

## Symbols

### `main` method
#### Description
The main entry point of the program. It initializes the Metriport client using environment variables and makes API calls to retrieve facility information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads environment variables using Dotenv.
2. Builds a Metriport client with the API key and base URL from environment variables.
3. Calls the `list()` method to retrieve all facilities.
4. Calls the `get()` method to retrieve a specific facility using its ID from environment variables.
5. Prints the results to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| io.github.cdimascio.dotenv.Dotenv | Used to load environment variables |
| com.metriport.api.Metriport | Metriport SDK for making API calls |

## Configuration
The code uses the following environment variables:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| API_KEY | String | The API key for authenticating with Metriport |
| BASE_URL | String | The base URL for the Metriport API |
| FACILITY_ID | String | The ID of a specific facility to retrieve |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. Any exceptions thrown by the API calls will propagate up and potentially terminate the program.

## Logging
The code uses `System.out.println()` to log the results of the API calls to the console.
