## High-level description
This Java code demonstrates how to use the Metriport API to retrieve a list of medical facilities. It sets up the Metriport client using environment variables for the API key and base URL, then makes a request to list facilities and prints the response.

## Symbols

### `GetOrg` (class)
#### Description
The `GetOrg` class contains the main method to execute the Metriport API request for listing medical facilities.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads environment variables using Dotenv.
2. Builds a Metriport client with the API key and base URL from environment variables.
3. Makes a request to list medical facilities using the Metriport client.
4. Prints the response to the console.

### `main` (method)
#### Description
The `main` method is the entry point of the program, responsible for setting up the Metriport client and executing the API request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | String[] | Command-line arguments (not used in this code) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads environment variables using `Dotenv.load()`.
2. Creates a Metriport client using the builder pattern, setting the API key and base URL from environment variables.
3. Calls the `medical().facility().list()` method on the Metriport client to retrieve the list of facilities.
4. Prints the response to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| io.github.cdimascio.dotenv.Dotenv | Used to load environment variables |
| com.metriport.api.Metriport | The Metriport API client library |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_KEY | String | N/A | The API key for authenticating with the Metriport API |
| BASE_URL | String | N/A | The base URL for the Metriport API |

Note: These configuration options are expected to be set in the environment or a `.env` file.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement explicit error handling. Any exceptions thrown during the API request or response processing will propagate up the call stack.

## Logging
The code uses `System.out.println()` to print the API response to the console. This is a basic form of logging and is not suitable for production environments.
