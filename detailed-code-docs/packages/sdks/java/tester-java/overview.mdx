## High-level description
This directory contains a Java-based test application for the Metriport SDK. It provides a set of tools and examples for interacting with the Metriport API, which appears to be a healthcare-related service. The codebase demonstrates various operations such as managing medical facilities, retrieving organization information, and handling patient data.

## What does it do?
The test application allows developers to:
1. Create new medical facilities
2. Retrieve information about existing facilities
3. Get a list of medical facilities associated with an organization
4. Fetch patient data, either for all patients or a specific patient
5. Easily switch between different API operations for testing purposes

These functionalities help developers verify and test various aspects of the Metriport API, ensuring proper integration and functionality in their applications.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application is the `Main` class in `Main.java`. This class contains a `main` method that serves as the starting point for executing different API operations. Developers can uncomment specific method calls in the `main` method to test different functionalities.

The application's control flow typically starts in the `Main` class and then branches out to specific operation classes (CreateFacility, GetFacility, GetOrg, or GetPatient) based on which method call is active.

Data flow in the application generally follows this pattern:
1. Environment variables are loaded using Dotenv.
2. A Metriport client is initialized with the API key and base URL.
3. The client is used to make API calls to perform specific operations.
4. Results are typically printed to the console for verification.

## Key Files
1. CreateFacility.java: Contains logic for creating a new medical facility.
2. GetFacility.java: Implements functionality to retrieve facility information.
3. GetOrg.java: Handles retrieving a list of medical facilities for an organization.
4. GetPatient.java: Provides methods for fetching patient data.
5. Main.java: The main entry point that orchestrates the execution of different API operations.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Metriport SDK: Used for interacting with the Metriport API. The exact version is not specified in the provided code.
2. Dotenv: Used for loading environment variables. The `io.github.cdimascio.dotenv.Dotenv` class is utilized.
3. SLF4J: Used as the logging API.
4. Logback: Employed as the logging backend, configured with ISO8601 timestamps.
5. JUnit 5: Used for testing.
6. AssertJ: Used for test assertions.

These dependencies were chosen to simplify API interactions (Metriport SDK), manage configuration (Dotenv) in a secure and flexible manner, and provide robust logging and testing capabilities.

## Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration, which are typically stored in a `.env` file. The key configuration options include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| API_KEY | String | The API key for authenticating with the Metriport API |
| BASE_URL | String | The base URL for the Metriport API |
| FACILITY_ID | String | Used in GetFacility.java to specify a facility to retrieve |

These environment variables are crucial for the application to function correctly, as they provide the necessary credentials and endpoints for API interactions.

The project is configured to use UTF-8 encoding, Java 17, and enables reflection on parameters. It also shows deprecated APIs and fails on warnings. The Maven wrapper is included for easier build management.

The build process copies dependencies to `target/lib` and configures the JAR file with a main class and classpath, allowing the resulting JAR to be run with `java -jar`.

To use the application, developers need to update the `API_KEY` property in `com.metriport.test.Main.java` with their Metriport API key, which can be found on the Metriport dashboard under "Developers".
