## High-level description
This JSON file contains Visual Studio Code (VS Code) workspace settings specific to Java development for the "tester-java" project. It configures how VS Code should handle Java build configuration updates.

## Symbols

### `java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration`
#### Description
This setting determines how VS Code should handle updates to the Java project's build configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | string | The mode for updating build configuration |

#### Outputs
This setting doesn't produce an output directly, but it affects how VS Code behaves when changes are made to build configuration files.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration | string | "interactive" | Specifies how VS Code should handle updates to the Java project's build configuration |

The `"interactive"` value for this setting means that when changes are detected in build files (such as pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle), VS Code will prompt the user to decide whether to update the project configuration or not. This allows developers to have control over when and how their project's build configuration is updated within the IDE.

This setting is particularly useful in Java projects where build tool configurations can significantly impact the project structure, dependencies, and compilation process. By setting it to "interactive", it ensures that developers are aware of potential changes and can decide whether to apply them immediately or defer the update to a more convenient time.
