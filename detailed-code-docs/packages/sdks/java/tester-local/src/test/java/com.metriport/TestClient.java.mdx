title: "TestClient.java"

## High-level description
This code defines a test class `TestClient` that demonstrates the usage of the Metriport Java SDK. It initializes the Metriport client with API credentials loaded from environment variables and performs a simple test operation to list patients.

## Symbols

### `TestClient`
#### Description
The `TestClient` class is a JUnit test class that contains a test method to verify the functionality of the Metriport Java SDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads environment variables using the `Dotenv` library.
2. Retrieves API key and base URL from the environment variables.
3. Defines a test method `test_client()` that:
   - Builds a Metriport client instance with the loaded credentials.
   - Calls the `medical().patient().list()` method to retrieve a list of patients.

### `test_client()`
#### Description
A JUnit test method that demonstrates the initialization of the Metriport client and makes a simple API call to list patients.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `Metriport` instance using the builder pattern, setting the API key and base URL.
2. Calls the `medical().patient().list()` method on the Metriport instance to retrieve a list of patients.
3. The response is stored in the `response` variable, but no assertions are made on the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| com.metriport.generated.Metriport | The generated Metriport SDK client |
| org.junit.jupiter.api.Test | JUnit 5 test annotation |
| io.github.cdimascio.dotenv.Dotenv | Library for loading environment variables from a .env file |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_KEY | String | N/A | The API key for authenticating with the Metriport API |
| BASE_URL | String | N/A | The base URL for the Metriport API |

## Notes
1. This test class is likely part of a local testing setup for the Metriport Java SDK, as indicated by the package name `com.metriport` and the location of the file in the `tester-local` directory.
2. The test method doesn't include any assertions, suggesting it's primarily used to verify that the SDK can be initialized and a basic API call can be made without errors.
3. The use of environment variables for API credentials is a good practice for keeping sensitive information out of the source code.
4. The related `fern/generators.yml` file suggests that this test is part of a larger SDK generation process using the Fern API framework, which generates SDKs for multiple languages including Java.
