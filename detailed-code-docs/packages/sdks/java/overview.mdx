## High-level description
This directory contains the Java SDK for the Metriport API, along with testing applications. It provides tools for interacting with Metriport's healthcare-related services, including managing medical facilities, handling patient data, and performing various API operations. The SDK is designed to simplify integration with Metriport's API in Java applications.

## What does it do?
The Java SDK enables developers to:
1. Create and manage medical facilities
2. Retrieve organization information
3. Handle patient data (create, retrieve, match)
4. Create and upload FHIR-compliant DocumentReferences
5. Perform consolidated queries for patient data
6. Interact with various FHIR resources (e.g., Encounter)

The SDK provides a set of classes and methods that abstract the complexities of direct API interactions, allowing developers to easily incorporate Metriport's functionality into their Java applications.

## Entry points
The main entry points for using the SDK are:

1. The `Metriport` class: This is the core client class used to interact with the Metriport API. It's initialized with an API key and base URL.

2. Test applications:
   - `packages/sdks/java/tester-java/Main.java`: A console application demonstrating various SDK functionalities.
   - `packages/sdks/java/tester-local/*.java`: JUnit test classes showcasing different SDK operations.

Developers typically start by initializing the `Metriport` client and then use its methods to perform specific operations. The test applications provide examples of how to use the SDK in different scenarios.

## Key Files
1. `packages/sdks/java/tester-java/Main.java`: The main entry point for the console test application.
2. `packages/sdks/java/tester-java/CreateFacility.java`: Logic for creating new medical facilities.
3. `packages/sdks/java/tester-java/GetFacility.java`: Functionality to retrieve facility information.
4. `packages/sdks/java/tester-java/GetOrg.java`: Handles retrieving organization information.
5. `packages/sdks/java/tester-java/GetPatient.java`: Methods for fetching patient data.
6. `packages/sdks/java/tester-local/TestCreatePatient.java`: Demonstrates patient creation using the SDK.
7. `packages/sdks/java/tester-local/TestMatchPatient.java`: Shows patient matching functionality.
8. `packages/sdks/java/tester-local/TestCreateDocumentReference.java`: Illustrates creation of FHIR-compliant DocumentReferences.
9. `packages/sdks/java/tester-local/TestStartConsolidatedQuery.java`: Demonstrates consolidated querying for patient data.

## Dependencies
The SDK and test applications rely on the following key dependencies:

1. Metriport SDK: The core SDK generated by Fern for interacting with the Metriport API.
2. Dotenv: Used for loading environment variables (`io.github.cdimascio.dotenv.Dotenv`).
3. SLF4J: Logging API.
4. Logback: Logging implementation.
5. JUnit 5: Testing framework.
6. AssertJ: Used for test assertions.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust development environment with proper logging, testing, and configuration management capabilities.

## Configuration
The SDK and test applications use environment variables for configuration, typically stored in a `.env` file. Key configuration options include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| API_KEY | String | The API key for authenticating with the Metriport API |
| BASE_URL | String | The base URL for the Metriport API |
| FACILITY_ID | String | Used in some tests to specify a facility |
| PATIENT_ID | String | Used in some tests to specify a patient |

To use the SDK, developers need to set these environment variables or provide them programmatically when initializing the Metriport client.

The project is configured to use UTF-8 encoding and Java 17. It includes a Maven wrapper for easier build management. The build process copies dependencies to `target/lib` and configures the JAR file with a main class and classpath.

To regenerate the Java SDK locally for testing, run:
```bash
fern generate --group test
```

To run the tests, execute:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

For development, it's recommended to open the java directory in an IDE like IntelliJ to get autocomplete and intellisense support.
