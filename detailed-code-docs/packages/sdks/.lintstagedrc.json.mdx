title: ".lintstagedrc.json"

## High-level description

This file, `.lintstagedrc.json`, is a configuration file for the lint-staged tool. It appears to be set up to ignore all files, effectively disabling lint-staged for this project or directory.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object in this JSON file contains a single key-value pair that configures lint-staged's behavior.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration uses a negation pattern `"!*"` as the key, which matches all files and directories. The empty string value `""` indicates that no command should be run for these matched files.

## Side Effects
This configuration effectively disables lint-staged for all files in the project or directory where this `.lintstagedrc.json` file is located. As a result, no linting or formatting commands will be executed by lint-staged during the pre-commit hook or when manually running lint-staged.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| lint-staged | A tool that runs linters on pre-committed files in git |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| !* | string | "" | Matches all files and directories, instructing lint-staged to do nothing |

## Error Handling
This configuration does not implement any specific error handling. If the JSON is malformed, lint-staged will likely fail to parse the configuration and may fall back to its default behavior or throw an error.

## TODOs
It's worth noting that this configuration effectively disables lint-staged. If this is intentional, it might be helpful to add a comment explaining why lint-staged is disabled for this project or directory. If it's not intentional, the configuration should be reviewed and updated to include the desired linting and formatting commands for specific file types.
