## High-level description

The `packages/sdks` directory contains Software Development Kits (SDKs) for the Metriport API in multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and TypeScript. These SDKs provide developers with language-specific tools and interfaces to interact with Metriport's healthcare data integration platform. The directory includes both the SDK implementations and testing environments for each language.

## What does it do?

The SDKs in this directory enable developers to:

1. Interact with the Metriport API using their preferred programming language (Java, Python, or TypeScript).
2. Perform various healthcare data operations, including:
   - Patient management (create, retrieve, match patients)
   - Document handling (create references, list, retrieve, and download documents)
   - Consolidated queries for patient data
   - Organization management
   - Facility management
3. Authenticate API requests using API keys
4. Handle API responses and error conditions
5. Test SDK functionality through provided testing environments and example implementations

These SDKs abstract the complexities of direct API interactions, allowing developers to easily integrate Metriport's healthcare data services into their applications.

## Entry points

Each language-specific SDK has its own entry points:

1. Java SDK:
   - `packages/sdks/java/tester-java/Main.java`: Console application demonstrating SDK functionalities
   - `Metriport` class: Core client class for API interactions

2. Python SDK:
   - `packages/sdks/python/tester-local/tests/`: Directory containing test scripts for various API functionalities
   - `packages/sdks/python/tester-python/`: Contains a script demonstrating organization creation

3. TypeScript SDK:
   - `packages/sdks/typescript/tester-local/__tests__/`: Unit tests covering SDK functionalities
   - `packages/sdks/typescript/tester-node/src/`: Example scripts demonstrating real-world usage

## Key Files

1. Java SDK:
   - `packages/sdks/java/tester-java/*.java`: Various classes for testing different SDK operations
   - `packages/sdks/java/tester-local/*.java`: JUnit test classes

2. Python SDK:
   - `packages/sdks/python/tester-local/tests/*.py`: Test scripts for different API functionalities
   - `packages/sdks/python/tester-local/pyproject.toml`: Project configuration

3. TypeScript SDK:
   - `packages/sdks/typescript/tester-local/__tests__/*.test.ts`: Unit tests
   - `packages/sdks/typescript/tester-node/src/*.ts`: Example implementation scripts

## Dependencies

Each SDK has its own set of dependencies:

1. Java SDK:
   - Metriport SDK (generated by Fern)
   - Dotenv for environment variable management
   - SLF4J and Logback for logging
   - JUnit 5 for testing

2. Python SDK:
   - httpx for HTTP requests
   - pydantic for data validation
   - python-dotenv for environment variable management
   - fastapi for API development
   - pytest for testing

3. TypeScript SDK:
   - @metriport/api-sdk for API interactions
   - dotenv for environment variable management
   - Various utilities for HTTP requests and data manipulation
   - Jest for testing (tester-local)
   - ESLint for code quality (tester-node)

## Configuration

All SDKs use environment variables for configuration, typically loaded from a `.env` file. Common configuration options include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| API_KEY / METRIPORT_API_KEY | string | API key for authentication |
| BASE_URL / API_URL | string | Base URL for the Metriport API |
| PATIENT_ID | string | ID of a test patient |
| FACILITY_ID | string | ID of a test facility |

Each SDK also has language-specific configuration files:

- Java: Maven wrapper and build configurations
- Python: `pyproject.toml` for project metadata and dependencies
- TypeScript: `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation, `jest.config.js` for testing, and `.eslintrc.js` for linting

These configurations ensure consistent development environments and testing setups across different programming languages, facilitating easy integration of Metriport's healthcare data services into various applications.
