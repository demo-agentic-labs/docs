## High-level description
The `packages/carequality-sdk` directory contains the implementation of the Carequality SDK, which provides a client for interacting with the Carequality Management API. This SDK facilitates healthcare interoperability by enabling developers to work with standardized healthcare data structures and communicate with the Carequality directory.

## What does it do?
The Carequality SDK allows developers to:

1. Interact with the Carequality Management API to list, register, and update organizations in the Carequality directory.
2. Handle authentication, retries, and different API modes (dev, staging, production) when communicating with the API.
3. Work with standardized healthcare data models, including organizations, addresses, contacts, and FHIR bundles.
4. Validate and ensure type safety for healthcare data structures using Zod schemas.
5. Utilize constants and types related to healthcare interoperability protocols like XCPD and XCA.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers using this SDK is the `index.ts` file in the `src` directory, which exports the key components:

1. `CarequalityManagementAPIImpl`: The implementation class for interacting with the Carequality Management API.
2. `CarequalityManagementAPI`: The interface defining the contract for the API implementation.
3. Various models and types: `Address`, `Contact`, `Organization`, `APIMode`, etc.

The workflow typically involves:
1. Importing the necessary components from the SDK.
2. Instantiating the `CarequalityManagementAPIImpl` with appropriate credentials and configuration.
3. Using the API methods to interact with the Carequality directory.
4. Working with the standardized data models for healthcare information.

## Key Files and Directories

1. `src/client/`:
   - Contains the implementation of the Carequality Management API client.
   - Key files: `carequality-api.ts` (interface) and `carequality.ts` (implementation).

2. `src/common/`:
   - Defines constants and types for healthcare interoperability protocols.
   - Includes definitions for XCPD and XCA transactions.

3. `src/models/`:
   - Contains TypeScript models and Zod schemas for healthcare data structures.
   - Includes schemas for addresses, organizations, contacts, and FHIR bundles.

4. `src/index.ts`:
   - Main export point for the SDK, providing access to key components.

5. `package.json`:
   - Defines the package configuration, including dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

6. `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.ref.json`:
   - TypeScript configuration files for the project, ensuring proper compilation and type checking.

7. `.eslintrc.js`:
   - ESLint configuration file for maintaining code quality and consistency.

## Dependencies
The SDK relies on several external libraries:

1. Axios (^1.6.0): For making HTTP requests to the Carequality API.
2. axios-retry (^3.1.9): Implements retry logic for failed requests.
3. Zod (^3.22.1): For schema definition and validation of healthcare data structures.

## Configuration
The `CarequalityManagementAPIImpl` class accepts configuration options including:

1. Authentication credentials: `orgCert`, `rsaPrivateKey`, `rsaPrivateKeyPassword`, `apiKey`.
2. API mode: `apiMode` (dev, staging, production).
3. Optional parameters: `timeout`, `retries`, `maxBackoff`.

Example configuration:

```typescript
const client = new CarequalityManagementAPIImpl({
  orgCert: '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...',
  rsaPrivateKey: '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...',
  rsaPrivateKeyPassword: 'password123',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  apiMode: 'production',
  options: {
    timeout: 180000,
    retries: 5,
    maxBackoff: 60000
  }
});
```

The package is configured for TypeScript development with strict type checking and linting rules. The `tsconfig.json` file extends the recommended TypeScript configuration and includes additional strict checks to ensure high-quality, type-safe code. The `tsconfig.ref.json` file is specifically designed for reference projects, enabling TypeScript's project references feature.

In summary, the Carequality SDK provides a comprehensive solution for interacting with the Carequality Management API and working with standardized healthcare data structures. It offers a type-safe, well-structured approach to healthcare interoperability, handling complex tasks such as API communication, data validation, and error management.
