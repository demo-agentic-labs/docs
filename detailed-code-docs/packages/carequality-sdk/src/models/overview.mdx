## High-level description
This directory contains TypeScript models and schemas for the Carequality SDK, focusing on healthcare data structures. It uses Zod for schema definition and validation, providing type-safe representations of various healthcare-related entities such as addresses, organizations, contacts, and FHIR bundles.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure and validation rules for various healthcare data objects. It allows developers to:

1. Validate incoming data against predefined schemas
2. Ensure type safety when working with healthcare data structures
3. Create standardized representations of entities like organizations, addresses, and contacts
4. Handle FHIR STU3 bundles, specifically focusing on Organization resources
5. Manage complex nested structures with optional fields and relationships between entities

These models serve as the foundation for data handling and validation within the Carequality SDK, ensuring consistency and reliability when working with healthcare information.

## Key Files

### address.ts
Defines the `addressSchema` for representing physical addresses, including fields for use, type, lines, city, state, postal code, and country. It also incorporates extensions and related organization information.

### bundle.ts
Implements the `stu3BundleSchema` for FHIR STU3 Bundles, focusing on Organization resources. This schema is crucial for handling collections of healthcare data in the FHIR format.

### contact.ts
Provides the `contactSchema` for representing contact information, including purpose, name, telecom details, and address.

### contained.ts
Defines schemas for endpoints and contained data structures, including `endpointExtensionSchema`, `endpointSchema`, and `containedSchema`.

### organization.ts
Implements the `organizationSchema`, representing healthcare organizations with fields for identifiers, name, type, active status, contact information, address, and relationships to other organizations.

### shared.ts
Contains a collection of reusable Zod schemas for common data structures like object values, identifiers, metadata, coding, names, positions, and extensions.

## Dependencies
The primary external dependency for this module is Zod, used for schema definition and validation. Zod provides a powerful and flexible way to define complex data structures with built-in TypeScript type inference.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables used in this directory. The schemas are defined programmatically and can be customized or extended as needed within the application code.

The models in this directory form a crucial part of the Carequality SDK, providing a robust foundation for handling healthcare data. They ensure that data is consistently structured and validated throughout the application, reducing errors and improving reliability in healthcare data exchange and management.
