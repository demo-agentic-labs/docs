## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for an Address object in TypeScript. It's part of a larger SDK for Carequality, likely used for healthcare data exchange. The schema includes various address-related fields and nested structures for managing organization and endpoint information.

## Code Structure
The code primarily defines the `addressSchema` using Zod, which is then exported along with the `Address` type. The schema incorporates various other schemas from the `shared` module, creating a comprehensive structure for address data.

## Symbols

### `addressSchema`
#### Description
Defines a Zod schema for an Address object, including various optional fields and nested structures.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a schema definition, not a function)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| addressSchema | z.ZodObject | Zod schema for Address |

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes fields for:
- Basic address information (use, type, line, city, state, postalCode, country)
- Extensions
- Managing organization
- Contained endpoints (with detailed endpoint information)

Many fields are optional or nullable, allowing for flexible address representations.

### `Address`
#### Description
TypeScript type inferred from the `addressSchema`.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a type definition)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Address | Type | TypeScript type for Address |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Schema definition and validation |

## References
The code references several schemas from the `shared` module:
- `codingSchema`
- `extensionSchema`
- `identifierSchema`
- `objectStringValueOptional`
- `objectValue`
- `objectValueOptional`

These are likely defined in a separate file to promote code reuse across the SDK.
