## High-level description
This code defines the structure and validation for an Organization model using Zod schema validation. It includes schemas for organization identifiers, managing organizations, and the main organization structure. The code is part of a larger system dealing with healthcare organizations, likely in the context of the Carequality framework.

## Code Structure
The main schema defined is `organizationSchema`, which includes various fields such as identifier, name, type, active status, contact information, address, managing organization, and contained data. It uses several sub-schemas like `addressSchema`, `contactSchema`, and `containedSchema`, which are imported from other files.

## Symbols

### `organizationIdentifierSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure for an organization's identifier.

#### Internal Logic
Uses Zod to define an object with optional `use` and `type` fields, and required `system` and `value` fields.

### `managingOrganizationSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure for a managing organization reference.

#### Internal Logic
Uses Zod to define an object with an optional `reference` field containing a nullable string value.

### `partOfSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure for the "part of" relationship of an organization.

#### Internal Logic
Uses Zod to define an object with an `identifier` field using the `organizationIdentifierSchema`.

### `organizationSchema`
#### Description
Defines the main structure for an organization.

#### Internal Logic
Uses Zod to define an object with various fields including identifier, meta, name, type, active status, contact information, address, managing organization, part of relationship, and contained data. It uses several sub-schemas and includes some preprocessing for the address field.

## Types
The code exports several types inferred from the Zod schemas:
- `ManagingOrganization`
- `PartOf`
- `Organization`

These types can be used for type checking and inference in TypeScript code that works with organization data.

## Dependencies
The code imports from the following modules:
- `zod`: Used for schema definition and validation
- `./address`: Imports the `addressSchema`
- `./contact`: Imports the `contactSchema`
- `./contained`: Imports the `containedSchema`
- `./shared`: Imports various utility schemas and types

This code is part of a larger system dealing with healthcare organizations, likely in the context of the Carequality framework. It provides a structured way to define, validate, and work with organization data in a TypeScript environment.
