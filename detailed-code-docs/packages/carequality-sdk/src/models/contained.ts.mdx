## High-level description
This code defines Zod schemas for validating and parsing endpoint and contained data structures in the Carequality SDK. It focuses on defining the structure of endpoints, their extensions, and the contained array that may include these endpoints.

## Code Structure
The code defines several interconnected schemas:
1. `endpointExtensionSchema`: Defines the structure of endpoint extensions.
2. `endpointSchema`: Defines the structure of an endpoint, which includes the extension.
3. `containedSchema`: Defines an array of optional endpoint objects.

These schemas are used to create TypeScript types using Zod's inference.

## Symbols

### `endpointExtensionSchema`
#### Description
Defines the schema for endpoint extensions, which are arrays of objects containing URL and value information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL of the extension |
| valueCodeableConcept | object (optional) | Contains coding information |
| valueString | string (optional) | A string value for the extension |

### `endpointSchema`
#### Description
Defines the schema for an endpoint, including its name, address, connection type, and extension.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | object | The name of the endpoint |
| address | object (optional) | The address of the endpoint |
| connectionType | object | The connection type information |
| extension | object | The extension information for the endpoint |

### `containedSchema`
#### Description
Defines an optional array of objects that may contain endpoints.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Endpoint | object (optional) | An endpoint object conforming to the endpointSchema |

## Types
The code defines two exported types using Zod's inference:

1. `Endpoint`: Inferred from `endpointSchema`
2. `Contained`: Inferred from `containedSchema`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for schema definition and validation |

The code also imports `objectValue` and `objectValueOptional` from a local `shared` module, which are likely reusable Zod schemas for common object structures.

## Notes
This code is part of a larger SDK for Carequality, focusing on data validation and typing. It provides a structured way to work with endpoint and contained data, ensuring type safety and validation in TypeScript projects using this SDK.
