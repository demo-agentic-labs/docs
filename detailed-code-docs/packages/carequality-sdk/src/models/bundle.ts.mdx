## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for a FHIR STU3 Bundle and its corresponding TypeScript type. It's used to validate and type-check the structure of FHIR STU3 Bundle objects, specifically focusing on Organization resources within the bundle.

## Symbols

### `stu3BundleSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure of a FHIR STU3 Bundle. It includes a total count and an array of entries, each potentially containing an Organization resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This is a schema definition, not a function |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | Zod Schema | A Zod schema for validating STU3 Bundle objects |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a `total` field using the `objectNumericValue` schema
- Defines an `entry` field as an array of objects, each containing a `resource` object
- The `resource` object may optionally contain an `Organization` field validated by the `organizationSchema`

### `STU3Bundle`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `stu3BundleSchema`, representing the structure of a FHIR STU3 Bundle.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for schema definition and validation |
| ./organization | Imports the `organizationSchema` for Organization resource validation |
| ./shared | Imports the `objectNumericValue` schema for the `total` field |

## References
This code is referenced in:
- `packages/carequality-sdk/src/client/carequality.ts`: The `STU3Bundle` type and `stu3BundleSchema` are used in the `listOrganizations` method of the `CarequalityManagementAPIImpl` class.

## Notes
- The schema allows for flexible bundle structures, as the Organization resource is optional within each entry.
- This schema focuses specifically on Organization resources, ignoring other potential resource types that might be present in a FHIR bundle.
- The `objectNumericValue` schema (imported from `./shared`) is used for the `total` field, suggesting that it might handle various numeric representations (e.g., string numbers, actual numbers).
