## Notes
This file acts as the main entry point for the Carequality SDK, exporting essential types and classes needed to interact with the Carequality Management API. It brings together various models and implementations from different parts of the SDK, making them easily accessible to consumers of the package.

The exported symbols cover a range of functionalities, from API interaction (CarequalityManagementAPIImpl and CarequalityManagementAPI) to data models (Address, Contact, Organization). This structure allows users of the SDK to import only the specific components they need for their use case.

The inclusion of the PurposeOfUse enumeration from a shared package suggests that this concept is used across multiple parts of the larger system, not just within the Carequality SDK.
