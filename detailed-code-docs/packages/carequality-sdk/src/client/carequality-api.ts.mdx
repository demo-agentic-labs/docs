## References
This interface is implemented in the `CarequalityManagementAPIImpl` class in the `carequality.ts` file. The implementation provides the actual logic for interacting with the Carequality API.

## Notes
- The interface uses Promises for asynchronous operations, which is a common pattern for API interactions in TypeScript/JavaScript.
- The `Organization` type is imported from a separate model file, indicating a separation of concerns between the API interface and data models.
- The interface methods correspond to specific Carequality API endpoints and operations, providing a typed and structured way to interact with the API.
