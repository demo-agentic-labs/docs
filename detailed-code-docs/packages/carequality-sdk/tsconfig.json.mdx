title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for the carequality-sdk package. It defines compiler options and settings for TypeScript compilation, extending from a recommended configuration and including additional strict checks to ensure high-quality, type-safe code.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with three main sections: "extends", "compilerOptions", and file inclusion/exclusion settings.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object specifies various TypeScript compiler options to control the compilation process and output.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set to:
1. Target ECMAScript 2020 (`"target": "es2020"`)
2. Generate source maps (`"sourceMap": true`)
3. Generate declaration files (`"declaration": true`, `"declarationMap": true`)
4. Enable decorator metadata and experimental decorators (`"emitDecoratorMetadata": true`, `"experimentalDecorators": true`)
5. Include several strict checking options from @tsconfig/strictest
6. Set the output directory to "./dist" (`"outDir": "./dist"`)

### include
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Includes all files in the "./src" directory.

### exclude
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Excludes the "dist" and "node_modules" directories.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tsconfig/recommended | Provides a base recommended TypeScript configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "@tsconfig/recommended/tsconfig.json" | Extends the recommended TypeScript configuration |
| compilerOptions | object | (various) | Specifies compiler options for TypeScript |
| include | array | ["./src"] | Specifies files to include in compilation |
| exclude | array | ["dist", "node_modules"] | Specifies files to exclude from compilation |

## Performance Considerations
The strict checking options enabled in this configuration may slightly increase compilation time but significantly improve code quality and reduce runtime errors.
