## High-level description
This code defines a class `AppointmentNotification2` that listens for appointment creation events and sends notifications to an external API (Metriport). It processes patient data and appointment information, then sends this data to create or update a patient record and initiate a document query.

## Code Structure
The main class `AppointmentNotification2` inherits from `ClinicalQualityMeasure`. It contains a single method `compute_results` that handles the core functionality of processing appointment creation events and sending notifications.

### AppointmentNotification2
#### Description
A class that extends `ClinicalQualityMeasure` to handle appointment creation notifications. It listens for appointment creation events and sends patient data to an external API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the changed model is an appointment and if it was created.
2. Retrieves the appointment data using FHIR.
3. Prepares patient data payload.
4. Sends patient data to Metriport API.
5. If successful, initiates a document query with additional metadata.

### compute_results
#### Description
The main method that processes appointment creation events and sends notifications.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't have explicit inputs but uses class attributes and settings.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | ProtocolResult | Contains the status and narrative of the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes a `ProtocolResult` object.
2. Checks if the changed model is an appointment and if it was created.
3. Retrieves appointment data using FHIR.
4. Prepares patient data payload from the patient object.
5. Sends patient data to Metriport API using `send_notification`.
6. If successful, retrieves the patient ID from the response.
7. Sends a document query request with additional metadata.
8. Adds narratives to the result object for logging purposes.

## Side Effects
- Sends HTTP requests to external APIs (Metriport).
- Modifies the `result` object by adding narratives.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| canvas_workflow_kit | Provides core functionality for the protocol |
| json | Used for JSON manipulation |
| FumageHelper | Helps with FHIR operations |

## Configuration
The code uses several configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| METRIPORT_API_KEY | string | None | API key for Metriport |
| METRIPORT_FACILITY_ID | string | None | Facility ID for Metriport |
| CANVAS_PROVIDER_NAME | string | None | Provider name for Canvas |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling:
- Raises an exception if the FHIR Appointment search fails.
- Adds an error narrative if unable to retrieve the patient ID from the API response.

## Logging
The code uses the `add_narrative` method of `ProtocolResult` to log information about the API responses.

## TODOs
- The code includes a comment to manually change the `base_url` before uploading the protocol to the production account.
