title: "tsconfig.ref.json"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.ref.json`) extends the base configuration and sets up specific compiler options for the `api-sdk` package. It's designed to be used as a reference in a project with multiple packages, enabling TypeScript's project references feature.

## Code Structure
The configuration file extends the base `tsconfig.json` and adds specific settings for the `api-sdk` package.

## References
This file is referenced by the root `tsconfig.json` file in the project's main directory.

### Configuration Object
#### Description
The main configuration object that specifies TypeScript compiler options and file inclusion for the `api-sdk` package.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends the base `tsconfig.json` configuration.
2. Specifies files to include in the compilation.
3. Sets compiler options specific to this package.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./tsconfig.json | Base TypeScript configuration that this file extends |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | string | "./tsconfig.json" | Specifies the base configuration file to extend |
| include | array | ["src/**/*"] | Defines which files to include in the compilation |
| compilerOptions.composite | boolean | true | Enables TypeScript's project references feature |

## Performance Considerations
The use of the `composite` option in the compiler options enables TypeScript's project references feature. This can significantly improve build times in large projects by allowing incremental compilation and better editor support for multi-package projects.
