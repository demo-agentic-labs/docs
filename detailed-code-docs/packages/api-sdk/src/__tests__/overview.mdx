## High-level description
This code sets up the environment for testing the api-sdk package by loading environment variables from a .env file. It uses the dotenv library to configure the environment and determines the correct path for the .env file based on the current working directory.

## Symbols

### `dotenv.config()`
#### Description
Configures the environment by loading variables from a .env file using the dotenv library.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | object | An object with a `path` property specifying the location of the .env file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the current working directory using `process.cwd()`.
2. Constructs the path to the .env file based on whether the current directory includes "packages" or not.
3. Uses `path.resolve()` to create an absolute path to the .env file.
4. Calls `dotenv.config()` with the constructed path to load the environment variables.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | Used to load environment variables from a .env file |
| path | Used for resolving and manipulating file paths |

## Notes
- The code includes a comment emphasizing that the dotenv import and configuration should be kept before everything else in the file. This is important to ensure that environment variables are loaded before any other code that might depend on them is executed.
- The path resolution logic accommodates different project structures, allowing the code to work correctly whether it's run from the root of the project or within the packages/api-sdk directory.
