## High-level description
The `packages/api-sdk/src/medical` directory contains the core implementation of the Metriport Medical API SDK. It provides a comprehensive set of models, schemas, and client functionality for interacting with Metriport's Medical API. The directory is structured into two main parts: the client implementation and the models definition.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a robust SDK for interacting with Metriport's Medical API, enabling developers to:

1. Manage account settings and webhooks
2. Create, update, and retrieve organizations and facilities
3. Manage patients, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
4. Query and retrieve patient documents
5. Handle consolidated patient data queries
6. Manage document references and uploads
7. Verify webhook signatures and parse webhook responses

The SDK provides a type-safe and validated approach to handling medical data, implementing FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data models and query structures. It ensures data integrity and consistency throughout API interactions.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this SDK is the `MetriportMedicalApi` class defined in the `client/metriport.ts` file. Developers should start by instantiating this class with their API key and any additional options. The class provides methods for all supported API operations.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. A method of `MetriportMedicalApi` is called with necessary parameters.
2. The method formats the request, including authentication headers.
3. The request is sent to the appropriate Metriport API endpoint using axios.
4. The response is parsed and returned to the caller.

The control flow is primarily driven by the methods of the `MetriportMedicalApi` class, each corresponding to a specific API operation.

## Key Files
1. `client/metriport.ts`: Contains the `MetriportMedicalApi` class, the main client for interacting with the Metriport Medical API.

2. `models/patient.ts`: Defines schemas and types for patient-related operations.

3. `models/organization.ts`: Implements organization-related data models and schemas.

4. `models/facility.ts`: Contains schemas for creating and managing facilities.

5. `models/demographics.ts`: Defines the structure and validation rules for patient demographics data.

6. `models/fhir.ts`: Contains definitions for FHIR resource types and query-related structures.

7. `models/common/`: Includes common models and schemas used across the API, such as address validation and US state data.

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies used in this directory are:

1. Zod: Used extensively for schema definition and validation.
2. @metriport/shared: Provides utility functions and common definitions.
3. @medplum/fhirtypes: Used for FHIR-related type definitions.
4. @metriport/commonwell-sdk: Utilized for interactions with the CommonWell Health Alliance network.
5. axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the Metriport API.
6. crypto: Used for cryptographic operations, particularly in webhook signature verification.
7. http-status: Provides HTTP status code constants.
8. dayjs: Used in tests for date manipulation.
9. uuid: Used in tests for generating random UUIDs.

These dependencies were chosen for their robustness in type checking, data validation, and API interactions, as well as to maintain consistency across different parts of the Metriport ecosystem.

## Configuration
The `MetriportMedicalApi` class can be configured with the following options:
- `apiKey`: The API key for authentication (required)
- `baseURL`: The base URL for the Metriport API (optional, defaults to the production URL)
- `timeout`: The timeout for API requests in milliseconds (optional)
- `maxBodyLength`: The maximum allowed body length for API requests (optional)

Example configuration:

```typescript
const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("your-api-key", {
  baseURL: "https://api.metriport.com",
  timeout: 5000,
  maxBodyLength: 10000000
});
```

Some configurable options are embedded within the schemas:

1. In `models/common/address.ts`:
   - `zipLength`: Set to 5, defining the expected length of ZIP codes.
   - `country`: Defaults to "USA" in the address schema.

2. In `models/common/us-data.ts`:
   - The `usStateSchema` is configured to preprocess string inputs by converting them to uppercase, allowing for case-insensitive state abbreviation inputs.

This directory provides a robust and well-tested SDK for interacting with Metriport's Medical API, offering a wide range of functionality for managing medical data and integrating with Health Information Exchanges (HIEs).
