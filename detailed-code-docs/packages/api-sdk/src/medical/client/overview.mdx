## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the `MetriportMedicalApi` class, which serves as the main client for interacting with Metriport's Medical API. It provides a comprehensive set of methods for various operations such as managing organizations, facilities, patients, documents, and consolidated data queries. The directory also includes end-to-end tests for the `listDocuments` method.

## What does it do?
The `MetriportMedicalApi` class acts as a bridge between client applications and Metriport's Medical API. It handles authentication, request formatting, and response parsing for various API endpoints. The class provides methods for:

1. Managing account settings and webhooks
2. Creating, updating, and retrieving organizations and facilities
3. Managing patients, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
4. Querying and retrieving patient documents
5. Handling consolidated patient data queries
6. Managing document references and uploads
7. Verifying webhook signatures and parsing webhook responses

The test file ensures that the `listDocuments` method works correctly under various scenarios, including filtering by date range and content, and verifies the structure and content of the returned documents.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `metriport.ts` file, which contains the `MetriportMedicalApi` class. This class is the primary interface for interacting with the Metriport Medical API. Developers should start by instantiating this class with their API key and any additional options.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. A method of `MetriportMedicalApi` is called with necessary parameters.
2. The method formats the request, including authentication headers.
3. The request is sent to the appropriate Metriport API endpoint using axios.
4. The response is parsed and returned to the caller.

The control flow is primarily driven by the methods of the `MetriportMedicalApi` class, each corresponding to a specific API operation.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:
- @medplum/fhirtypes: Provides FHIR type definitions
- @metriport/shared/medical: Contains shared utilities and types for medical data
- axios: Used for making HTTP requests
- crypto: Used for cryptographic operations, particularly in webhook signature verification
- http-status: Provides HTTP status code constants
- zod: Used for schema validation
- dayjs: Used in tests for date manipulation
- uuid: Used in tests for generating random UUIDs

## Configuration
The `MetriportMedicalApi` class can be configured with the following options:
- `apiKey`: The API key for authentication (required)
- `baseURL`: The base URL for the Metriport API (optional, defaults to the production URL)
- `timeout`: The timeout for API requests in milliseconds (optional)
- `maxBodyLength`: The maximum allowed body length for API requests (optional)

Example configuration:

```typescript
const metriport = new MetriportMedicalApi("your-api-key", {
  baseURL: "https://api.metriport.com",
  timeout: 5000,
  maxBodyLength: 10000000
});
```

The test file uses environment variables for configuration, particularly `TEST_PATIENT_ID` for specifying the patient ID to use in tests.

This directory provides a robust and well-tested client for interacting with Metriport's Medical API, offering a wide range of functionality for managing medical data and integrating with Health Information Exchanges (HIEs).
