## High-level description
This file contains end-to-end tests for the `listDocuments` method of the `MetriportMedicalApi` class. It tests various scenarios of document listing, including filtering by date range and content, as well as verifying the structure and content of the returned documents.

## Code Structure
The tests are organized within a `describe` block for the `listDocuments` method. Each test case is defined using Jest's `it` function, focusing on different aspects of the `listDocuments` functionality.

## Symbols

### `describe("listDocuments", ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `listDocuments` method. It contains multiple test cases that verify different aspects of the method's functionality.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks for the presence of a `TEST_PATIENT_ID` environment variable.
- If the variable is missing, it skips all tests and logs a message.
- Otherwise, it proceeds with running the individual test cases.

### `it("returns documents when no filters", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the basic functionality of `listDocuments` without any filters.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `metriport.listDocuments(patientId)` without any filters.
- Expects the returned documents to be truthy and have a length greater than or equal to 1.

### `it("returns no documents when dateFrom is future", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that no documents are returned when the `dateFrom` filter is set to a future date.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `dateFrom` to 3 days in the future.
- Expects the returned documents array to be empty.

### `it("returns no documents when dateTo is ancient", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that no documents are returned when the `dateTo` filter is set to a very old date.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `dateTo` to 100 years in the past.
- Expects the returned documents array to be empty.

### `it("returns documents when dateFrom is past", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that documents are returned when the `dateFrom` filter is set to a past date.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `dateFrom` to 10 years in the past.
- Expects the returned documents to be truthy and have a length greater than or equal to 1.

### `it("converts dateFrom Date to ISO string", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that the `dateFrom` filter works correctly when provided as a Date object.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `dateFrom` to a Date object 10 years in the past.
- Expects the returned documents to be truthy and have a length greater than or equal to 1.

### `it("returns documents when dateTo is today", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that documents are returned when the `dateTo` filter is set to today's date.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `dateTo` to today's date.
- Expects the returned documents to be truthy and have a length greater than or equal to 1.

### `it("converts dateFrom Date to ISO string", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that the `dateTo` filter works correctly when provided as a Date object.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `dateTo` to a new Date() object.
- Expects the returned documents to be truthy and have a length greater than or equal to 1.

### `it("returns documents filtering by content", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that documents are returned when filtering by content.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `content` filter to "org".
- Expects the returned documents to be truthy and have a length greater than or equal to 1.

### `it("does not return documents filtering by unknown content", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that no documents are returned when filtering by unknown content.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `content` filter to a random UUID.
- Expects the returned documents array to be empty.

### `it("fails if content filter is less than 3 chars", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that the method throws an error if the content filter is less than 3 characters long.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `content` filter to "jo".
- Expects the method call to throw an error.

### `it("returns documents when all filters are combined", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that documents are returned when all filters (dateFrom, dateTo, and content) are combined.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `dateFrom` to 10 years in the past, `dateTo` to 1 day in the future, and `content` to "org".
- Expects the returned documents to be truthy and have a length greater than or equal to 1.

### `it("returns document in FHIR format", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that the returned documents are in the correct FHIR format.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets filters similar to the previous test.
- Checks that the first returned document has the correct FHIR structure and required fields.

### `it("only returns doc refs from Metriport and HIEs", ...)`
#### Description
Tests that the returned documents are only from Metriport and specified HIEs (COMMONWELL and CAREQUALITY).

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves documents without filters.
- Checks that all documents have extensions with codes matching the expected sources.

### `it("returns documents as DTO", ...)`
#### Description
Tests the `listDocumentsAsDTO` method, which returns documents in a DTO format.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `metriport.listDocumentsAsDTO(patientId)`.
- Checks that the returned documents have the expected DTO structure and fields.

## Dependencies
- dayjs: Used for date manipulation and formatting.
- uuid: Used to generate random UUIDs for testing.
- @metriport/shared: Provides utility functions and constants.
- MetriportMedicalApi: The main class being tested.

## TODOs
- There is a TODO comment suggesting that a beforeAll()/afterAll() setup should be implemented to make the test results more deterministic.
