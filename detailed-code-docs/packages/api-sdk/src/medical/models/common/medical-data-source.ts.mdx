## High-level description
This code defines an enumeration `MedicalDataSource` in TypeScript, which represents different sources of medical data. It currently includes two sources: COMMONWELL and CAREQUALITY.

## Symbols

### `MedicalDataSource`
#### Description
`MedicalDataSource` is an enumeration that defines constants for different medical data sources. It provides a standardized way to refer to specific data sources throughout the application.

#### Enumeration Values
| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| COMMONWELL | "COMMONWELL" | Represents the CommonWell Health Alliance data source |
| CAREQUALITY | "CAREQUALITY" | Represents the Carequality data source |

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a standalone TypeScript enumeration definition.

## References
The `MedicalDataSource` enum is referenced in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/core/src/external/carequality/extension.ts`, it's used to set the `code` value for the Carequality extension.
2. In `packages/api/src/external/carequality/command/run-or-schedule-patient-discovery.ts`, it's used to specify the data source when scheduling patient discovery.
3. In `packages/api/src/domain/medical/docref-mapping.ts`, it's used as the type for the `source` field in the `DocRefMappingCreate` interface.
4. In `packages/api-sdk/src/index.ts`, it's exported as part of the public API of the SDK.

These references indicate that the `MedicalDataSource` enum is an important part of the system's data model, used to distinguish between different sources of medical data throughout the application.

## Usage
The `MedicalDataSource` enum is likely used in various parts of the application where it's necessary to specify or differentiate between different sources of medical data. This could include scenarios such as:

1. Tagging data with its source
2. Filtering or querying data based on its source
3. Implementing source-specific logic or integrations

By using an enum, the code ensures type safety and prevents the use of invalid data source values.
