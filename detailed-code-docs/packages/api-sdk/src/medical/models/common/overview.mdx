## High-level description
This directory contains common models and schemas used in the medical API SDK. It includes definitions for addresses, base update operations, medical data sources, and US state data. These models serve as foundational structures for various parts of the medical API, ensuring consistency and type safety across the application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides essential data structures and validation schemas for common elements used in medical data management:

1. It defines a comprehensive address structure with validation rules for various components like address lines, city, state, zip code, and geographical coordinates.
2. It establishes a base schema for update operations, including entity ID and ETag for optimistic concurrency control.
3. It enumerates different medical data sources, currently including COMMONWELL and CAREQUALITY.
4. It provides a schema for validating US state inputs, ensuring only valid state abbreviations are accepted.

These structures and schemas are used throughout the medical API to standardize data formats, validate inputs, and maintain consistency in data handling across different parts of the application.

## Key Files

1. `address.ts`: Defines the `addressSchema` using Zod, which includes validation for address components and geographical coordinates. It also exports an `Address` type derived from this schema.

2. `base-update.ts`: Contains the `baseUpdateSchema` for update operations, including an ID and optional ETag. It also provides a utility function `getETagHeader` for generating ETag headers in HTTP requests.

3. `medical-data-source.ts`: Defines the `MedicalDataSource` enum, which currently includes COMMONWELL and CAREQUALITY as sources of medical data.

4. `us-data.ts`: Exports a `USState` object and a `usStateSchema` for validating US state inputs, ensuring case-insensitive matching against valid state abbreviations.

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies used in this directory are:

1. Zod (version not specified): Used for schema definition and validation across multiple files. Zod provides a type-safe and declarative way to define and validate data structures.

2. @metriport/shared (version not specified): A shared package that provides utility functions and common definitions. It's used for functions like `stripNonNumericChars` and shared definitions like `USState`.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their robustness in type checking and data validation, as well as to maintain consistency across different parts of the Metriport ecosystem.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, some configurable options are embedded within the schemas:

1. In `address.ts`:
   - `zipLength`: Set to 5, defining the expected length of ZIP codes.
   - `country`: Defaults to "USA" in the address schema.

2. In `us-data.ts`:
   - The `usStateSchema` is configured to preprocess string inputs by converting them to uppercase, allowing for case-insensitive state abbreviation inputs.

These configuration options are hardcoded into the schemas but could potentially be externalized into configuration files if more flexibility is needed in the future.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `addressSchema` from `address.ts` might be used:

```typescript
import { addressSchema, Address } from './address';

const validAddress: Address = {
  addressLine1: '123 Main St',
  city: 'Anytown',
  state: 'CA',
  zip: '12345',
  country: 'USA',
};

const result = addressSchema.safeParse(validAddress);
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Valid address:', result.data);
} else {
  console.error('Invalid address:', result.error);
}
```

And here's an example of using the `getETagHeader` function from `base-update.ts`:

```typescript
import { getETagHeader } from './base-update';

const entity = { id: '123', eTag: 'abc123' };
const headers = getETagHeader(entity);

if (headers) {
  console.log('ETag header:', headers['If-Match']);
} else {
  console.log('No ETag header generated');
}
```

These examples demonstrate how the schemas and utilities in this directory can be used to validate data and generate headers for API requests, ensuring consistency and proper handling of medical data across the application.
