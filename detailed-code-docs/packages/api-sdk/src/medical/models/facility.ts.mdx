## High-level description
This code defines the schema for creating and managing facilities in a medical API. It includes data validation using Zod, and defines the structure for facility creation, update, and listing operations.

## Code Structure
The main schema `facilityCreateSchema` defines the structure for creating a facility. The `facilitySchema` extends this by merging it with a base update schema. These schemas are used to create TypeScript types `FacilityCreate` and `Facility`. The `facilityListSchema` is used for listing facilities.

## Symbols

### `facilityCreateSchema`
#### Description
Defines the schema for creating a new facility.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Zod to define a schema with the following fields:
  - `name`: A non-empty string
  - `npi`: A 10-character string that must be a valid NPI (National Provider Identifier)
  - `tin`: An optional, nullable string
  - `active`: An optional, nullable boolean
  - `address`: Uses the `addressSchema` imported from "./common/address"

### `FacilityCreate`
#### Description
TypeScript type inferred from `facilityCreateSchema`.

### `facilitySchema`
#### Description
Extends `facilityCreateSchema` by merging it with `baseUpdateSchema`.

### `Facility`
#### Description
TypeScript type inferred from `facilitySchema`.

### `facilityListSchema`
#### Description
Defines a schema for a list of facilities.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Zod to define an object with a `facilities` property, which is an array of `facilitySchema` objects.

## Dependencies
- `z` from "zod": Used for schema definition and validation
- `addressSchema` from "./common/address": Used for the `address` field in `facilityCreateSchema`
- `baseUpdateSchema` from "./common/base-update": Used to extend `facilityCreateSchema` into `facilitySchema`
- `validateNPI` from "@metriport/shared": Used to validate the NPI field

## Error Handling
The `npi` field uses a custom refinement to validate the NPI using the `validateNPI` function. If the NPI is invalid, it will raise a validation error with the message "NPI is not valid".

This code provides a robust structure for managing facility data in a medical API context, ensuring data integrity through schema validation.
