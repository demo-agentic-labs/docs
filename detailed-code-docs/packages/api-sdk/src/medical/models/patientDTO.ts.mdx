## High-level description
This file defines the structure of a PatientDTO (Data Transfer Object) in TypeScript. It includes various properties that represent patient information such as personal details, identifiers, address, and contact information. The file also defines several types and interfaces related to patient data.

## Code Structure
The file imports types and schemas from other modules and defines the PatientDTO type along with several supporting types. These types are used to structure patient data in a consistent format for data transfer between different parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `PatientDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a patient data transfer object.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the shape of an object that represents a patient.

#### Outputs
An object conforming to the PatientDTO type.

#### Internal Logic
The PatientDTO type includes the following fields:
- `id`: string (required)
- `eTag`: string (optional)
- `firstName`: string (required)
- `lastName`: string (required)
- `dob`: string (required)
- `genderAtBirth`: "M" or "F" (required)
- `personalIdentifiers`: array of PersonalIdentifier (optional)
- `facilityIds`: array of strings (required)
- `externalId`: string (optional)
- `dateCreated`: Date (optional)
- `address`: Address or array of Address (required)
- `contact`: Contact or array of Contact (optional)

### `Coordinates`
#### Description
Defines the structure for geographical coordinates.

#### Internal Logic

### `BaseIdentifier`
#### Description
Defines the base structure for an identifier.

#### Internal Logic
Includes `value` (required), `period` (optional), and `assigner` (optional) properties.

#### Description
Extends BaseIdentifier with additional type information.

#### Internal Logic
Combines BaseIdentifier with either a general personal identifier type or a driver's license identifier type (which includes a state).

#### Internal Logic
Includes optional `phone` and `email` properties.
