### `MedicalRecordsStatusDTO`
#### Description
`MedicalRecordsStatusDTO` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure for representing the status of medical records. It contains optional fields for the creation timestamps of HTML and PDF versions of the medical records.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the shape of objects that conform to this type.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| htmlCreatedAt | string (optional) | Timestamp indicating when the HTML version of the medical record was created |
| pdfCreatedAt | string (optional) | Timestamp indicating when the PDF version of the medical record was created |

#### Outputs
As a type definition, it doesn't produce outputs directly. It is used to type-check objects that should conform to this structure.

## References
The `MedicalRecordsStatusDTO` type is exported from this module and is referenced in the main index file of the API SDK (`packages/api-sdk/src/index.ts`). This suggests that it's part of the public API of the SDK and can be imported and used by consumers of the package.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in type system.

## Notes
1. Both fields in the `MedicalRecordsStatusDTO` type are optional (denoted by the `?` after the field name). This means that objects of this type may or may not include these properties.

2. The timestamps are represented as strings rather than Date objects. This is a common practice when working with APIs, as it allows for more flexible representation of dates and times (e.g., ISO 8601 format) and avoids issues with date parsing across different systems.

3. The naming convention (DTO suffix) suggests that this type is used for Data Transfer Objects, typically used to define the structure of data sent between different parts of an application or between the client and server.

4. The file is part of a larger SDK structure, specifically within the "medical" domain of the API, as indicated by its location in the file system (`packages/api-sdk/src/medical/models/`).

5. This type definition is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the SDK to handle medical record data, possibly for tracking the status of document generation or retrieval processes.
