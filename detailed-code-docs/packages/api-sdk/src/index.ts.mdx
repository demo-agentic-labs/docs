## High-level description
This file (packages/api-sdk/src/index.ts) serves as the main entry point for the Metriport API SDK. It exports various types, interfaces, and classes related to both the Devices API and the Medical API, making them available for use by consumers of the SDK.

## Code Structure
The file is organized into two main sections: Devices API exports and Medical API exports. Each section exports relevant types, interfaces, and classes from their respective modules.

## Symbols

### Devices API Exports
#### Description
Exports various types and classes related to the Devices API, including the main client class and data models.

#### Exports
- `MetriportDevicesApi`: The main client class for interacting with the Devices API.
- Various data models: `Activity`, `Biometrics`, `Body`, `ConnectedUserInfo`, `Food`, `ProviderSource`, `SourceType`, `Nutrition`, `Sleep`, `User`.

### Medical API Exports
#### Description
Exports types, interfaces, and classes related to the Medical API, including the main client class, data models, and utility functions.

#### Exports
- `MetriportMedicalApi`: The main client class for interacting with the Medical API.
- Various data models and schemas: `Address`, `BaseUpdate`, `MedicalDataSource`, `USState`, `Demographics`, `DocumentQuery`, `Facility`, `Organization`, `Patient`, `PatientDTO`.
- Webhook-related types: `WebhookRequestParsingFailure`, `WebhookRequest`, `WebhookRequestStatus`, `WebhookType`.
- FHIR-related exports: All exports from "./medical/models/fhir".

## Dependencies
The file imports from various internal modules within the @metriport/shared package and local files within the SDK.

## Notes
- The file uses ES6 module syntax for imports and exports.
- It re-exports many types and interfaces, making them easily accessible to users of the SDK.
- The exports are organized logically, separating Devices API and Medical API related items.
- Some exports include both the main type/interface and its corresponding Zod schema (e.g., `Address` and `addressSchema`).

This index file serves as a centralized point for accessing the various components of the Metriport API SDK, making it easier for developers to import and use the necessary types and classes in their applications.
