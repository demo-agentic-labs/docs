## High-level description
This code defines an interface `WebhookStatusResponse` that represents the status of a webhook in the Metriport Devices API. It includes information about whether the webhook is enabled, its status details, and the number of requests being processed or that have failed.

### `WebhookStatusResponse`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure for the response containing webhook status information.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhookEnabled | boolean | Indicates whether the webhook is enabled or not |
| webhookStatusDetail | string (optional) | Provides additional details about the webhook status |
| webhookRequestsProcessing | number | The number of webhook requests currently being processed |
| webhookRequestsFailed | number | The number of webhook requests that have failed |

## References
This interface is used in the `MetriportDevicesApi` class in the `metriport.ts` file, specifically in the `getWebhookStatus` method:

```typescript
async getWebhookStatus(): Promise&lt;WebhookStatusResponse&gt; {
  const resp = await this.api.get&lt;WebhookStatusResponse&gt;("/settings/webhook");
  return resp.data;
}
```

This method retrieves the webhook status from the API and returns it as a `WebhookStatusResponse` object.

## Dependencies
This interface doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript interface definition.

## Notes
1. The `webhookStatusDetail` property is optional, indicated by the `?` after its name. This means it may or may not be present in the response.
2. This interface is part of a larger API SDK for interacting with the Metriport Devices API, which includes various methods for managing users, retrieving health data, and handling webhook-related operations.
3. The interface is designed to provide a clear structure for webhook status information, making it easier for developers to work with the API response in a type-safe manner.
