### `SettingsResponse`
#### Description
`SettingsResponse` is an interface that defines the structure of the response object returned when querying or updating account settings in the Metriport Devices API.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | A unique identifier for the settings |
| webhookUrl | string \| null \| undefined | The URL where webhooks will be sent (optional) |
| webhookKey | string \| null \| undefined | A key used for webhook authentication (optional) |

## References
This interface is used in the `MetriportDevicesApi` class in the related file `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/client/metriport.ts`. Specifically, it's used in the following methods:

1. `getSettings()`: Returns the account settings.
2. `updateSettings(webhookUrl: string)`: Updates the account settings with a new webhook URL.

Both of these methods return a Promise that resolves to a `SettingsResponse` object.

## Dependencies
This interface doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses only built-in TypeScript types.

## Notes
1. The `webhookUrl` and `webhookKey` properties are optional and can be undefined or null. This allows for flexibility in the API response, where these values might not always be present or set.
2. The `id` field is required, suggesting that every settings object will always have an identifier.
3. This interface is likely part of a larger API SDK for interacting with the Metriport Devices API, as evidenced by its use in the `MetriportDevicesApi` class in the related file.
