### `GetMetriportUserIDResponse`
#### Description
This interface defines the structure of the response object returned when requesting a Metriport user ID. It is used to ensure type safety and provide a clear contract for the expected response format.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userId | string | The unique identifier for a Metriport user |

## References
This interface is used in the `MetriportDevicesApi` class, specifically in the `getMetriportUserId` method, as seen in the related code snippet from `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/client/metriport.ts`.

## Usage Context
Based on the related code, this interface is used in the following context:

1. It is imported in the `MetriportDevicesApi` class:
   ```typescript
   import { GetMetriportUserIDResponse } from "./models/get-metriport-user-id-response";
   ```

2. It is used as the type parameter for the axios post request in the `getMetriportUserId` method:
   ```typescript
   async getMetriportUserId(appUserId: string): Promise&lt;string&gt; {
     const resp = await this.api.post&lt;GetMetriportUserIDResponse&gt;("/user", null, {
       params: { appUserId: appUserId },
     });
     return resp.data.userId;
   }
   ```

This usage ensures that the response from the API call is typed correctly, allowing for safe access to the `userId` property of the response data.
