## Related Code Context
The `GetConnectedUsersResponse` interface is used in the `MetriportDevicesApi` class in the `getConnectedUsers` method. This method returns a promise that resolves to an object matching the `GetConnectedUsersResponse` interface. The `ConnectedUserInfo` type, which is used in this interface, contains information about a connected user, including their Metriport user ID, app user ID, and an optional array of connected providers.

This interface plays a crucial role in typing the response of the API call to retrieve connected users, ensuring type safety and providing a clear structure for the returned data.
