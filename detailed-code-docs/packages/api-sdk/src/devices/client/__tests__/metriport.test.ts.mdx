## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `getMetriportUserId` method of the `MetriportDevicesApi` class. It uses Jest as the testing framework and mocks the axios library to simulate API calls.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized within a `describe` block for the `getMetriportUserId` method. It contains a single test case that verifies the correct behavior of the method.

## Symbols

### `describe` block for "getMetriportUserId"
#### Description
This block groups the tests for the `getMetriportUserId` method.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up mock data and instances for testing.
- Contains a single test case.

### `it` block: "returns the userId"
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `getMetriportUserId` method correctly returns the user ID.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange:
   - Creates a new `MetriportDevicesApi` instance.
   - Mocks the axios instance used by the API client.
   - Sets up a spy on the `getMetriportUserId` method.
   - Mocks the axios post method to resolve with a response containing the user ID.

2. Act:
   - Calls the `getMetriportUserId` method with a fake user ID.

3. Assert:
   - Verifies that the axios post method was called once with the correct parameters.
   - Checks that the returned result matches the expected user ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| jest-mock | Used for mocking objects in tests |
| axios | HTTP client library (mocked in this test) |
| @faker-js/faker | Generates fake data for testing |
| ../metriport | Contains the `MetriportDevicesApi` class being tested |

## Error Handling
This test file does not explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the successful case of retrieving a user ID.

## Notes
- The test uses Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate the `getMetriportUserId` method and control the behavior of external dependencies (axios).
- Faker is used to generate random UUIDs for the user ID and API key, ensuring that the test doesn't rely on hardcoded values.
- The test verifies both the correct calling of the underlying API (via axios) and the correct return value of the method.
