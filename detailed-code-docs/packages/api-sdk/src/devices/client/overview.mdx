## High-level description
This directory contains the core components of the Metriport Devices API client. It includes the main API client class, utility functions for date and timezone validation, and TypeScript interface definitions for various API response models. The code is designed to provide a robust and type-safe interface for interacting with the Metriport Devices API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to:
1. Interact with the Metriport Devices API through a well-structured client class.
2. Manage users, retrieve health data (activity, body, biometrics, nutrition, sleep), and handle webhook-related operations.
3. Ensure data integrity by validating date and timezone inputs.
4. Work with strongly-typed API response models, enhancing type safety and developer experience.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers using this SDK is the `MetriportDevicesApi` class defined in `metriport.ts`. This class provides methods for all supported API operations, including user management, data retrieval, and webhook handling.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. An instance of `MetriportDevicesApi` is created with an API key.
2. Methods on this instance are called to interact with the API.
3. These methods use the utility functions in the `util` directory to validate inputs.
4. API responses are parsed into the appropriate model types defined in the `models` directory.

## Key Files
1. `metriport.ts`: Contains the `MetriportDevicesApi` class, the main client for API interactions.
2. `util/date-util.ts` and `util/timezone-util.ts`: Provide utility functions for validating dates and timezones.
3. `models/*.ts`: Define TypeScript interfaces for various API response structures.

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies are:
1. axios (version not specified): Used for making HTTP requests to the Metriport API.
2. dayjs (version not specified): Used for date and timezone operations in the utility functions.

These libraries were likely chosen for their reliability, wide adoption, and feature sets that align well with the needs of the SDK.

## Configuration
The SDK doesn't use explicit configuration files, but it does accept configuration options when initializing the `MetriportDevicesApi` class. Key configurable elements include:
- API key (required)
- Base URL (optional, defaults to a predefined value)
- Axios instance options (optional)

Example initialization:

```typescript
const api = new MetriportDevicesApi("your-api-key", {
  baseURL: "https://custom-api-url.com",
  axiosOptions: { timeout: 5000 }
});
```

The SDK uses a hardcoded date format ("YYYY-MM-DD") for validation. If different date formats need to be supported in the future, this might need to be made configurable.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive client for the Metriport Devices API, offering type-safe interactions, input validation, and a clear structure for making API requests and handling responses. It's designed to be easy to use while ensuring data integrity and providing a robust developer experience.
