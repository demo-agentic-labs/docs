## High-level description
This code defines an interface `HeartRateVariability` that represents heart rate variability data. It includes two optional properties, `rmssd` and `sdnn`, each containing average values and samples of heart rate variability measurements in milliseconds.

## Symbols

### `HeartRateVariability`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure for heart rate variability data. It includes two common measures of heart rate variability: RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) and SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN Intervals).

#### Inputs
This is an interface, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the structure of an object that would implement this interface.

#### Outputs
An object conforming to this interface would have the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rmssd | Object (optional) | Contains RMSSD data |
| sdnn | Object (optional) | Contains SDNN data |

Each of these objects (rmssd and sdnn) can have:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| avg_millis | number (optional) | Average value in milliseconds |
| samples_millis | Sample[] (optional) | Array of Sample objects representing individual measurements |

#### Internal Logic
The interface defines two optional properties:

1. `rmssd`: Represents the Root Mean Square of Successive Differences, a time-domain measure of heart rate variability.
2. `sdnn`: Represents the Standard Deviation of NN Intervals, another time-domain measure of heart rate variability.

Both properties have the same structure, containing an optional average value (`avg_millis`) and an optional array of samples (`samples_millis`).

## References
- The `Sample` type is imported from "./sample", suggesting that there's another file defining this type.
- This interface is used in other parts of the codebase, specifically in the `Biometrics`, `Activity`, `ActivityLog`, and `Sleep` interfaces, as seen in the related code snippets.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./sample | Provides the `Sample` type used in the `samples_millis` property |

## Notes
1. The use of optional properties (`?`) throughout the interface allows for flexibility in data representation, as not all heart rate variability data may include both RMSSD and SDNN measurements, or may not always have both average values and samples.
2. The `Sample` type is likely used to represent individual measurements, possibly including a timestamp and a value, but its exact structure is not visible in this file.
3. The use of milliseconds for measurements is consistent with common practices in heart rate variability analysis.
4. This interface is used in various contexts within the API SDK, including biometrics, activity tracking, and sleep analysis, indicating its importance in health and fitness data representation.
