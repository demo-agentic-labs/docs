## High-level description
This code defines the `ActivityLog` interface, which represents a detailed log of a user's physical activity. It includes various properties such as metadata, duration, energy expenditure, movement details, location information, and biometric data. The interface is designed to be flexible and accommodate different types of activity data from various sources.

## Code Structure
The `ActivityLog` interface is the main symbol in this file. It imports and uses several other interfaces from related files to define its properties. These imported interfaces represent specific aspects of the activity data, such as durations, movement, energy expenditure, heart rate, and location.

## Symbols

### `ActivityLog`
#### Description
The `ActivityLog` interface represents a comprehensive log of a user's physical activity. It includes various optional properties to capture different aspects of the activity.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | Metadata | Required. Contains metadata about the activity log. |
| name | string | Optional. Name of the activity. |
| type | string | Optional. Type of the activity. |
| start_time | string | Optional. Start time of the activity. |
| end_time | string | Optional. End time of the activity. |
| durations | ActivityDurations | Optional. Duration details of the activity. |
| energy_expenditure | EnergyExpenditure | Optional. Energy expenditure details. |
| movement | ActivityMovement | Optional. Movement details of the activity. |
| location | object | Optional. Location information of the activity. |
| biometrics | object | Optional. Biometric data recorded during the activity. |

#### Internal Logic
The interface is structured to allow for flexible representation of activity data. It includes optional properties to accommodate various levels of detail that might be available from different data sources or devices.

## Dependencies
The `ActivityLog` interface depends on several other interfaces imported from related files:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActivityDurations | Represents duration details of the activity. |
| ActivityMovement | Represents movement details of the activity. |
| EnergyExpenditure | Represents energy expenditure data. |
| HeartRate | Represents heart rate data. |
| HeartRateVariability | Represents heart rate variability data. |
| LatLon | Represents latitude and longitude coordinates. |
| Metadata | Represents metadata about the activity log. |
| Respiration | Represents respiration data. |

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment suggesting the addition of laps and more time samples throughout the models in future iterations.

This interface provides a comprehensive structure for representing detailed activity logs, allowing for the inclusion of various types of data related to physical activities. It's designed to be flexible and extensible, accommodating different levels of detail from various data sources or devices.
