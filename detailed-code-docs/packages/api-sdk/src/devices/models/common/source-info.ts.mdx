## High-level description
This code defines an interface `SourceInfo` that represents information about the source of biometric data. It includes optional properties for the source type, ID, name, and type, providing a standardized structure for describing data sources in the context of biometric measurements.

### `SourceInfo`
#### Description
`SourceInfo` is an interface that defines the structure for source information related to biometric data. It encapsulates details about the origin of the data, which can be useful for tracking and validating the data source.

#### Inputs
This is an interface, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines a structure that objects can implement.

#### Outputs
Objects that implement this interface will have the following optional properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| source_type | SourceType | The type of the source, likely an enum defining different source categories |
| id | string | A unique identifier for the source |
| name | string | A human-readable name for the source |
| type | string | Additional type information about the source |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./source-type | Imports the `SourceType` enum, which is used to type the `source_type` property |

## References
The `SourceInfo` interface is used in other parts of the codebase, particularly in the `packages/api/src/mappings/tenovi/biometrics.ts` file. In this file, `SourceInfo` is used to provide metadata about the source of various biometric measurements, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.

For example, in the `mapToBiometrics` function, a `SourceInfo` object is created with the following properties:

```typescript
const sourceInfo: SourceInfo = {
  id: hwi_device_id,
  name: device_name,
  source_type: SourceType.device,
};
```

This `sourceInfo` object is then passed to various update functions (like `updateBiometricsWithBP`, `updateBiometricsWithHR`, etc.) to provide source information for each biometric measurement.

The usage of `SourceInfo` in this context allows for consistent tracking of data sources across different types of biometric measurements, enhancing the traceability and reliability of the data.
