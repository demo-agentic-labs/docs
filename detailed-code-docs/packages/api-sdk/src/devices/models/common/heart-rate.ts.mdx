## High-level description
This code defines the `HeartRate` interface, which represents heart rate data in a structured format. It includes various heart rate metrics such as minimum, maximum, average, and resting heart rates, as well as an array of heart rate samples.

## Symbols

### `HeartRate`
#### Description
The `HeartRate` interface defines the structure for heart rate data. It includes optional fields for various heart rate metrics and an array of heart rate samples.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the shape of an object that represents heart rate data.

#### Outputs
The interface defines the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| min_bpm | number (optional) | Minimum heart rate in beats per minute |
| max_bpm | number (optional) | Maximum heart rate in beats per minute |
| avg_bpm | number (optional) | Average heart rate in beats per minute |
| resting_bpm | number (optional) | Resting heart rate in beats per minute |
| samples_bpm | Sample[] (optional) | Array of heart rate samples |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Sample | Imported from "./sample", likely defines the structure for individual heart rate samples |

## References
The `HeartRate` interface is referenced in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `activity.ts`, it's used as part of the `Activity` interface's `biometrics` property.
2. In `activity-log.ts`, it's used in the `ActivityLog` interface's `biometrics` property.
3. In `sleep.ts`, it's included in the `SleepBiometrics` interface.
4. In `activity.ts` (Garmin mapping), it's used to structure heart rate data from Garmin activity summaries.
5. In `bloodPressure.ts` (Garmin mapping), it's used when mapping blood pressure data to biometrics.

These references indicate that the `HeartRate` interface is a core component in representing heart rate data across various types of health and activity data in the application.
