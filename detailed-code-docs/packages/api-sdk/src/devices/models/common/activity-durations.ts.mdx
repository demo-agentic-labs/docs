## High-level description
This code defines an interface `ActivityDurations` that represents various durations of activities and their intensities. It provides a structure for tracking active time and categorizing activity intensities into different levels, including a separate categorization for strain or stress levels.

## Symbols

### `ActivityDurations`
#### Description
The `ActivityDurations` interface defines a structure for representing different durations of activities and their intensities. It includes fields for active time, intensity levels, and strain levels.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the structure of an object that can be used elsewhere in the codebase.

#### Outputs
The interface defines the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| active_seconds | number (optional) | The total number of seconds of active time |
| intensity | object (optional) | An object representing different intensity levels of activity |
| strain | object (optional) | An object representing different strain or stress levels |

#### Internal Logic
The interface is structured with three main components:

1. `active_seconds`: A simple number representing the total active time in seconds.

2. `intensity`: An object that categorizes activity intensity into five levels:
   - rest_seconds
   - very_low_seconds
   - low_seconds
   - med_seconds
   - high_seconds

   Each of these is an optional number representing the duration in seconds for that intensity level.

3. `strain`: An object that categorizes strain or stress levels into six categories:
   - rest_seconds
   - very_low_seconds
   - low_seconds
   - med_seconds
   - high_seconds
   - very_high_seconds

   Similar to intensity, each of these is an optional number representing the duration in seconds for that strain level.

## References
The `ActivityDurations` interface is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/activity.ts`, it's used as part of the `Activity` interface's `summary` field.
2. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/common/activity-log.ts`, it's used as part of the `ActivityLog` interface's `durations` field.

These references suggest that `ActivityDurations` is a common structure used to represent activity durations in different contexts within the application.

## Notes
- The comment "also referred to as metabolic-equivalent minutes" for the `intensity` field suggests that this structure might be used in the context of fitness or health tracking applications.
- The comment "also referred to as stress" for the `strain` field indicates that this structure might be used to track stress levels or exertion over time.
- All fields in the interface are optional (marked with `?`), allowing for flexible use of the structure in different scenarios where not all data might be available.

This interface provides a comprehensive way to categorize and track activity durations across different intensity and strain levels, which could be valuable for applications in fitness tracking, health monitoring, or performance analysis.
