## High-level description
The `ActivityMovement` interface defines a structure for representing movement-related data in an activity tracking context. It encapsulates various metrics such as step count, floor count, elevation details, speed information, cadence, and distance traveled.

## Symbols

### `ActivityMovement`
#### Description
This interface represents a comprehensive set of movement-related metrics for an activity. It includes optional fields for various aspects of physical movement, allowing for flexible usage depending on the available data.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines a structure that can be implemented or used as a type.

#### Outputs
When used, this interface will produce an object with some or all of the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| steps_count | number (optional) | The number of steps taken during the activity |
| floors_count | number (optional) | The number of floors climbed during the activity |
| elevation | object (optional) | Details about elevation changes during the activity |
| speed | object (optional) | Information about the speed during the activity |
| avg_cadence | number (optional) | The average cadence (typically in steps per minute) during the activity |
| distance_meters | number (optional) | The total distance traveled in meters during the activity |

#### Internal Logic
The interface defines nested objects for `elevation` and `speed`:

1. `elevation` object:
   - `gain_meters`: The total elevation gain in meters
   - `min_meters`: The minimum elevation reached in meters
   - `max_meters`: The maximum elevation reached in meters

2. `speed` object:
   - `max_km_h`: The maximum speed reached in kilometers per hour
   - `avg_km_h`: The average speed in kilometers per hour

## References
The `ActivityMovement` interface is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/activity.ts`, it's used as part of the `Activity` interface's `summary` property.
2. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/common/activity-log.ts`, it's used as the type for the `movement` property in the `ActivityLog` interface.
3. In `packages/api/src/mappings/garmin/activity.ts`, it's used in the `activityToMovement` function to map Garmin activity data to the `ActivityMovement` structure.

## Dependencies
This interface doesn't depend on any external libraries or modules. It's a pure TypeScript interface definition.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a simple interface definition, there are no direct performance implications. However, when implementing this interface, consider that some properties are optional, allowing for efficient memory usage by including only the available data.
