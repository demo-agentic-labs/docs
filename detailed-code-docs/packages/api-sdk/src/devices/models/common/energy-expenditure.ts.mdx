## High-level description
This code defines an interface `EnergyExpenditure` that represents energy expenditure data for an activity. It includes fields for active calories burned, basal metabolic rate, and power output in watts.

## Symbols

### `EnergyExpenditure`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure for energy expenditure data. It contains optional fields related to calorie burn and power output.

#### Inputs
This is an interface, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the shape of an object.

#### Outputs
An object conforming to the `EnergyExpenditure` interface.

#### Internal Logic
The interface defines four optional properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| `active_kcal` | `number` | The number of active calories burned |
| `basal_metabolic_rate_kcal` | `number` | The basal metabolic rate in calories |
| `total_watts` | `number` | The total power output in watts |
| `avg_watts` | `number` | The average power output in watts |

All fields are optional, allowing for flexibility in data representation.

## References
The `EnergyExpenditure` interface is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/common/activity-log.ts`, it's imported and used as a type for the `energy_expenditure` property in the `ActivityLog` interface.

2. In `packages/api/src/mappings/garmin/activity.ts`, it's imported and used in the `activeKCalToEnergy` function, which creates an `EnergyExpenditure` object from active calories data.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript interface definition.

## Usage Examples
Based on the related code snippets:

1. In the `ActivityLog` interface:
   ```typescript
   export interface ActivityLog {
     // ...
     energy_expenditure?: EnergyExpenditure;
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. In the Garmin activity mapping:
   ```typescript
   export const activeKCalToEnergy = (active_kcal: number): EnergyExpenditure =&gt; ({
     active_kcal,
   });
   ```

These examples show how the `EnergyExpenditure` interface is used to type energy expenditure data in activity logs and how it's created from Garmin activity data.
