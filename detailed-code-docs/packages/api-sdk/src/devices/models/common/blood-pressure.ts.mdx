## High-level description
This code defines the `BloodPressure` interface, which represents blood pressure data with optional diastolic and systolic measurements. Each measurement type can contain an array of samples, allowing for multiple readings over time.

## Symbols

### `BloodPressure`
#### Description
The `BloodPressure` interface defines the structure for blood pressure data. It includes two optional properties: `diastolic_mm_Hg` and `systolic_mm_Hg`, each of which can contain an array of `Sample` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| diastolic_mm_Hg | object (optional) | Contains samples of diastolic blood pressure measurements |
| systolic_mm_Hg | object (optional) | Contains samples of systolic blood pressure measurements |

#### Internal Logic
- Both `diastolic_mm_Hg` and `systolic_mm_Hg` are optional properties.
- Each property, if present, contains a `samples` array of `Sample` objects.
- The `Sample` type is imported from the "./sample" module, suggesting that it's defined in a separate file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./sample" | Imports the `Sample` type used in the `BloodPressure` interface |

## References
The `BloodPressure` interface is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/biometrics.ts`, it's used as a property type in the `Biometrics` interface:
   ```typescript
   export interface Biometrics extends MetriportData {
     // ...
     blood_pressure?: BloodPressure;
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. In `packages/api/src/mappings/garmin/bloodPressure.ts`, it's used in functions that map Garmin blood pressure data to the `BloodPressure` interface:
   ```typescript
   export const mapToDiastolicSamples = (
     garminBloodPressure: GarminBloodPressure[]
   ): BloodPressure["diastolic_mm_Hg"] =&gt; {
     // ...
   };

   export const mapToSystolicSamples = (
     garminBloodPressure: GarminBloodPressure[]
   ): BloodPressure["systolic_mm_Hg"] =&gt; {
     // ...
   };
   ```

These references indicate that the `BloodPressure` interface is a crucial part of the data model for biometric information in the API SDK, and it's used in mapping functions to convert device-specific data (in this case, from Garmin devices) to a standardized format.
