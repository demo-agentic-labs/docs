## High-level description
This code defines an interface `Metadata` in TypeScript, which represents metadata information for various data types in the Metriport API SDK. It includes fields for date, hour, source, data source, and error information.

## Code Structure
The `Metadata` interface imports and uses two other interfaces: `ProviderSource` and `SourceInfo`. These are likely defined in separate files within the same directory.

## References
- `ProviderSource` from "./provider-source"
- `SourceInfo` from "./source-info"

### `Metadata`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure for metadata associated with various data types in the Metriport API SDK.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the shape of objects that conform to this interface.

#### Outputs
Objects that conform to this interface will have the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | string | The date associated with the data |
| hour | string | (Optional) The hour associated with the data |
| source | ProviderSource | The source of the data |
| data_source | SourceInfo | (Optional) Additional information about the data source |
| error | string | (Optional) Any error message associated with the data |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ProviderSource | Defines the type for the `source` field |
| SourceInfo | Defines the type for the `data_source` field |

## Usage in Related Files
1. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/metriport-data.ts`, the `Metadata` interface is used as a property in the `MetriportData` interface.

2. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/common/activity-log.ts`, the `Metadata` interface is used as a property in the `ActivityLog` interface.

3. In `packages/api/src/routes/helpers/provider-route-helper.ts`, the `Metadata` interface is used to create metadata objects when handling errors in data fetching.

4. In `packages/api/src/mappings/apple/index.ts`, the `Metadata` interface is imported and used in the `createMetadata` function to generate metadata for Apple Health data.

These usages demonstrate that the `Metadata` interface is a crucial part of the data structure in the Metriport API SDK, providing consistent metadata across various data types and sources.
