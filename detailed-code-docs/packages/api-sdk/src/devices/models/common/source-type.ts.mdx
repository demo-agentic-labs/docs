## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines an enumeration called `SourceType` that represents the possible sources of data entry in a system. It distinguishes between manual entry and device-generated data.

## Symbols

### `SourceType`
#### Description
`SourceType` is an enumeration that categorizes the origin of data in a system. It provides two distinct types: manual entry and device-generated data.

#### Enum Values
| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| manual | "MANUAL_ENTRY" | Represents data that has been entered manually by a user |
| device | "DEVICE" | Represents data that has been generated or collected by a device |

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies. It uses TypeScript's built-in `enum` feature.

## Usage
This enumeration can be used throughout the application to specify or check the source of data. For example:

```typescript
function processData(data: any, source: SourceType) {
  if (source === SourceType.manual) {
    // Handle manually entered data
  } else if (source === SourceType.device) {
    // Handle device-generated data
  }
}
```

This enum allows for type-safe comparisons and can help in making decisions based on the data source throughout the application.
