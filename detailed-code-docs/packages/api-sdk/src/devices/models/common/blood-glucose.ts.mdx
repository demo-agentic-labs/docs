## High-level description
This code defines an interface `BloodGlucose` in TypeScript, representing blood glucose data. It includes an optional average blood glucose level and an array of blood glucose samples, providing a structure for storing and managing blood glucose measurements.

## Symbols

### `BloodGlucose`
#### Description
The `BloodGlucose` interface defines the structure for blood glucose data. It contains two properties: an optional average blood glucose level and an array of blood glucose samples.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| avg_mg_dL | number \| undefined | Optional average blood glucose level in milligrams per deciliter |
| samples_mg_dL | Sample[] | Array of blood glucose samples |

#### Internal Logic
The interface doesn't contain any internal logic as it's a TypeScript interface definition. It serves as a contract for objects representing blood glucose data.

## References
- The `Sample` interface is imported from "./sample", which is defined in the related code snippet `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/common/sample.ts`.
- The `BloodGlucose` interface is used in the `Biometrics` interface defined in the related code snippet `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/biometrics.ts`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./sample | Imports the `Sample` interface used in the `samples_mg_dL` property |

## Additional Context
1. The `BloodGlucose` interface is part of a larger system for managing biometric data, as evidenced by its usage in the `Biometrics` interface.
2. The `Sample` interface, used for individual blood glucose measurements, includes properties for time, value, standard deviation, and data source, providing a comprehensive structure for each measurement.
3. The use of optional properties (e.g., `avg_mg_dL?`) allows for flexibility in data representation, accommodating scenarios where average values might not be available.
4. The naming convention (e.g., `mg_dL`) suggests that the blood glucose levels are measured in milligrams per deciliter, which is a common unit for blood glucose measurements.

This interface provides a standardized structure for representing blood glucose data, which can be useful in applications dealing with diabetes management, health monitoring, or general biometric data analysis.
