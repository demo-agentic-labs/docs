## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript interface `Respiration` that represents various respiratory metrics and measurements. It includes fields for VO2 max, blood oxygen levels (SpO2), breathing rate, lung capacity measurements, and time-series data of breaths per minute.

## Symbols

### `Respiration`
#### Description
The `Respiration` interface encapsulates various respiratory-related measurements and statistics. It provides a structured way to represent different aspects of a person's respiratory function.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the structure of an object that represents respiratory data.

#### Outputs
The interface defines the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| vo2_max | number \| undefined | Maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise |
| spo2 | object \| undefined | Blood oxygen saturation statistics |
| avg_breaths_per_minute | number \| undefined | Average number of breaths per minute |
| peak_flow_L_min | number \| undefined | Peak expiratory flow rate in liters per minute |
| forced_volume_L | number \| undefined | Forced expiratory volume in liters |
| samples_breaths_per_minute | Sample[] \| undefined | Time-series data of breaths per minute |

The `spo2` object, if present, contains the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| min_pct | number \| undefined | Minimum blood oxygen saturation percentage |
| max_pct | number \| undefined | Maximum blood oxygen saturation percentage |
| avg_pct | number \| undefined | Average blood oxygen saturation percentage |
| std_dev | number \| undefined | Standard deviation of blood oxygen saturation |

#### Internal Logic
The interface doesn't contain any internal logic as it's a type definition. It provides a structure for representing respiratory data, allowing for optional fields to accommodate varying levels of data availability.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Sample | Imported from "./sample", used for the `samples_breaths_per_minute` field |

## References
The `Respiration` interface is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/biometrics.ts`, it's used as a field in the `Biometrics` interface.
2. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/activity.ts`, it's used within the `Activity` interface's `summary.biometrics` object.
3. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/common/activity-log.ts`, it's used within the `ActivityLog` interface's `biometrics` object.

These references indicate that the `Respiration` interface is a key component in representing respiratory data across different contexts in the application, including overall biometrics and activity-related data.
