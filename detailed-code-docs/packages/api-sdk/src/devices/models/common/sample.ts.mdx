## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript interface `Sample` that represents a data sample with a timestamp, value, optional standard deviation, and optional source information. It is likely used for storing and managing time-series data in a structured format.

## Symbols

### `Sample`
#### Description
The `Sample` interface defines the structure for a single data point or measurement. It includes essential information about the measurement, such as the time it was taken, its value, and optional fields for standard deviation and data source.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the shape of objects that conform to this interface.

#### Outputs
Objects that implement this interface will have the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| time | string | The timestamp of the sample |
| value | number | The numerical value of the sample |
| std_dev | number \| undefined | Optional standard deviation of the sample |
| data_source | SourceInfo \| undefined | Optional information about the data source |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SourceInfo | Imported from "./source-info" to provide type information for the optional `data_source` property |

## References
The `Sample` interface is referenced in the related file `blood-glucose.ts`, where it is used to type an array of blood glucose samples:

```typescript
export interface BloodGlucose {
  avg_mg_dL?: number;
  samples_mg_dL: Sample[];
}
```

This suggests that the `Sample` interface is likely used across multiple data types in the application, providing a consistent structure for time-series data points.
