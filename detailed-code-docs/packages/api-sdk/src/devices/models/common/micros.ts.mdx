## High-level description
This code defines an interface `Micros` that represents various micronutrients in milligrams. It's part of a larger system for tracking nutritional information, likely used in a health or fitness application.

## Code Structure
The `Micros` interface is a standalone structure that defines properties for different micronutrients. It's used in other parts of the codebase, specifically in the `Nutrition` and `Food` interfaces, as seen in the related code snippets.

## References
- Used in `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/nutrition.ts` as part of the `Nutrition` interface
- Used in `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/common/food.ts` as part of the `Food` interface

### Micros
#### Description
The `Micros` interface defines a structure for representing various micronutrients in milligrams. Each property is optional, allowing for flexible use in different contexts where not all micronutrient information may be available.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines a structure that objects can conform to.

#### Outputs
When used, an object conforming to this interface will have some or all of the defined properties, each representing the amount of a specific micronutrient in milligrams.

#### Internal Logic
The interface simply defines the structure, with each property being optional (denoted by the `?` after the property name) and of type `number`.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a TypeScript interface definition that relies only on the built-in `number` type.

## Performance Considerations
As this is just an interface definition, there are no direct performance implications. However, when used in larger data structures or arrays, the number of properties (25 in total) could potentially impact memory usage if many instances are created.
