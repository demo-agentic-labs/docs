## High-level description
This code defines an enumeration called `ProviderSource` that represents various health and fitness data providers. It serves as a centralized list of supported providers for the Metriport API SDK, ensuring consistency and type safety when referring to different data sources throughout the application.

### `ProviderSource`
#### Description
`ProviderSource` is an enumeration that lists all the supported health and fitness data providers in the Metriport API SDK. Each enum value corresponds to a specific provider's name in lowercase.

#### Inputs
This enumeration does not have inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
This enumeration does not have outputs as it's a type definition.

#### Internal Logic
The enumeration defines the following providers:
- `apple`: Represents Apple Health
- `cronometer`: Represents Cronometer
- `dexcom`: Represents Dexcom
- `fitbit`: Represents Fitbit
- `garmin`: Represents Garmin
- `google`: Represents Google Fit
- `oura`: Represents Oura Ring
- `tenovi`: Represents Tenovi
- `whoop`: Represents Whoop
- `withings`: Represents Withings

Each provider is defined as a string literal with the same value as its key, ensuring type safety and easy string representation.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies.

## References
The `ProviderSource` enum is referenced and used in other parts of the codebase, as seen in the related code snippets:

1. In `packages/api/src/shared/constants.ts`, the enum is imported and used to define constants for each provider.
2. In `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/client/metriport.ts`, the enum is used in method signatures, particularly for the `connectRpmProvider` and `disconnectDevice` methods.

These references indicate that the `ProviderSource` enum plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency across the SDK when dealing with different data providers.
