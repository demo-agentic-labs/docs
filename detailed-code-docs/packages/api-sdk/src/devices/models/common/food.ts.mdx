## High-level description
This code defines an interface `Food` in TypeScript, which represents a food item with its nutritional information. It's part of a larger API SDK for handling nutrition and health-related data, likely used in a health or fitness application.

## Code Structure
The `Food` interface is composed of basic food information and a nested `nutrition_facts` object that contains macronutrients, micronutrients, and amino acids information. It imports and uses three other interfaces: `Aminos`, `Macros`, and `Micros`.

## References
This code references:
- `Aminos` from "./aminos"
- `Macros` from "./macros"
- `Micros` from "./micros"

### `Food`
#### Description
The `Food` interface defines the structure for a food item, including its basic information and nutritional content.

#### Inputs
This is an interface, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the shape of an object.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string (optional) | The name of the food item |
| brand | string (optional) | The brand of the food item |
| amount | number (optional) | The quantity of the food item |
| unit | string (optional) | The unit of measurement for the amount |
| nutrition_facts | object (optional) | Contains detailed nutritional information |

#### Outputs
As an interface, it doesn't produce outputs. It's used to type-check objects that should conform to this structure.

#### Internal Logic
The `nutrition_facts` property is an optional nested object with three optional properties:
- `macros`: of type `Macros`, likely containing macronutrient information
- `micros`: of type `Micros`, likely containing micronutrient information
- `aminos`: of type `Aminos`, likely containing amino acid information

## Dependencies
The code depends on three imported interfaces:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Aminos | Defines the structure for amino acid information |
| Macros | Defines the structure for macronutrient information |
| Micros | Defines the structure for micronutrient information |

Based on the related code snippets, we can see that:

1. The `Aminos` interface defines various amino acids with their amounts in grams.
2. The `Macros` interface defines macronutrients like carbs, protein, fat, etc., with their amounts in various units (g, mg, kcal, ml).
3. The `Micros` interface defines micronutrients like vitamins and minerals with their amounts in milligrams.

These interfaces are used to provide a comprehensive nutritional profile for a food item.

The `Food` interface is also exported and used in other parts of the API SDK, as seen in the `index.ts` file, making it a key component of the nutrition-related functionality in this SDK.
