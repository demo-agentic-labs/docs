## High-level description
The `macros.ts` file defines an interface `Macros` that represents the macronutrient and related nutritional information for a food item. It includes optional properties for various nutritional components such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and energy content.

## Symbols

### `Macros`
#### Description
The `Macros` interface defines a structure for storing macronutrient information of a food item. It includes optional properties for various nutritional components, allowing for flexible representation of nutritional data.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines a structure that can be implemented by objects.

#### Outputs
When implemented, an object of type `Macros` can contain any or all of the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alcohol_g | number | Optional. Amount of alcohol in grams. |
| carbs_g | number | Optional. Amount of carbohydrates in grams. |
| cholesterol_mg | number | Optional. Amount of cholesterol in milligrams. |
| energy_kcal | number | Optional. Energy content in kilocalories. |
| fat_g | number | Optional. Amount of total fat in grams. |
| fiber_g | number | Optional. Amount of dietary fiber in grams. |
| protein_g | number | Optional. Amount of protein in grams. |
| sodium_mg | number | Optional. Amount of sodium in milligrams. |
| sugar_g | number | Optional. Amount of sugar in grams. |
| trans_fat_g | number | Optional. Amount of trans fat in grams. |
| water_ml | number | Optional. Amount of water in milliliters. |

## References
The `Macros` interface is referenced in the `Food` interface defined in the `food.ts` file. It is used as part of the `nutrition_facts` property of a `Food` object.

## Dependencies
This file has no external dependencies. It's a standalone TypeScript interface definition.

## Notes
1. All properties in the `Macros` interface are optional, allowing for partial representation of nutritional information when complete data is not available.
2. The interface uses specific units for each nutrient (e.g., grams for most macronutrients, milligrams for sodium and cholesterol, milliliters for water, and kilocalories for energy), ensuring consistency in data representation.
3. The inclusion of `alcohol_g` and `water_ml` alongside traditional macronutrients provides a more comprehensive nutritional profile.
4. This interface can be used in various nutrition-related applications, such as food tracking apps, dietary analysis tools, or nutritional databases.
5. The optional nature of all properties allows for flexibility in data input and storage, accommodating scenarios where certain nutritional information might not be available or relevant.
