## High-level description
This code defines a simple TypeScript interface `LatLon` that represents a geographical coordinate with latitude and longitude. It provides a standardized structure for storing and passing location data within the application.

### `LatLon`
#### Description
`LatLon` is a TypeScript interface that defines the structure for representing a geographical coordinate using latitude and longitude.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lat | number | The latitude component of the coordinate |
| lon | number | The longitude component of the coordinate |

#### Outputs
This interface doesn't produce any outputs as it's a type definition.

## References
The `LatLon` interface is referenced in the `ActivityLog` interface from the `activity-log.ts` file. It's used to define the `start_lat_lon_deg` and `end_lat_lon_deg` properties within the `location` object of an activity log.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in types.

## Usage Context
Based on the related code snippet from `activity-log.ts`, we can see that the `LatLon` interface is used in the context of activity logging, specifically for recording the start and end locations of an activity. This suggests that the application likely deals with tracking user activities that have geographical components, such as fitness or travel-related features.

The `ActivityLog` interface uses `LatLon` as follows:

```typescript
location?: {
  start_lat_lon_deg?: LatLon;
  end_lat_lon_deg?: LatLon;
  // ... other location-related properties
};
```

This usage indicates that activities can have optional starting and ending geographical coordinates, which are represented using the `LatLon` interface.
