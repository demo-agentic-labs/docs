## High-level description
This code defines a type `Sex` in TypeScript, which represents the biological sex of a person. It is a simple type alias that allows only two possible string values: "male" or "female".

## Symbols

### `Sex`
#### Description
`Sex` is a TypeScript type alias that represents the biological sex of a person. It is defined as a union type of two string literals: "male" and "female".

#### Inputs
This type does not have inputs as it is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
This type does not have outputs as it is a type definition, not a function.

## References
The `Sex` type is referenced in the `User` interface defined in the `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/user.ts` file. It is used as the type for the optional `sex` property of the `User` interface.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in type system features.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a simple type definition, there are no performance considerations to note. Type aliases in TypeScript are resolved at compile-time and do not impact runtime performance.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API endpoint, this type can be considered part of the internal API of the SDK. It can be used in other parts of the codebase to ensure type safety when dealing with sex-related data.

| Type | Possible Values | Description |
|:-----|:----------------|:------------|
| Sex  | "male", "female" | Represents the biological sex of a person |

## Notes
1. This type definition is quite restrictive, allowing only "male" or "female" as valid values. Depending on the requirements of the application, it might be worth considering whether this binary representation is sufficient or if a more inclusive approach is needed.

2. The type is exported, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the codebase. This promotes consistency in how sex is represented across the application.

3. The file is located in a "common" directory, suggesting that this type might be used in multiple places within the devices models.

4. The simplicity of this type definition makes it easy to understand and use, but it also limits the possible values to just two options. If more granularity or inclusivity is required in the future, this type might need to be expanded or replaced with a more flexible representation.
