## High-level description
This code defines an interface `Aminos` that represents the amino acid content of a food item. It provides a structure for storing the quantities of 20 different amino acids, each measured in grams.

## Symbols

### `Aminos`
#### Description
The `Aminos` interface is a TypeScript interface that defines the structure for representing amino acid content. Each property in the interface corresponds to a specific amino acid, and the value represents the amount of that amino acid in grams.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, when creating an object of this type, you can provide values for any or all of the amino acids listed.

#### Outputs
This interface doesn't produce outputs directly. It's used as a type definition for objects that represent amino acid content.

#### Internal Logic
The interface uses optional properties (denoted by the `?` after each property name) for all amino acids. This means that when creating an object of type `Aminos`, you can include only the amino acids for which you have data, without needing to specify all 20.

## References
The `Aminos` interface is referenced in the `Food` interface defined in the related file `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/common/food.ts`. It's used as part of the `nutrition_facts` property of a `Food` object.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript interface definition.

## Configuration
There are no configuration options for this interface. It's a fixed structure representing the 20 standard amino acids.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this interface defines a structure that can be used in other parts of the application. Here's a table of the properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| alanine_g | number (optional) | Amount of alanine in grams |
| arginine_g | number (optional) | Amount of arginine in grams |
| asparagine_g | number (optional) | Amount of asparagine in grams |
| aspartic_acid_g | number (optional) | Amount of aspartic acid in grams |
| cysteine_g | number (optional) | Amount of cysteine in grams |
| glutamine_g | number (optional) | Amount of glutamine in grams |
| glutamic_acid_g | number (optional) | Amount of glutamic acid in grams |
| glycine_g | number (optional) | Amount of glycine in grams |
| histidine_g | number (optional) | Amount of histidine in grams |
| isoleucine_g | number (optional) | Amount of isoleucine in grams |
| leucine_g | number (optional) | Amount of leucine in grams |
| lysine_g | number (optional) | Amount of lysine in grams |
| methionine_g | number (optional) | Amount of methionine in grams |
| phenylalanine_g | number (optional) | Amount of phenylalanine in grams |
| proline_g | number (optional) | Amount of proline in grams |
| serine_g | number (optional) | Amount of serine in grams |
| threonine_g | number (optional) | Amount of threonine in grams |
| tryptophan_g | number (optional) | Amount of tryptophan in grams |
| tyrosine_g | number (optional) | Amount of tyrosine in grams |
| valine_g | number (optional) | Amount of valine in grams |

This interface provides a comprehensive structure for representing the amino acid profile of a food item, which can be useful in nutritional analysis or dietary planning applications.
