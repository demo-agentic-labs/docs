## High-level description
This code defines the `Temperature` interface in TypeScript, which represents temperature-related data for a device or system. It includes structures for core and skin temperatures, with average values and sample data, as well as a delta temperature value.

## Symbols

### `Temperature`
#### Description
The `Temperature` interface defines the structure for temperature-related data. It includes optional properties for core temperature, skin temperature, and a delta temperature value.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the shape of an object that conforms to this interface.

#### Outputs
Objects that implement this interface will have the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| core | object (optional) | Contains core temperature data |
| core.avg_celcius | number (optional) | Average core temperature in Celsius |
| core.samples_celcius | Sample[] (optional) | Array of core temperature samples |
| delta_celcius | number (optional) | Temperature difference in Celsius |
| skin | object (optional) | Contains skin temperature data |
| skin.avg_celcius | number (optional) | Average skin temperature in Celsius |
| skin.samples_celcius | Sample[] (optional) | Array of skin temperature samples |

#### Internal Logic
The interface uses nested objects to group related temperature data. Both `core` and `skin` properties have the same structure, containing an average temperature and an array of samples. The `delta_celcius` property is separate, representing a temperature difference.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Sample | Imported from "./sample", likely defines the structure for individual temperature samples |

## References
This `Temperature` interface is referenced in the `Biometrics` interface from the file `packages/api-sdk/src/devices/models/biometrics.ts`. It's used as the type for the optional `temperature` property in the `Biometrics` interface.

## Notes
1. All properties in the `Temperature` interface are optional, allowing for flexibility in data representation.
2. The use of `celcius` in property names suggests that temperatures are consistently represented in Celsius.
3. The `Sample` type is imported but not defined in this file, indicating it's likely a reusable type for various kinds of sample data.
4. The `delta_celcius` property could represent a temperature difference, possibly between core and skin temperatures or between two time points.
5. This interface is part of a larger SDK for API interactions, likely related to health or environmental monitoring devices.
