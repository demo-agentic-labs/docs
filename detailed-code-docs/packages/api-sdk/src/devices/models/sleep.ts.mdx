## High-level description
This code defines interfaces and types for sleep-related data in a health tracking application. It includes structures for sleep duration, biometrics during sleep, and overall sleep information. The code is part of a larger SDK for handling various types of health data.

## Code Structure
The main `Sleep` interface extends `MetriportData` and contains properties for sleep timing, durations, biometrics, and wakeup frequency. It references two sub-interfaces: `SleepDurations` and `SleepBiometrics`, which provide more detailed information about sleep stages and physiological measurements during sleep.

## Symbols

### `Sleep`
#### Description
An interface representing sleep data, extending the `MetriportData` interface.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| start_time | string (optional) | The start time of the sleep session |
| end_time | string (optional) | The end time of the sleep session |
| durations | SleepDurations (optional) | Detailed breakdown of sleep durations |
| biometrics | SleepBiometrics (optional) | Biometric data recorded during sleep |
| wakeup_frequency | number (optional) | Number of times the user woke up during sleep |

### `SleepDurations`
#### Description
An interface representing various durations related to a sleep session.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| total_seconds | number (optional) | Total sleep duration in seconds |
| awake_seconds | number (optional) | Time spent awake in seconds |
| deep_seconds | number (optional) | Time spent in deep sleep in seconds |
| rem_seconds | number (optional) | Time spent in REM sleep in seconds |
| light_seconds | number (optional) | Time spent in light sleep in seconds |
| in_bed_seconds | number (optional) | Total time spent in bed in seconds |
| time_to_fall_asleep_seconds | number (optional) | Time taken to fall asleep in seconds |
| no_data_seconds | number (optional) | Time with no recorded data in seconds |

### `SleepBiometrics`
#### Description
An interface representing biometric data recorded during sleep.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| heart_rate | HeartRate (optional) | Heart rate data during sleep |
| hrv | HeartRateVariability (optional) | Heart rate variability data during sleep |
| respiration | Respiration (optional) | Respiration data during sleep |
| temperature | Temperature (optional) | Body temperature data during sleep |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| HeartRate | Represents heart rate data |
| HeartRateVariability | Represents heart rate variability data |
| Respiration | Represents respiration data |
| Temperature | Represents temperature data |
| MetriportData | Base interface for Metriport data types |

This code provides a structured way to represent sleep-related data, including timing, durations, and various biometric measurements. It's designed to be used as part of a larger health data SDK, allowing for consistent handling of sleep information across different parts of an application or system.
