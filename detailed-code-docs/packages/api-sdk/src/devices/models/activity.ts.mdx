## High-level description
This file defines the `Activity` interface, which represents activity data for a user. It extends the `MetriportData` interface and includes summary information about durations, energy expenditure, movement, and biometrics, as well as an array of activity logs.

## Code Structure
The `Activity` interface is composed of several nested interfaces, each representing different aspects of activity data. These nested interfaces are imported from other files in the same directory.

### `Activity`
#### Description
The `Activity` interface represents a user's activity data, including summary information and detailed activity logs.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the structure of an object that would contain activity data.

#### Outputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have outputs. It defines the structure of an object that would be used to represent activity data.

#### Internal Logic
The `Activity` interface extends `MetriportData` and contains two optional properties:
1. `summary`: An object containing summary data about the activity.
2. `activity_logs`: An array of `ActivityLog` objects, representing individual activity sessions.

The `summary` object includes:
- `durations`: An `ActivityDurations` object
- `energy_expenditure`: An `EnergyExpenditure` object
- `movement`: An `ActivityMovement` object
- `biometrics`: An object containing heart rate, HRV, and respiration data

## Dependencies
The file imports several interfaces from other files in the same directory:
- `ActivityDurations` from "./common/activity-durations"
- `ActivityLog` from "./common/activity-log"
- `ActivityMovement` from "./common/activity-movement"
- `EnergyExpenditure` from "./common/energy-expenditure"
- `HeartRate` from "./common/heart-rate"
- `HeartRateVariability` from "./common/heart-rate-variability"
- `Respiration` from "./common/respiration"
- `MetriportData` from "./metriport-data"

These imported interfaces are used to define the structure of the `Activity` interface.
