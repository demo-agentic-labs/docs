## High-level description
This code defines the `Nutrition` interface, which represents nutrition-related data in the Metriport API SDK. It extends the `MetriportData` interface and includes optional properties for summarizing macronutrients, micronutrients, amino acids, and a list of foods consumed.

## Code Structure
The `Nutrition` interface extends `MetriportData` and contains two optional properties: `summary` and `foods`. The `summary` property is an object that can include `macros`, `micros`, and `aminos` data. The `foods` property is an array of `Food` objects.

## References
This code references the following imported types:
- `Aminos` from "./common/aminos"
- `Macros` from "./common/macros"
- `Micros` from "./common/micros"
- `Food` from "./common/food"
- `MetriportData` from "./metriport-data"
