## High-level description
This code defines the `Body` interface, which represents body-related data in the Metriport API SDK. It extends the `MetriportData` interface and includes various optional properties related to body measurements such as body fat percentage, height, weight, and other body composition metrics.

## Symbols

### Body
#### Description
The `Body` interface extends `MetriportData` and represents body-related data. It contains optional properties for various body measurements and composition metrics.

#### Inputs
This interface doesn't have inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
The interface defines the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body_fat_pct | number (optional) | Body fat percentage |
| height_cm | number (optional) | Height in centimeters |
| weight_kg | number (optional) | Weight in kilograms |
| bone_mass_kg | number (optional) | Bone mass in kilograms |
| muscle_mass_kg | number (optional) | Muscle mass in kilograms |
| lean_mass_kg | number (optional) | Lean mass in kilograms |
| max_possible_heart_rate_bpm | number (optional) | Maximum possible heart rate in beats per minute |
| weight_samples_kg | Sample[] (optional) | Array of weight samples |

## Dependencies
The code imports the following dependencies:
- `MetriportData` from "./metriport-data"
- `Sample` from "./common/sample"

## References
This interface is referenced and used in various parts of the codebase, including:
- Mapping functions in different provider-specific modules (e.g., Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Google, Oura, Tenovi)
- The `getBodyData` method in provider classes
- The body route handler in the API

The `Body` interface serves as a standardized structure for body-related data across different data sources and providers in the Metriport ecosystem.
