## High-level description
This file defines the `Biometrics` interface, which extends `MetriportData`. It represents various biometric measurements such as blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration, and temperature. The interface is designed to store and structure biometric data collected from different health devices or sources.

### Biometrics
#### Description
The `Biometrics` interface extends `MetriportData` and defines a structure for storing various biometric measurements.

#### Inputs
This interface doesn't have inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
The interface defines the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| blood_glucose | BloodGlucose (optional) | Blood glucose measurements |
| blood_pressure | BloodPressure (optional) | Blood pressure measurements |
| heart_rate | HeartRate (optional) | Heart rate measurements |
| hrv | HeartRateVariability (optional) | Heart rate variability measurements |
| perfusion_index_pct | number (optional) | Perfusion index percentage |
| respiration | Respiration (optional) | Respiration-related measurements |
| temperature | Temperature (optional) | Temperature measurements |

## References
The `Biometrics` interface references several other interfaces:
- `MetriportData`
- `BloodGlucose`
- `BloodPressure`
- `HeartRate`
- `HeartRateVariability`
- `Respiration`
- `Temperature`

These referenced interfaces are imported from separate files within the same directory.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment suggesting the potential addition of an ECG (Electrocardiogram) property to the `Biometrics` interface in the future.

## Dependencies
The file imports several dependencies from other files within the project:
- `BloodGlucose` from "./common/blood-glucose"
- `BloodPressure` from "./common/blood-pressure"
- `HeartRate` from "./common/heart-rate"
- `HeartRateVariability` from "./common/heart-rate-variability"
- `Respiration` from "./common/respiration"
- `Temperature` from "./common/temperature"
- `MetriportData` from "./metriport-data"

These dependencies are likely other interfaces or types that define the structure of specific biometric measurements.
