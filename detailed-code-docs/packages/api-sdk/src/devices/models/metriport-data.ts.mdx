## High-level description
This code defines the `MetriportData` interface, which serves as a base structure for various types of data in the Metriport API SDK. It includes a `metadata` field of type `Metadata`, providing a consistent way to include metadata across different data types.

### `MetriportData`
#### Description
`MetriportData` is an interface that represents the basic structure for data objects in the Metriport API SDK. It contains a single property, `metadata`, which is of type `Metadata`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | Metadata | An object containing metadata information |

## References
The `MetriportData` interface references the `Metadata` interface, which is imported from "./common/metadata".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./common/metadata | Imports the `Metadata` interface used in `MetriportData` |

## Code Structure
The `MetriportData` interface serves as a base interface for other data types in the Metriport API SDK. It is used in various parts of the codebase, such as in the `Sleep` interface (from the related code snippets) and in webhook-related functions.

The `Metadata` interface (from the related code snippets) includes fields like `date`, `hour`, `source`, `data_source`, and `error`, providing a standardized way to include metadata across different data types.

Other parts of the codebase, such as the webhook handling for Garmin data and the devices webhook processing, make use of the `MetriportData` interface when working with various types of health and fitness data.

This structure allows for a consistent approach to handling different types of data within the Metriport ecosystem, ensuring that all data objects have a common metadata structure while allowing for specific data fields in the implementing interfaces.
