## High-level description
This code defines the `User` interface, which represents user data in the Metriport API SDK. It extends the `MetriportData` interface and includes optional fields for various user attributes such as age, name, location, and sex.

## Code Structure
The `User` interface extends `MetriportData` and defines several optional properties.

## Symbols

### `User`
#### Description
An interface that represents user data in the Metriport API SDK. It extends the `MetriportData` interface and includes optional fields for various user attributes.

#### Inputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the structure of a user object.

#### Outputs
This is an interface definition, so it doesn't have outputs. It defines the structure that user data should conform to.

#### Internal Logic
The interface defines the following optional properties:
- `age`: number
- `first_name`: string
- `last_name`: string
- `city`: string
- `country`: string
- `date_of_birth`: string
- `email`: string
- `region`: string (can be state, province, etc.)
- `sex`: Sex (imported from "./common/sex")

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `Sex` | Imported from "./common/sex" to define the type for the `sex` property |
| `MetriportData` | The base interface that `User` extends |

## Notes
1. All fields in the `User` interface are optional, as indicated by the `?` after each property name.
2. The `region` field is noted to potentially represent a state, province, or similar geographic division.
3. The `Sex` type is imported from a separate file, suggesting it's a custom type (likely an enum or union type) defined elsewhere in the project.
4. This interface is likely used throughout the Metriport API SDK to ensure consistency in user data structure and typing.
