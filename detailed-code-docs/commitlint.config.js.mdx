## High-level description
This file configures commitlint, a tool used to enforce conventional commit messages in a project. It extends the conventional commit configuration and adds a custom rule for the commit footer while ignoring certain automated version bump commits.

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object for commitlint. It defines the rules and settings that will be used to lint commit messages in the project.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object contains three main parts:
1. `extends`: Specifies the base configuration to use.
2. `rules`: Defines custom rules or overrides existing ones.
3. `ignores`: Specifies commit messages to ignore during linting.

Let's break down each part:

1. `extends`: 
   ```javascript
   extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"]
   ```
   This line extends the `@commitlint/config-conventional` configuration, which provides a set of standard rules for conventional commit messages.

2. `rules`:
   ```javascript
   rules: {
       "footer-empty": [2, "never"],
   }
   ```
   This section overrides or adds rules. In this case, it sets the `footer-empty` rule to `[2, "never"]`, which means:
   - `2`: The rule is treated as an error (will cause the commit to fail).
   - `"never"`: The footer should never be empty.

3. `ignores`:
   ```javascript
   ignores: [(message) =&gt; /^Bumps \[.+]\(.+\) from .+ to .+\.$/m.test(message)]
   ```
   This section defines a function that determines which commit messages to ignore. It uses a regular expression to match commit messages that start with "Bumps [...](...) from ... to ...". This is typically used to ignore automated dependency update commits, such as those created by Dependabot.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @commitlint/config-conventional | Provides the base configuration for conventional commit messages |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| extends | array | ["@commitlint/config-conventional"] | Specifies the base configuration to extend |
| rules | object | \{ "footer-empty": [2, "never"] \} | Defines custom rules or overrides existing ones |
| ignores | array of functions | [(message) =&gt; /^Bumps \[.+]\(.+\) from .+ to .+\.$/m.test(message)] | Specifies commit messages to ignore during linting |

This configuration ensures that commit messages follow the conventional commit format, with an additional requirement for a non-empty footer. It also ignores automated dependency update commits, allowing for a more streamlined development process when using tools like Dependabot.
