## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file, named "PR Check - Utils", is designed to run checks on pull requests that affect the "packages/utils" directory. It triggers on pull requests, merge group events, and manual workflow dispatches, executing commit checks and build processes for the utils package.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`, both of which reuse existing workflow files.
