title: "pull-request_commonwell-sdk.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a set of checks to be run on pull requests that affect the `commonwell-sdk` package. It ensures that commits are properly formatted and that the package builds successfully before allowing the pull request to be merged.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`, both of which use reusable workflows defined in separate files.

## Symbols

### Workflow Name
#### Description
The workflow is named "PR Check - commonwell-sdk", which clearly indicates its purpose of checking pull requests for the commonwell-sdk package.

### Trigger Events
#### Description
The workflow is triggered by three events:
1. Pull requests that modify files in the `packages/commonwell-sdk/` directory.
2. Merge group events (likely related to GitHub's merge queue feature).
3. Manual workflow dispatch.

### Jobs

#### `check-commits`
##### Description
This job uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml` to check the format and content of commits in the pull request.

##### Inputs
None specified in this file.

##### Outputs
None specified in this file.

##### Internal Logic
The actual logic for checking commits is contained in the referenced workflow file.

#### `check-pr`
##### Description
This job uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/_build.yml` to build and check the commonwell-sdk package.

##### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to the package directory ("packages/commonwell-sdk") |

##### Outputs
None specified in this file.

##### Internal Logic
The actual logic for building and checking the package is contained in the referenced workflow file.

## Dependencies
This workflow depends on two other workflow files:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml | Checks the format and content of commits |
| ./.github/workflows/_build.yml | Builds and checks the commonwell-sdk package |

## Configuration
The workflow uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| secrets | inherit | N/A | Inherits secrets from the calling workflow or repository |

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly defined in this workflow file. It likely relies on the default behavior of GitHub Actions and the error handling implemented in the reusable workflows.

This workflow provides a streamlined approach to checking pull requests for the commonwell-sdk package, ensuring code quality and build integrity before merging changes.
