## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Branch to Staging," is designed to manually deploy a branch to the staging environment. It orchestrates the deployment of API, infrastructure, and API Gateway, followed by running end-to-end tests.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of four main jobs: `api`, `infra-api-lambdas`, `redeploy-api-gw`, and `e2e-tests`. These jobs are executed in a specific order, with some dependencies between them.

## Symbols

### `api`
#### Description
This job deploys the API to the staging environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Set to "staging" |
| ECR_REPO_URI | string | ECR repository URI for staging |
| ECS_CLUSTER | string | ECS cluster for staging |
| ECS_SERVICE | string | ECS service for staging |
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for staging API |

#### Internal Logic
The job uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/_deploy-api.yml` and passes the necessary inputs and secrets for deployment.

### `infra-api-lambdas`
#### Description
This job deploys the infrastructure and API lambdas to the staging environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Set to "staging" |
| is-branch-to-staging | boolean | Set to true |
| secrets_cdk_stack | string | Secret stack name for staging |
| location_services_cdk_stack | string | Location services stack name for staging |
| cdk_stack | string | API stack name for staging |
| ihe_stack | string | IHE stack name |
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for staging API |

#### Internal Logic
The job uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/_deploy-cdk.yml` and passes the necessary inputs and secrets for deployment.

### `redeploy-api-gw`
#### Description
This job redeploys the API Gateway after the infrastructure and API lambdas have been deployed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Set to "staging" |
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for staging API |
| API_GW_ID | string | API Gateway ID for staging |

#### Internal Logic
The job uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/_redeploy_api-gw.yml` and passes the necessary inputs and secrets for redeployment. It depends on the completion of the `infra-api-lambdas` job.

### `e2e-tests`
#### Description
This job runs end-to-end tests after the API, infrastructure, and API Gateway have been deployed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Set to "staging" |
| api_url | string | API URL for staging |
| fhir_url | string | FHIR server URL for staging |
| test_patient_id | string | Test patient ID |

#### Internal Logic
The job uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/_e2e-tests.yml` and passes the necessary inputs and secrets for running the tests. It depends on the completion of the `api`, `infra-api-lambdas`, and `redeploy-api-gw` jobs. The job will run even if one of the dependencies didn't succeed, as long as at least one of them was successful.

## Dependencies
This workflow relies on several reusable workflows:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| _deploy-api.yml | Deploys the API |
| _deploy-cdk.yml | Deploys infrastructure and API lambdas |
| _redeploy_api-gw.yml | Redeploys the API Gateway |
| _e2e-tests.yml | Runs end-to-end tests |

## Configuration
The workflow uses various GitHub Actions variables and secrets for configuration:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| vars.ECR_REPO_URI_STAGING | string | ECR repository URI for staging |
| vars.ECS_CLUSTER_STAGING | string | ECS cluster for staging |
| vars.ECS_SERVICE_STAGING | string | ECS service for staging |
| vars.API_REGION_STAGING | string | AWS region for staging API |
| vars.SECRET_STACK_NAME_STAGING | string | Secret stack name for staging |
| vars.LOCATION_SERVICES_STACK_NAME_STAGING | string | Location services stack name for staging |
| vars.API_STACK_NAME_STAGING | string | API stack name for staging |
| vars.IHE_STACK_NAME | string | IHE stack name |
| vars.API_GW_ID_STAGING | string | API Gateway ID for staging |
| vars.API_URL_STAGING | string | API URL for staging |
| vars.FHIR_SERVER_URL_STAGING | string | FHIR server URL for staging |
| vars.TEST_PATIENT_ID | string | Test patient ID |

Various secrets are also used, such as AWS credentials, Sentry tokens, DockerHub credentials, and other environment-specific secrets.
