## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "PR Check - Others," is designed to handle pull requests that don't involve changes to the main packages. It marks required checks as successful for PRs that can be merged when no changes are detected in the specified package directories.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of three jobs: `files-changed`, `check-pr`, and `not-running`. These jobs work together to detect changes in specific package directories and determine whether to mark the PR check as successful or not.

## Symbols

### `files-changed` job
#### Description
This job detects changes in the specified package directories.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| packages | boolean | Indicates whether changes were detected in the specified package directories |

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs in to Docker Hub using provided secrets.
2. Checks out the repository.
3. Uses the `dorny/paths-filter` action to detect changes in specified package directories.

### `check-pr` job
#### Description
This job marks the PR check as successful if no changes were detected in the package directories.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs only if `files-changed.outputs.packages` is not 'true'.
2. Executes a simple echo command to mark the 'check-pr' as successful.

### `not-running` job
#### Description
This job runs when changes are detected in the package directories but doesn't modify the 'check-pr' status.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs only if `files-changed.outputs.packages` is 'true'.
2. Executes a simple echo command to indicate that no changes are being made to the 'check-pr' status.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| docker/login-action@v2 | Used to log in to Docker Hub |
| actions/checkout@v3 | Used to check out the repository |
| dorny/paths-filter@4067d885736b84de7c414f582ac45897079b0a78 | Used to detect changes in specific directories |

## Configuration
The workflow is triggered on pull requests, merge group events, and manual workflow dispatch.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | secret | N/A | Username for Docker Hub authentication |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | secret | N/A | Token for Docker Hub authentication |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the default GitHub Actions behavior.

## Performance Considerations
The `files-changed` job has a timeout of 3 minutes to prevent long-running checks.
