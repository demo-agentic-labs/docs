## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines automated checks for pull requests and merge groups targeting the "react-native-sdk" package. It runs commit checks and a build process specifically for the React Native SDK component of the project.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`, both of which use reusable workflows defined in separate files.
