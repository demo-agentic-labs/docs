title: "pull-request_fhir-converter.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a CI/CD pipeline for the `fhir-converter` package. It runs on pull requests, merge group events, and can be manually triggered. The workflow checks commit messages, sets up the environment, and runs linting and tests for the package.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`. The `check-commits` job is reused from another workflow file, while the `check-pr` job is defined in this file with multiple steps to set up the environment, build, and test the package.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Defines the name of the GitHub Actions workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the workflow |

### `on`
#### Description
Specifies the events that trigger the workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | object | Configures the workflow to run on pull requests |
| merge_group | null | Triggers the workflow on merge group events |
| workflow_dispatch | null | Allows manual triggering of the workflow |

### `jobs`
#### Description
Defines the jobs to be executed in the workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| check-commits | object | Job to check commit messages |
| check-pr | object | Job to run linting and tests |

### `check-pr`
#### Description
Defines the main job for checking the pull request, including environment setup, building, and testing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runs-on | string | Specifies the runner environment |
| env | object | Sets environment variables for the job |
| steps | array | Defines the steps to be executed in the job |

#### Internal Logic
1. Log the environment variables
2. Login to Docker Hub
3. Setup Node.js
4. Checkout the repository
5. Log the Git reference
6. Install dependencies
7. Run build (linters)
8. Run tests

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/setup-node@v3 | Set up Node.js environment |
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checkout the repository |
| docker/login-action@v2 | Login to Docker Hub |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| working-directory | string | "./packages/fhir-converter" | Sets the working directory for the job |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of stopping the workflow if any step fails.

## Logging
The workflow includes two specific logging steps:
1. Log Environment: Prints all environment variables
2. Log Git Ref: Prints the current Git reference (commit hash)

These logging steps help with debugging and provide context for the workflow execution.
