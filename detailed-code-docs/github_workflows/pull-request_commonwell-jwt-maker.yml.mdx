## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a set of checks to be run on pull requests that affect the `commonwell-jwt-maker` package. It ensures that commits are properly formatted and that the package builds successfully before allowing the pull request to be merged.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`, both of which use reusable workflows defined in separate files.

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on pull requests that modify files in the `packages/commonwell-jwt-maker` directory, when a merge group is created, or manually via workflow dispatch.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | event | Pull request event data |
| merge_group | event | Merge group event data |
| workflow_dispatch | event | Manual workflow dispatch event data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the trigger events for the workflow.
2. Specifies two jobs to be run: `check-commits` and `check-pr`.

### Job: check-commits
#### Description
This job uses a reusable workflow defined in `.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml` to verify the format and content of commits in the pull request.

#### Inputs
None specified in this file.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the reusable workflow `.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml` with inherited secrets.

### Job: check-pr
#### Description
This job uses a reusable workflow defined in `.github/workflows/_build.yml` to build and check the `commonwell-jwt-maker` package.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to the package directory |

#### Internal Logic
Uses the reusable workflow `.github/workflows/_build.yml` with the specified path and inherited secrets.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml | Reusable workflow for checking commits |
| ./.github/workflows/_build.yml | Reusable workflow for building and checking the package |

## Notes
- The workflow is specifically tailored for the `commonwell-jwt-maker` package.
- It uses reusable workflows, which helps maintain consistency across different packages and reduces duplication.
- The `secrets: inherit` statement ensures that necessary secrets are passed to the reusable workflows.
- The workflow is triggered only when changes are made to files within the `packages/commonwell-jwt-maker` directory, optimizing CI/CD resources.
