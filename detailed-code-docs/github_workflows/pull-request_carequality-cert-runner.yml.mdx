## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a CI/CD process for the "carequality-cert-runner" package. It is triggered on pull requests that modify files within the specified package, when a merge group is created, or manually via workflow dispatch. The workflow performs commit checks and runs a build process for the package.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`. These jobs are defined using reusable workflows, which are referenced using the `uses` keyword.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Specifies the name of the GitHub Actions workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the workflow |

### `on`
#### Description
Defines the events that trigger the workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | object | Configures the workflow to run on pull request events |
| merge_group | null | Triggers the workflow when a merge group is created |
| workflow_dispatch | null | Allows manual triggering of the workflow |

### `jobs`
#### Description
Defines the jobs to be executed as part of the workflow.

#### Internal Logic
The `jobs` section contains two job definitions:

1. `check-commits`: Uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml`
2. `check-pr`: Uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/_build.yml`

Both jobs inherit secrets from the calling workflow.

### `check-commits` (job)
#### Description
Runs a commit checking process using a reusable workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| uses | string | Path to the reusable workflow file |
| secrets | string | Specifies that secrets should be inherited |

### `check-pr` (job)
#### Description
Runs a build process for the "carequality-cert-runner" package using a reusable workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| uses | string | Path to the reusable workflow file |
| with | object | Input parameters for the reusable workflow |
| secrets | string | Specifies that secrets should be inherited |

## Dependencies
This workflow depends on two other workflow files:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

| ./.github/workflows/_build.yml | Runs the build process for the package |
