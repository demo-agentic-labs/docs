## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file, named "_check-commits.yml", is designed to check commit messages on non-shared branches. It runs when called by another workflow and performs a check to ensure that commit messages follow the Conventional Commits standard.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "check-commit-messages" with several steps that set up the environment, log in to Docker Hub, checkout the repository, and run the commit message check.

## Symbols

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by a workflow call and requires two secrets: DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | secret | Docker Hub username for authentication |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | secret | Docker Hub token for authentication |

### Job: check-commit-messages
#### Description
This job runs on Ubuntu and checks commit messages on non-shared branches (excluding 'master' and 'develop').

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the environment variables
2. Logs in to Docker Hub using provided credentials
3. Checks out the repository with a fetch depth of 100 commits
4. Runs the commitlint-github-action to check commit messages against Conventional Commits standard

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| docker/login-action@v2 | To log in to Docker Hub |
| actions/checkout@v3 | To check out the repository |
| wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5 | To check commit messages against Conventional Commits standard |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| runs-on | string | ubuntu-latest | Specifies the runner environment |
| if | expression | $\{\{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref != 'master' && github.event.pull_request.head.ref != 'develop' \}\} | Condition to run the job only on non-shared branches |
| fetch-depth | number | 100 | Number of commits to fetch when checking out the repository |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of stopping the workflow if any step fails.

## Logging
The workflow includes a step to log environment variables, which can be useful for debugging purposes.
