## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "PR Check - Lambdas", is designed to run checks on pull requests that modify files in the "packages/lambdas" directory. It also triggers on merge group events and can be manually dispatched. The workflow performs commit checks and runs a build process specific to the lambdas package.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`. Both jobs reuse existing workflow files, passing along necessary inputs and secrets.
