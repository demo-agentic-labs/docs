### `Release Python SDK` (Workflow)
#### Description
This workflow automates the process of releasing a Python SDK. It is triggered manually and requires a version input.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version of the SDKs to be released |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Node.js environment
3. Installs Fern CLI globally
4. Generates and releases the SDK using Fern

### `release` (Job)
#### Description
This job contains the steps necessary to release the Python SDK.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on the latest Ubuntu environment
2. Executes a series of steps to prepare the environment and release the SDK

### Steps
1. **Checkout repo**
   - Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to clone the repository

2. **Setup node**
   - Uses `actions/setup-node@v3` to set up a Node.js environment

3. **Download Fern**
   - Installs the Fern CLI globally using npm

4. **Release SDKs**
   - Runs the Fern generate command to create and release the SDK
   - Uses environment variables for authentication
   - Specifies the Python SDK group, version, and debug logging

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | To clone the repository |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | To set up Node.js environment |
| fern-api (npm package) | CLI tool for generating and releasing SDKs |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| FERN_TOKEN | secret | N/A | Authentication token for Fern |
| PYPI_TOKEN | secret | N/A | Authentication token for PyPI |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of stopping the workflow if any step fails.

## Logging
The Fern generate command includes the `--log-level debug` flag, which enables detailed logging for troubleshooting purposes.
