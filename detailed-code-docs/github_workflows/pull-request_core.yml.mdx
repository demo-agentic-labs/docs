## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "PR Check - Core", is designed to run checks on pull requests that affect the "packages/core" directory. It also triggers on merge group events and can be manually dispatched. The workflow performs commit checks and builds the core package.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`. Both jobs reuse existing workflow files, passing along necessary inputs and secrets.

### Workflow: PR Check - Core
#### Description
This workflow defines the conditions for execution and the jobs to be run for pull requests affecting the core package.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | event | Triggered on pull requests affecting "packages/core" |
| merge_group | event | Triggered on merge group events |
| workflow_dispatch | event | Allows manual triggering of the workflow |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the trigger events for the workflow.
2. Specifies two jobs to be executed: `check-commits` and `check-pr`.
3. Both jobs use reusable workflows, inheriting secrets from the caller.

### Job: check-commits
#### Description
This job runs commit checks using a reusable workflow.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `./.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml` workflow.
- Inherits secrets from the caller workflow.

### Job: check-pr
#### Description
This job builds the core package using a reusable workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | Specifies the path to the core package |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `./.github/workflows/_build.yml` workflow.
- Passes the "packages/core" path as an input.
- Inherits secrets from the caller workflow.
