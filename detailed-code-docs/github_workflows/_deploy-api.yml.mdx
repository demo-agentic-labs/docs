title: "_deploy-api.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a reusable GitHub Actions workflow for deploying an API. It handles building, testing, and deploying the API to different environments (staging, production, or sandbox) using AWS services like ECR and ECS.

## Code Structure
The workflow is structured as a single job named "deploy" with multiple steps that handle different aspects of the deployment process, including environment setup, building, testing, and deploying the API.

## Symbols

### Workflow
#### Description
This is a reusable workflow that can be called from other workflows. It's designed to deploy an API to different environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | Sub-directory where the workflow should execute lint and build (default: "packages/api") |
| deploy_env | string | The environment to deploy to (staging, production, or sandbox) |
| script_name | string | The name of the script under the scripts/ folder to run (default: "deploy-api.sh") |
| ECR_REPO_URI | string | The URI of the ECR repository to push the Docker image to |
| ECS_CLUSTER | string | The ARN of the ECS cluster containing the service to be restarted upon deployment |
| ECS_SERVICE | string | The ARN of the ECS service to be restarted upon deployment |
| AWS_REGION | string | The AWS region for deployment |

#### Secrets
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS access key ID |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS secret access key |
| SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN | Sentry authentication token (optional) |
| SENTRY_ORG | Sentry organization (optional) |
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | DockerHub username |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | DockerHub token |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the deployment environment and logs relevant information
2. Logs in to DockerHub
3. Sets up NodeJS
4. Checks out the code repository
5. Installs dependencies
6. Builds and compiles the project
7. Runs tests
8. Creates a Sentry release (if configured)
9. Sets up AWS CLI
10. Sets up Docker
11. Runs the deployment script

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/setup-node@v3 | Sets up Node.js environment |
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checks out the repository |
| getsentry/action-release@v1 | Creates a Sentry release |
| docker/login-action@v2 | Logs in to DockerHub |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| concurrency.group | string | N/A | Prevents concurrent deployments to the same environment |
| runs-on | string | ubuntu-latest | Specifies the runner environment |
| environment | string | N/A | Sets the deployment environment |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of stopping the workflow if any step fails.

## Logging
The workflow includes several logging steps:
1. Logging the environment variables
2. Logging the Git reference
3. Various steps output their results, which are logged by default in GitHub Actions

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment suggesting consideration of a solution for preventing concurrent deployments, referencing a GitHub Actions workflow: https://github.com/tj-actions/aws-cdk/blob/main/action.yml
