## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file, named "PR Check - Shared," is designed to run checks on pull requests that affect the "packages/shared" directory. It also triggers on merge group events and can be manually dispatched. The workflow performs commit checks and builds the shared package.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`. Both jobs reuse existing workflow files, passing along necessary parameters and secrets.
