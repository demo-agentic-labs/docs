## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a reusable workflow for re-deploying an AWS API Gateway. It is designed to be called from other workflows and requires specific inputs and secrets to execute the re-deployment process.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "redeploy-api-gw" with several steps that prepare the environment and execute the re-deployment script.

### Workflow: Re-deploy API Gateway
#### Description
This workflow is designed to re-deploy an AWS API Gateway after a CDK deployment. It can be called from other workflows and requires specific inputs and secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | The environment being deployed to (staging, production, or sandbox) |
| AWS_REGION | string | The AWS region for deployment |
| API_GW_ID | string | The ID of the API Gateway to be redeployed |

#### Secrets
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS access key ID for authentication |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS secret access key for authentication |
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | DockerHub username for authentication |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | DockerHub token for authentication |

#### Internal Logic
1. Log the environment variables
2. Login to Docker Hub
3. Checkout the repository
4. Execute the re-deployment script

### Job: redeploy-api-gw
#### Description
This job runs on the latest Ubuntu runner and performs the actual re-deployment of the API Gateway.

#### Steps
1. **Log Environment**: Prints all environment variables for debugging purposes.
2. **Login to Docker Hub**: Authenticates with DockerHub using provided credentials.
3. **Checkout**: Checks out the repository code.
4. **Re-deploy API GW**: Executes a shell script to re-deploy the API Gateway.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| docker/login-action@v2 | Used for logging into Docker Hub |
| actions/checkout@v3 | Used for checking out the repository code |

## Configuration
The workflow is configured using input parameters and secrets, which are passed when the workflow is called.

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of stopping the workflow if any step fails.

## Logging
The workflow includes a step to log all environment variables, which can be useful for debugging purposes.

## TODOs
- The script `./packages/scripts/redeploy-api-gateway.sh` is referenced but not provided in this file. It would be beneficial to review this script to understand the specific re-deployment process.
- Consider adding error handling or retry mechanisms for the re-deployment step, as network operations can sometimes fail transiently.
- The workflow currently logs all environment variables, which might include sensitive information. Consider logging only non-sensitive information or removing this step in production environments.
