## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Deploy - Staging," is designed to automate the deployment process for a staging environment. It triggers on pushes to the 'develop' branch that affect specific packages or can be manually executed. The workflow detects changes, deploys API and infrastructure components, and runs end-to-end tests.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of several jobs that depend on each other:
1. `files-changed`: Detects changes in specific directories
2. `api`: Deploys the API (conditional)
3. `infra-api-lambdas`: Deploys infrastructure and lambdas (conditional)
4. `redeploy-api-gw`: Redeploys the API Gateway
5. `e2e-tests`: Runs end-to-end tests

## Symbols

### `files-changed` job
#### Description
This job detects changes in specific directories and sets output variables for other jobs to use.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| api | boolean | Indicates if API-related files have changed |
| fhir-converter | boolean | Indicates if FHIR converter files have changed |
| infra-lambdas | boolean | Indicates if infrastructure or lambda files have changed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs in to Docker Hub
2. Checks out the repository
3. Uses `dorny/paths-filter` action to detect changes in specific file paths
4. Sets output variables based on detected changes

### `api` job
#### Description
This job deploys the API if changes are detected in API-related files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Deployment environment (staging) |
| ECR_REPO_URI | string | ECR repository URI for staging |
| ECS_CLUSTER | string | ECS cluster for staging |
| ECS_SERVICE | string | ECS service for staging |
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for staging API |

### `infra-api-lambdas` job
#### Description
This job deploys infrastructure and lambdas if changes are detected in related files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Deployment environment (staging) |
| secrets_cdk_stack | string | Secrets CDK stack name |
| location_services_cdk_stack | string | Location services CDK stack name |
| cdk_stack | string | API CDK stack name |
| ihe_stack | string | IHE stack name |
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for staging API |

### `redeploy-api-gw` job
#### Description
This job redeploys the API Gateway after infrastructure changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Deployment environment (staging) |
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for staging API |
| API_GW_ID | string | API Gateway ID for staging |

### `e2e-tests` job
#### Description
This job runs end-to-end tests after deployments are complete.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Deployment environment (staging) |
| api_url | string | API URL for staging |
| fhir_url | string | FHIR server URL for staging |
| test_patient_id | string | Test patient ID |

## Dependencies
The workflow uses several GitHub Actions:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| docker/login-action@v2 | Log in to Docker Hub |
| actions/checkout@v3 | Check out the repository |
| dorny/paths-filter@4067d885736b84de7c414f582ac45897079b0a78 | Detect file changes |

## Configuration
The workflow uses various environment variables and secrets for configuration:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| vars.* | various | Environment-specific variables (e.g., ECR_REPO_URI_STAGING, ECS_CLUSTER_STAGING) |
| secrets.* | various | Sensitive information (e.g., AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN) |

## Error Handling
The workflow uses conditional job execution based on the success of previous jobs and detected changes. The `e2e-tests` job runs even if some previous jobs were skipped, as long as at least one deployment job succeeded.

## API/Interface Reference
This workflow file defines a GitHub Actions workflow, which is triggered by:
| Trigger | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| push to 'develop' branch | Automated trigger when specific packages are modified |
| workflow_dispatch | Manual trigger by a user |

The workflow automates the deployment process for a staging environment, including API deployment, infrastructure updates, and end-to-end testing.
