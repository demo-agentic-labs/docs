---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Release SDKs," is designed to automate the process of releasing Software Development Kits (SDKs) for multiple programming languages. It can be manually triggered and requires a version input. The workflow generates and releases Node.js, Java, and Python SDKs using the Fern API generator.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "release" with several steps that set up the environment, install dependencies, and generate SDKs for different programming languages.

## Symbols

### `release` (job)
#### Description
This job runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and contains all the steps necessary to generate and release the SDKs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Node.js
3. Installs the Fern API generator
4. Generates and releases SDKs for Node.js, Java, and Python

### `Checkout repo` (step)
#### Description
This step checks out the repository code using the `actions/checkout@v3` action.

### `Setup node` (step)
#### Description
This step sets up the Node.js environment using the `actions/setup-node@v3` action.

### `Download Fern` (step)
#### Description
This step installs the Fern API generator globally using npm.

### `Release SDKs` (step)
#### Description
This step generates and releases the SDKs for Node.js, Java, and Python using the Fern API generator.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up environment variables using GitHub secrets for authentication
2. Runs the `fern generate` command for each SDK (Node.js, Java, and Python) with the specified version and debug logging

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | To check out the repository code |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | To set up the Node.js environment |
| fern-api | To generate and release SDKs |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | string | N/A | The version of the SDKs to be released |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the default behavior of GitHub Actions to stop the workflow if any step fails.

## Logging
The `fern generate` commands use the `--log-level debug` flag, which enables detailed logging for troubleshooting purposes.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
