## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Restart IHE GW", is designed to restart the IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Gateway service in either a staging or production environment. It allows manual triggering with options to select the server type (currently only 'inbound') and the environment type (staging or production).

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two jobs: `prepare-env` and `restart-inbound`. The `prepare-env` job sets up environment variables based on the input choices, while the `restart-inbound` job uses a reusable workflow to restart the ECS (Elastic Container Service) service.

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered manually and restarts the IHE Gateway service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | choice | Inbound server selection (currently only 'inbound' option) |
| env_type | choice | Environment type selection (staging or production) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets environment variables based on the selected environment type.
2. Prepares the environment variables in the `prepare-env` job.
3. Conditionally runs the `restart-inbound` job if the server input is 'inbound'.
4. Uses a reusable workflow to restart the ECS service.

### `prepare-env` Job
#### Description
This job sets up the environment variables needed for the restart operation.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ecrRepoUri | string | ECR repository URI for the selected environment |
| ecsCluster | string | ECS cluster name for the selected environment |
| ecsServiceInbound | string | ECS service name for the inbound server in the selected environment |

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on the latest Ubuntu runner.
2. Executes a null command (`echo "null"`) as a placeholder step.
3. Sets job outputs using the environment variables defined at the workflow level.

### `restart-inbound` Job
#### Description
This job is responsible for restarting the inbound ECS service using a reusable workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ECR_REPO_URI | string | ECR repository URI |
| ECS_CLUSTER | string | ECS cluster name |
| ECS_SERVICE | string | ECS service name |
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for the staging environment |

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs only if the server input is 'inbound'.
2. Depends on the `prepare-env` job.
3. Uses a reusable workflow located at `./.github/workflows/_restart-ecs.yml`.
4. Passes the necessary inputs and secrets to the reusable workflow.

## Dependencies
The workflow depends on the following external resources:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AWS ECS | For managing and restarting the container service |
| AWS ECR | For storing Docker images |
| DockerHub | For authentication (likely used in the reusable workflow) |

## Configuration
The workflow uses GitHub Actions variables and secrets for configuration:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| IHE_ECR_REPO_URI_PRODUCTION | string | ECR repository URI for production |
| IHE_ECR_REPO_URI_STAGING | string | ECR repository URI for staging |
| IHE_ECS_CLUSTER_PRODUCTION | string | ECS cluster name for production |
| IHE_ECS_CLUSTER_STAGING | string | ECS cluster name for staging |
| IHE_INBOUND_ECS_SERVICE_PRODUCTION | string | ECS service name for inbound server in production |
| IHE_INBOUND_ECS_SERVICE_STAGING | string | ECS service name for inbound server in staging |
| IHE_REGION_STAGING | string | AWS region for the staging environment |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on GitHub Actions' default error handling mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This workflow is triggered manually through the GitHub Actions interface:
| Input | Type | Options | Description |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| server | choice | inbound | Selection of the inbound server |
| env_type | choice | staging, production | Selection of the environment type |
