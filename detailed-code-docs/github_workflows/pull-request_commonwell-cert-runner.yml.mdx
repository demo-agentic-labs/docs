## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a CI/CD process for the "commonwell-cert-runner" package. It is triggered on pull requests that modify files within the specified package, when a merge group is created, or manually via workflow dispatch. The workflow performs commit checks and runs a build process for the package.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`. Both jobs reuse existing workflow files, passing along necessary parameters and secrets.
