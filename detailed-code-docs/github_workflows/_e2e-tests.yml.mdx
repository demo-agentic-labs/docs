title: "_e2e-tests.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a reusable GitHub Actions workflow for running end-to-end (E2E) tests on an API. It sets up the necessary environment, installs dependencies, builds the project, and executes E2E tests using various input parameters and secrets for different deployment environments.

## Code Structure
The workflow is structured into a single job named "test" with multiple steps that handle setup, build, and test execution. It uses input parameters and secrets to configure the test environment and provide necessary credentials.

### Workflow
#### Description
This is a reusable workflow that can be called from other workflows. It is designed to run E2E tests for an API in different deployment environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | The deployment environment (staging, production, or sandbox) |
| api_url | string | The URL for the OSS API |
| fhir_url | string | The URL for the FHIR server |
| test_patient_id | string | The ID of a test patient for E2E tests (optional) |

#### Secrets
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS access key ID |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS secret access key |
| TEST_API_KEY | API key for testing |
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | DockerHub username |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | DockerHub token |
| NGROK_AUTHTOKEN | Ngrok authentication token (optional) |
| CW_CERTIFICATE | CommonWell certificate (optional) |
| CW_PRIVATE_KEY | CommonWell private key (optional) |
| CW_MEMBER_CERTIFICATE | CommonWell member certificate (optional) |
| CW_MEMBER_PRIVATE_KEY | CommonWell member private key (optional) |
| CW_MEMBER_OID | CommonWell member OID (optional) |
| CW_MEMBER_NAME | CommonWell member name (optional) |

### Job: test
#### Description
This job runs the E2E tests on an Ubuntu latest runner in the specified deployment environment.

#### Steps
1. Login to Docker Hub
2. Setup NodeJS (version 18.14)
3. Checkout the repository
4. Log Git reference
5. Install dependencies
6. Build/compile the project
7. Setup AWS CLI
8. Run E2E tests
9. Store test results as artifacts

#### Internal Logic
The job performs the following key actions:
1. Sets up the necessary environment (Node.js, Docker, AWS CLI)
2. Installs project dependencies
3. Builds the project
4. Runs E2E tests with various environment variables set
5. Stores test results as artifacts, regardless of test outcome

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| docker/login-action@v2 | Logging into Docker Hub |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | Setting up Node.js environment |
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checking out the repository |
| actions/upload-artifact@v4 | Storing test results as artifacts |

## Configuration
The workflow uses various environment variables and secrets to configure the test environment. These are passed to the E2E test execution step.

## Error Handling
The workflow uses the `if: always()` condition on the "Store Test Results" step to ensure that test results are uploaded as artifacts even if the tests fail.

## API/Interface Reference
This workflow is designed to be called by other workflows, with the following interface:

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| deploy_env | string | Yes | Deployment environment |
| api_url | string | Yes | OSS API URL |
| fhir_url | string | Yes | FHIR server URL |
| test_patient_id | string | No | Test patient ID |

Various secrets are also required, as listed in the Secrets section above.
