## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines automated checks for pull requests and merge groups related to the Carequality SDK. It triggers on pull requests that modify files in the "packages/carequality-sdk" directory, merge group events, and manual workflow dispatches.

The workflow consists of two jobs: "check-commits" and "check-pr", both of which use reusable workflows defined in separate files.
