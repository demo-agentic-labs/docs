## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a set of checks to be run on pull requests that affect the "api-sdk" package. It ensures that commits are properly formatted and that the package builds successfully before allowing the pull request to be merged.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`, both of which use reusable workflows defined in separate files.

## Symbols

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on pull requests that modify files in the "packages/api-sdk" directory, when a merge group is created, or manually via workflow dispatch.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | event | Pull request event data |
| merge_group | event | Merge group event data |
| workflow_dispatch | event | Manual workflow trigger event data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the trigger events for the workflow.
2. Specifies two jobs to be run: `check-commits` and `check-pr`.
3. Uses reusable workflows for each job, passing necessary parameters and secrets.

### Job: check-commits
#### Description
This job uses a reusable workflow to check the format and content of commits in the pull request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ./.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml | workflow | Reusable workflow file for checking commits |

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `_check-commits.yml` workflow, passing along inherited secrets.

### Job: check-pr
#### Description
This job uses a reusable workflow to build and check the "api-sdk" package.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ./.github/workflows/_build.yml | workflow | Reusable workflow file for building and checking the package |
| path | string | The path to the package to be built ("packages/api-sdk") |

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `_build.yml` workflow, passing the package path as a parameter and inherited secrets.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml | Reusable workflow for checking commits |
| ./.github/workflows/_build.yml | Reusable workflow for building and checking packages |
