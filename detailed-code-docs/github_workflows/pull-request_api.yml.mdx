## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file, named "PR Check - API", is designed to run checks on pull requests that affect the API package. It triggers on pull requests that modify files in the "packages/api" directory, merge group events, and manual workflow dispatches.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two jobs: `check-commits` and `check-pr`, both of which reuse existing workflow files.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Defines the name of the GitHub Actions workflow as "PR Check - API".

### `on`
#### Description
Specifies the events that trigger this workflow.

#### Internal Logic
- Triggers on pull requests that modify files in the "packages/api" directory
- Triggers on merge group events
- Allows manual triggering through workflow dispatch

### `jobs`
#### Description
Defines the jobs to be executed as part of this workflow.

#### Internal Logic
1. `check-commits`: Reuses the `.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml` workflow
2. `check-pr`: Reuses the `.github/workflows/_build.yml` workflow with specific inputs

### `check-commits`
#### Description
A job that runs commit checks using a reusable workflow.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `./.github/workflows/_check-commits.yml` workflow
- Inherits secrets from the calling workflow

### `check-pr`
#### Description
A job that runs build checks for the API package using a reusable workflow.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `./.github/workflows/_build.yml` workflow
- Specifies the `path` input as "packages/api"
- Inherits secrets from the calling workflow
