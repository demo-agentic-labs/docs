## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files that define various automated processes for the project, including CI/CD pipelines, release processes, and operational tasks like restarting services. The workflows cover a range of activities such as running tests, deploying to different environments, releasing SDKs, and performing infrastructure updates.

## What does it do?
The workflows in this directory automate several key processes:

1. Continuous Integration: Checking commits, running linters, and executing tests on pull requests for different packages.
2. Continuous Deployment: Deploying the API, infrastructure, and other components to staging, production, and sandbox environments.
3. SDK Management: Generating and releasing SDKs for multiple programming languages (Node.js, Java, Python).
4. Service Management: Restarting API services in different environments.
5. End-to-End Testing: Running E2E tests against staging environments.
6. Infrastructure as Code: Deploying and updating AWS resources using CDK.

These workflows help maintain code quality, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure consistent deployment processes across different environments.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these workflows are:

1. Pull request workflows: Triggered when pull requests are opened or updated for specific packages.
2. Deployment workflows: Triggered on pushes to main branches or manually for deploying to different environments.
3. Release workflows: Manually triggered to release new versions of SDKs.
4. Restart workflows: Manually triggered to restart services in different environments.
5. E2E test workflows: Manually triggered to run end-to-end tests against staging environments.

Each workflow file typically defines when it should be triggered (e.g., on pull request, on push, or manual dispatch) and what jobs and steps should be executed.

## Key Files
1. `_build.yml`: A reusable workflow for building and testing packages.
2. `_check-commits.yml`: A reusable workflow for checking commit messages.
3. `_deploy-api.yml`: A reusable workflow for deploying the API.
4. `_deploy-cdk.yml`: A reusable workflow for deploying infrastructure using CDK.
5. `_e2e-tests.yml`: A reusable workflow for running end-to-end tests.
6. `deploy-production.yml`: Workflow for deploying to the production environment.
7. `deploy-staging.yml`: Workflow for deploying to the staging environment.
8. `release-all-sdks.yml`: Workflow for releasing SDKs for multiple languages.
9. Various `pull-request_*.yml` files: Workflows for checking and building specific packages on pull requests.
10. Various `restart_*.yml` files: Workflows for restarting services in different environments.

## Dependencies
The workflows rely on several external actions and services:

1. GitHub Actions: The underlying platform for running the workflows.
2. AWS Services: Many workflows interact with AWS services like ECR, ECS, and use AWS credentials.
3. Docker: Used for containerization and authentication with DockerHub.
4. Node.js: Used in many workflows for building and testing JavaScript/TypeScript packages.
5. Fern: A tool used for generating and releasing SDKs.
6. Various GitHub Actions: Such as `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, and `docker/login-action`.

## Configuration
The workflows use a combination of GitHub secrets and variables for configuration:

1. AWS credentials: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
2. Docker credentials: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
3. Environment-specific variables: ECR URIs, ECS cluster names, API URLs, etc.
4. SDK-related tokens: `FERN_TOKEN`, `NPM_TOKEN`, `PYPI_TOKEN`, `MAVEN_USERNAME`, `MAVEN_PASSWORD`
5. Service-specific secrets: Various certificates and keys for different services

These configurations allow the workflows to be flexible and work across different environments while keeping sensitive information secure.

Have fun!
