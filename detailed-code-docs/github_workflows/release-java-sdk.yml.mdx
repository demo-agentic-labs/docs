## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Release Java SDK", is designed to automate the release process for Java and Python SDKs. It can be manually triggered and requires a version input. The workflow checks out the repository, sets up Node.js, installs Fern CLI, and uses it to generate and release the SDKs.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "release" with several steps that execute sequentially to perform the SDK release process.

### Workflow: Release Java SDK
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow automates the release process for Java and Python SDKs using Fern.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version of the Java SDK to be released |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Node.js environment
3. Installs Fern CLI globally using npm
4. Generates and releases Java SDK using Fern
5. Generates and releases Python SDK using Fern

### Job: release
#### Description
Defines the main job that runs on the latest Ubuntu runner and contains all the steps for the release process.

#### Steps
1. **Checkout repo**: Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to clone the repository
2. **Setup node**: Uses `actions/setup-node@v3` to set up Node.js environment
3. **Download Fern**: Installs Fern CLI globally using npm
4. **Release SDKs**: Runs Fern commands to generate and release Java and Python SDKs

### Step: Release SDKs
#### Description
This step uses Fern CLI to generate and release both Java and Python SDKs.

#### Environment Variables
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| FERN_TOKEN | Secret token for Fern authentication |
| MAVEN_USERNAME | Username for Maven repository |
| MAVEN_PASSWORD | Password for Maven repository |

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs `fern generate` command for Java SDK with specified version and debug logging
2. Runs `fern generate` command for Python SDK with specified version and debug logging

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | To check out the repository |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | To set up Node.js environment |
| fern-api | CLI tool for generating and releasing SDKs |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| runs-on | string | ubuntu-latest | Specifies the runner environment |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of stopping the workflow if any step fails.

## Logging
The workflow uses debug-level logging for the Fern generate commands, which can be useful for troubleshooting if issues arise during the SDK generation process.
