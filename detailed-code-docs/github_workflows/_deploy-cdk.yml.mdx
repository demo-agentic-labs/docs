## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a reusable deployment process based on AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit). It's designed to deploy various stacks (Secrets, Location Services, API, and IHE) to different environments (staging, production, or sandbox) using CDK.

## Code Structure
The workflow is structured as a single job named "deploy" with multiple steps that handle checkout, setup, building, testing, and deploying different components of the application.

### Workflow
#### Description
This is a reusable workflow that can be called from other workflows. It handles the deployment of CDK stacks to AWS.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| build_env | string | The environment being built (staging or production) |
| deploy_env | string | The environment being deployed to (staging, production, or sandbox) |
| location_services_cdk_stack | string | Name of the Location Services CDK stack |
| secrets_cdk_stack | string | Name of the Secrets CDK stack |
| cdk_stack | string | Name of the main CDK stack |
| ihe_stack | string | Name of the IHE CDK stack |
| add_sentry_release | string | Whether to add a Sentry release |
| is-branch-to-staging | boolean | Whether to checkout internal's develop/master or a feature branch |
| AWS_REGION | string | AWS region for deployment |

#### Secrets
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| SERVICE_PAT | GitHub Personal Access Token |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS Access Key ID |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS Secret Access Key |
| SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN | Sentry authentication token |
| SENTRY_ORG | Sentry organization name |
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | Docker Hub username |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | Docker Hub token |

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up the environment and log in to Docker Hub
2. Checkout the main repository and the internal repository
3. Install and build dependencies
4. Run tests
5. Create a Sentry release (currently disabled)
6. Deploy the Secrets CDK Stack
7. Deploy the Location Services CDK Stack (if specified)
8. Deploy the API CDK Stack
9. Deploy the IHE CDK Stack (if specified)

Each deployment step includes a diff operation followed by the actual deployment.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checking out code repositories |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | Setting up Node.js environment |
| docker/login-action@v2 | Logging in to Docker Hub |
| getsentry/action-release@v1 | Creating Sentry releases |
| metriport/deploy-with-cdk@master | Custom action for CDK deployment |

## Error Handling
The workflow uses the default error handling provided by GitHub Actions. If any step fails, the workflow will stop and report the error.

## Logging
The workflow includes a step to log the environment variables at the beginning of the job. It also uses the `--verbose` flag in CDK deployment commands for detailed logging.

## TODOs
1. Consider the solution for preventing concurrent deployments as mentioned in the comment: https://github.com/tj-actions/aws-cdk/blob/main/action.yml
2. The Sentry release creation is currently disabled due to an issue. It's waiting for Sentry support (TODO: #156).
