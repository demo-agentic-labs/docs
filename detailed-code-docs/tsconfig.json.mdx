title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This `tsconfig.json` file is the root TypeScript configuration for a monorepo project. It sets up global compiler options and references multiple sub-projects within the repository, enabling TypeScript's project references feature for better build performance and code organization.

## Code Structure
The configuration is divided into three main sections: `compilerOptions`, `exclude`, and `references`. The `compilerOptions` section defines global settings, while the `references` section lists the sub-projects within the monorepo.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
Specifies the compiler options to be used for the TypeScript project.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up Jest types for testing
- Defines type roots for custom type definitions and @types
- Enables full error messages and skips type checking of declaration files

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| types | array | ["jest"] | Includes Jest types for testing support |
| typeRoots | array | ["./types", "./node_modules/@types"] | Specifies locations for type definitions |
| noErrorTruncation | boolean | true | Prevents truncation of error messages |
| skipLibCheck | boolean | true | Skips type checking of declaration files |

### exclude
#### Description
Specifies which directories should be excluded from the TypeScript compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Excludes the `node_modules` directory to prevent compilation of external dependencies.

### files
#### Description
An empty array that doesn't include any specific files for compilation in the root configuration.

### references
#### Description
Defines the project references for the monorepo, enabling TypeScript's project references feature.

#### Internal Logic
Lists the paths to the `tsconfig.ref.json` files of various packages within the monorepo. Each reference points to a separate TypeScript project, allowing for better build performance and code organization.

| Package | Path |
|:--------|:-----|
| api | ./packages/api/tsconfig.ref.json |
| api-sdk | ./packages/api-sdk/tsconfig.ref.json |
| commonwell-cert-runner | ./packages/commonwell-cert-runner/tsconfig.ref.json |
| commonwell-jwt-maker | ./packages/commonwell-jwt-maker/tsconfig.ref.json |
| commonwell-sdk | ./packages/commonwell-sdk/tsconfig.ref.json |
| carequality-cert-runner | ./packages/carequality-cert-runner/tsconfig.ref.json |
| core | ./packages/core/tsconfig.ref.json |
| infra | ./packages/infra/tsconfig.ref.json |
| react-native-sdk | ./packages/react-native-sdk/tsconfig.ref.json |
| utils | ./packages/utils/tsconfig.ref.json |

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't directly depend on external libraries, but it sets up the project to use TypeScript and Jest for testing.

## Configuration
The main configuration options are defined in the `compilerOptions` section, as described above.

## Performance Considerations
The use of project references (`references` section) can significantly improve build performance in large monorepo projects by enabling incremental compilation and allowing TypeScript to only rebuild affected projects.
