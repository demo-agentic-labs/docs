## High-level description

This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration files and workflows for the Metriport project. It includes issue templates, pull request templates, Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) configuration, and GitHub Actions workflows. These files are designed to streamline the development process, maintain code quality, and automate various tasks such as continuous integration, deployment, and SDK releases.

## What does it do?

The contents of this directory serve several important functions:

1. Issue Management: Provides structured templates for bug reports and feature requests, ensuring that users submit comprehensive and consistent information.

2. Pull Request Process: Offers a template for pull requests, guiding contributors to provide necessary details about their changes, testing procedures, and release plans.

3. Commit Signing: Configures the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) app to manage commit sign-offs for the repository.

4. Automated Workflows: Implements a wide range of GitHub Actions workflows that automate various aspects of the development lifecycle, including:
   - Continuous Integration: Running tests and linters on pull requests
   - Continuous Deployment: Deploying to staging, production, and sandbox environments
   - SDK Management: Generating and releasing SDKs for multiple programming languages
   - Service Management: Restarting API services in different environments
   - End-to-End Testing: Running E2E tests against staging environments
   - Infrastructure as Code: Deploying and updating AWS resources using CDK

These components work together to create a robust development environment that promotes code quality, efficient issue tracking, and automated processes for testing, deployment, and releases.

## Key Files

1. Issue Templates (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml` and `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml`): These YAML files define structured templates for bug reports and feature requests, ensuring that users provide all necessary information when submitting issues.

2. Pull Request Template (`pull_request_template.md`): This Markdown file provides a standardized format for pull requests, prompting contributors to include details about their changes, testing procedures, and release plans.

3. DCO Configuration (`dco.yml`): This YAML file configures the Developer Certificate of Origin app, specifying that organization members are not required to sign off on their commits.

4. GitHub Actions Workflows (`workflows/` directory): This directory contains numerous YAML files defining various automated workflows for the project. Key workflows include:
   - `_build.yml`: A reusable workflow for building and testing packages
   - `_deploy-api.yml`: A reusable workflow for deploying the API
   - `deploy-production.yml` and `deploy-staging.yml`: Workflows for deploying to production and staging environments
   - `release-all-sdks.yml`: Workflow for releasing SDKs for multiple languages
   - Various `pull-request_*.yml` files: Workflows for checking and building specific packages on pull requests
   - Various `restart_*.yml` files: Workflows for restarting services in different environments

## Dependencies

The GitHub Actions workflows rely on several external services and tools:

1. GitHub Actions: The underlying platform for running the automated workflows
2. AWS Services: Many workflows interact with AWS services like ECR and ECS
3. Docker: Used for containerization and authentication with DockerHub
4. Node.js: Used in many workflows for building and testing JavaScript/TypeScript packages
5. Fern: A tool used for generating and releasing SDKs
6. Various GitHub Actions: Such as `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, and `docker/login-action`

## Configuration

The workflows and templates use various configuration options:

1. Issue Templates: Configure labels and required fields for bug reports and feature requests
2. DCO Configuration: Specifies whether organization members need to sign off on commits
3. GitHub Actions Workflows: Use a combination of GitHub secrets and variables for configuration, including:
   - AWS credentials
   - Docker credentials
   - Environment-specific variables (e.g., ECR URIs, ECS cluster names, API URLs)
   - SDK-related tokens (e.g., NPM, PyPI, Maven)
   - Service-specific secrets

These configurations allow the workflows to be flexible and work across different environments while keeping sensitive information secure.
