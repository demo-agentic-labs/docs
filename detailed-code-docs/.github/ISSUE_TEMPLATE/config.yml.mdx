## High-level description

This YAML configuration file is used to disable blank issues in a GitHub repository. It's a simple yet effective way to control how users can create new issues, ensuring that all issues are created using predefined templates.

## Symbols

### `blank_issues_enabled`

#### Description

This is a boolean configuration option that determines whether blank issues are allowed in the GitHub repository.

#### Inputs

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| blank_issues_enabled | boolean | A flag to enable or disable blank issues |

#### Outputs

There are no direct outputs from this configuration. The effect is applied to the GitHub repository's issue creation process.

#### Internal Logic

When set to `false`, this option prevents users from creating issues without using a predefined template. This encourages more structured and informative issue reporting.

## Side Effects

Setting `blank_issues_enabled` to `false` has the following effects on the repository:

1. Users will not be able to create issues without selecting a template.
2. All new issues must follow one of the predefined issue templates.
3. This may improve issue quality and consistency but might also create a barrier for users who have valid issues that don't fit into existing templates.

## Dependencies

This configuration file is dependent on GitHub's issue management system. It's specifically used by GitHub to control issue creation behavior.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GitHub Issues | Controls the behavior of issue creation in the repository |

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| blank_issues_enabled | boolean | true (if not specified) | Determines whether blank issues can be created |

Note: The default value is assumed to be `true` if not specified, based on typical GitHub behavior. Setting it to `false` explicitly disables blank issues.

## API/Interface Reference

While this isn't an API in the traditional sense, it does interface with GitHub's issue management system:

| Option | Effect | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| blank_issues_enabled: false | Disables blank issues | Prevents users from creating issues without using a template |

This configuration is part of GitHub's Issue Template feature, which allows repository maintainers to customize the issue creation process.
