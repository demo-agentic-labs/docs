## High-level description
This YAML file defines a template for creating bug reports in a GitHub repository. It provides a structured format for users to submit detailed information about bugs they encounter, ensuring that the development team receives consistent and comprehensive bug reports.

## Code Structure
The YAML file defines a single issue template with various fields that users need to fill out when reporting a bug. The structure includes metadata about the template and a body section with different types of input fields.

### Bug Report Template
#### Description
This is the main structure of the bug report template. It defines the name, description, title format, and labels for the issue, as well as the body of the report containing various input fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the template |
| description | string | A brief description of the template's purpose |
| title | string | The default title format for the issue |
| labels | array of strings | Default labels to be applied to the issue |
| body | array of objects | The input fields that make up the body of the bug report |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses various types of input fields to collect information:
1. A markdown field to provide instructions and guidelines to the user.
2. Textarea fields for steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, environment details, and additional comments.
3. Each field has attributes like label and description to guide the user in providing the necessary information.

## Dependencies
This template relies on GitHub's issue template system, which uses YAML format to define structured issue forms.

## Configuration
The template configures the following options for the bug report:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | "Bug Report" | The name of the template |
| title | string | "[Bug]: " | The prefix for the issue title |
| labels | array | ["bug", "triage"] | Default labels for the issue |

## Error Handling
The template includes validation for required fields:
- The "Steps to reproduce" field is marked as required.
- The "What did you expect to happen?" field is marked as required.
- The "What is actually happening?" field is marked as required.

This ensures that users provide the most critical information needed to understand and reproduce the bug.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this template defines the interface for submitting bug reports:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| Steps to reproduce | textarea | Yes | Detailed steps to recreate the bug |
| Expected behavior | textarea | Yes | What the user expected to happen |
| Actual behavior | textarea | Yes | What actually happened (the bug) |
| Environment | textarea | No | Optional details about the user's environment |
| Additional comments | textarea | No | Any other relevant information |

This structured format ensures that all necessary information is collected consistently across all bug reports.
